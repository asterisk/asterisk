* EVERYTHING MARKED WITH "XXX" IN THE SOURCE REPRESENTS A BUG!  Sometimes
  these bugs are in asterisk, and sometimes they relate to the products
  that asterisk uses.

* In general Asterisk is a very new program, and there are liable to be
  many bugs yet to be discovered, so if you think you've found one, please
  be sure to report it.

* When you flip to call waiting on a tormenta channel while you have a
  three way call up, the parties in the three way cannot hear one another
  in the general case.

======================================================================
Short report on the voicemail system
======================================================================
Stuff We Need:

-Date/Time (conversion on the fly for different locales)
-A more fleshed/emphasized Main Menu
-Mailbox Options
	-useful for allowing user to set certain options
-Notification of new vs. old messages
-Notification of first and last messages (old and new)
	and a return to the Main Menu @ the end
**-Better handling of lack of user input, specifically...
	infinite loops...
	currently found in:  vm-instructions
			     vm-msginstruct
	System MUST disconnect user for inactivity
-Mid message menu w/
	pause/unpause
	seeking
	callback option
	option to get caller's number if available
	option to leave message directly on caller's voicemail
		if he/she has account on system
-Also redesign the End Of Message Menu
-Efficienty Question...
	Better to always rename msgs to being @ 0001
	or...
	Better to append new msgs numerically @ the
	end and use software to traverse them in 
	order...saving cpu cycles on renaming files
	..could get messy w/ lots of users
