=== These files document all the changes that MUST be taken

=== modules or patches. These files also include advance
=== notice of any functionality that has been marked as
=== 'deprecated' and may be removed in a future release,
=== along with the suggested replacement functionality.

Channel Drivers:

chan_dahdi:
 - For users using the FXO port (FXS signaling) distinctive ring detection
   feature, you will need to adjust the dringX count values.  The count
   values now only record ring end events instead of any DAHDI event.  A
   ring-ring-ring pattern would exceed the pattern limits and stop
   Caller-ID detection.

Core:

AMI:
 - The 'ModuleCheck' Action's Version key will no longer show the module
   version. The value will always be blank.

CLI:
 - The 'core show file version' command has been removed. When Asterisk
   moved to Git, the source control version support was removed. As a
   result, the CLi command was no longer useful and was removed as well.

Logging:
 - The first callid created is now 1 instead of 0.  The value 0
   is now reserved to represent a lack of callid.

AMI:
 - The Command action now sends the output from the CLI command as a series
   of Output headers for each line instead of as a block of text with the
   --END COMMAND-- delimiter to match the output from other actions.

   Commands that fail to execute (no such command, invalid syntax etc.) now
   return an Error response instead of Success.
