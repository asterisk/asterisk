Information for Upgrading From Previous Asterisk Releases
=========================================================

Applications:

* In previous Asterisk releases, many applications would jump to priority n+101
  to indicate some kind of status or error condition.  This functionality was
  marked deprecated in Asterisk 1.2.  An option to disable it was provided with
  the default value set to 'on'.  The default value for the global priority
  jumping option is now 'off'.

* The applications Cut, Sort, DBGet, DBPut, SetCIDNum, SetCIDName, SetRDNIS,
  AbsoluteTimeout, DigitTimeout, ResponseTimeout, SetLanguage, GetGroupCount,
  and GetGroupMatchCount were all deprecated in version 1.2, and therefore have
  been removed in this version.  You should use the equivalent dialplan
  function in places where you have previously used one of these applications.

* The application SetVar has been renamed to Set.  The syntax SetVar was marked
  deprecated in version 1.2 and is no longer recognized in this version.

* app_read has been updated to use the newer options codes, using "skip" or
  "noanswer" will not work.  Use s or n.  Also there is a new feature i, for
  using indication tones, so typing in skip would give you unexpected results.

Variables:

* The builtin variables ${CALLERID}, ${CALLERIDNAME}, ${CALLERIDNUM},
  ${CALLERANI}, ${DNID}, ${RDNIS}, ${DATETIME}, ${TIMESTAMP}, ${ACCOUNTCODE},
  and ${LANGUAGE} have all been deprecated in favor of their related dialplan
  functions.  You are encouraged to move towards the associated dialplan
  function, as these variables will be removed in a future release.

Functions:

* The function ${CHECK_MD5()} has been deprecated in favor of using an
  expression: $[${MD5(<string>)} = ${saved_md5}].

The SIP channel:

* The "incominglimit" setting is replaced by the "call-limit" setting in sip.conf.

Installation:

* On BSD systems, the installation directories have changed to more "FreeBSDish" directories. On startup, Asterisk will look for the main configuration in /usr7local/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf
If you have an old installation, you might want to remove the binaries and move the configuration files to the new locations. The following directories are now default:
	ASTLIBDIR	/usr/local/lib/asterisk
	ASTVARLIBDIR	/usr/local/share/asterisk
	ASTETCDIR	/usr/local/etc/asterisk
	ASTBINDIR	/usr/local/bin/asterisk
	ASTSBINDIR	/usr/local/sbin/asterisk
