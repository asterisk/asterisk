===========================================================

From 1.8 to 1.10:

cel_pgsql:
 - This module now expects an 'extra' column in the database for data added
   using the CELGenUserEvent() application.

ConfBridge
 - ConfBridge's dialplan arguments have changed and are not
   backwards compatible.

File Interpreters
 - The format interpreter formats/format_sln16.c for the file extension
   '.sln16' has been removed. The '.sln16' file interpreter now exists
   in the formats/format_sln.c module along with new support for sln12,
   sln24, sln32, sln44, sln48, sln96, and sln192 file extensions.

HTTP:
 - A bindaddr must be specified in order for the HTTP server
   to run. Previous versions would default to 0.0.0.0 if no
   bindaddr was specified.

Gtalk:
 - The default value for 'context' and 'parkinglots' in gtalk.conf has
   been changed to 'default', previously they were empty.

chan_dahdi:
 - The mohinterpret=passthrough setting is deprecated in favor of
   moh_signaling=notify.

pbx_lua:
 - Execution no longer continues after applications that do dialplan jumps
   (such as app.goto).  Now when an application such as app.goto() is called,
   control is returned back to the pbx engine and the current extension
   function stops executing.
 - the autoservice now defaults to being on by default
 - autoservice_start() and autoservice_start() no longer return a value.

Queue:
 - Mark QUEUE_MEMBER_PENALTY Deprecated it never worked for realtime members
 - QUEUE_MEMBER is now R/W supporting setting paused, ignorebusy and penalty.

 Asterisk Database:
 - The internal Asterisk database has been switched from Berkeley DB 1.86 to
   SQLite 3. An existing Berkeley astdb file can be converted with the astdb2sqlite3
   utility in the UTILS section of menuselect. If an existing astdb is found and no
   astdb.sqlite3 exists, astdb2sqlite3 will be compiled automatically. Asterisk will
   convert an existing astdb to the SQLite3 version automatically at runtime.
