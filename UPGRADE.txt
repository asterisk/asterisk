===========================================================

New in 15.0.0:

Core:
 - The 'Data Retrieval API' has been removed. This API was not actively
   maintained, was not added to new modules (such as res_pjsip), and there
   exist better alternatives to acquire the same information, such as the
   ARI. As a result, the 'DataGet' AMI action as well as the 'data get'
   CLI command have been removed.

From 14.4.0 to 14.5.0:

Core:
 - Support for embedded modules has been removed.  This has not worked in
   many years.  LOADABLE_MODULES menuselect option is also removed as
   loadable module support is now always enabled.

From 14.3.0 to 14.4.0:

res_rtp_asterisk:
 - The RTP layer of Asterisk now has support for RFC 5761: "Multiplexing RTP
   Data and Control Packets on a Single Port." For the PJSIP channel driver,
   chan_pjsip, you can set "rtcp_mux = yes" on a PJSIP endpoint in pjsip.conf
   to enable the feature. For chan_sip you can set "rtcp_mux = yes" either
   globally or on a per-peer basis in sip.conf.

New in 14.0.0

ARI:
 - The policy for when to send "Dial" events has changed. Previously, "Dial"
   events were sent on the calling channel's topic. However, starting in Asterisk
   14, if there is no calling channel on which to send the event, the event is
   instead sent on the called channel's topic. Note that for the ARI channels
   resource's dial operation, this means that the "Dial" events will always be
   sent on the called channel's topic.

Queue:
 - When reloading the members of a queue, the members added dynamically (i.e.
   added via the CLI command "queue add" or the AMI action "QueueAdd") now have
   their ringinuse value updated to the value of the queue. Previously, the
   ringinuse value for dynamic members was not updated on reload.

Queue log:
 - New RINGCANCELED event is logged when the caller hangs up while ringing.
   The data1 field contains number of miliseconds since start of ringing.

Channel Drivers:

chan_dahdi:
 - Support for specifying a DAHDI channel using a path under /dev/dahdi
   ("by name") has been removed. It was never used. Instead you should
   use kernel-level channel number allocation using span assignments.
   See the documentation of dahdi-linux and dahdi-tools.
