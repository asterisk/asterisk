=== Information for upgrading between Asterisk versions
===
=== These files document all the changes that MUST be taken

=== you modify your configuration files, dialplan or (in
=== some cases) source code if you have your own Asterisk
=== modules or patches. These files also include advance
=== notice of any functionality that has been marked as
=== 'deprecated' and may be removed in a future release,
=== along with the suggested replacement functionality.

Channel Drivers:

chan_dahdi:
 - For users using the FXO port (FXS signaling) distinctive ring detection
   feature, you will need to adjust the dringX count values.  The count
   values now only record ring end events instead of any DAHDI event.  A
   ring-ring-ring pattern would exceed the pattern limits and stop
   Caller-ID detection.

Core:
 - The REF_DEBUG compiler flag is now used to enable refdebug by default.
   The setting can be overridden in asterisk.conf by setting refdebug in
   the options category.  No recompile is required to enable/disable it.

 - Modified processing of command-line options to first parse only what
   is necessary to read asterisk.conf. Once asterisk.conf is fully loaded,
   the remaining options are processed.  The -X option now applies to
   asterisk.conf only.  To enable #exec for other config files you must
   set execincludes=yes in asterisk.conf.  Any other option set on the
   command-line will now override the equivalent setting from asterisk.conf.

AMI:
 - The 'ModuleCheck' Action's Version key will no longer show the module
   version. The value will always be blank.

CLI:
 - The 'core show file version' command has been removed. When Asterisk
   moved to Git, the source control version support was removed. As a
   result, the CLi command was no longer useful and was removed as well.

Logging:
 - The first callid created is now 1 instead of 0.  The value 0
   is now reserved to represent a lack of callid.

AMI:
 - The Command action now sends the output from the CLI command as a series
   of Output headers for each line instead of as a block of text with the
   --END COMMAND-- delimiter to match the output from other actions.

   Commands that fail to execute (no such command, invalid syntax etc.) now
   return an Error response instead of Success.

app_amd:
 - The 'maximum_number_of_words' configuration option and parameter to the AMD
   application previously did not match the documented functionality + variable
   name.  In Asterisk 13, a value of '3' would mean that if '3' words were detected,
   the result would be detection as a 'MACHINE'.  As of this version, the value
   reflects the maximum words that if EXCEEDED (rather than reached), would
   result in detection as a machine.  This means that you should update this
   value to be one higher than your previos value, if your previous value
   was working well for you.
