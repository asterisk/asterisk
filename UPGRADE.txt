=== Information for upgrading between Asterisk versions
===
=== These files document all the changes that MUST be taken

=== versions listed below. These changes may require that
=== you modify your configuration files, dialplan or (in
=== some cases) source code if you have your own Asterisk
=== modules or patches. These files also include advance
=== notice of any functionality that has been marked as
=== 'deprecated' and may be removed in a future release,
=== along with the suggested replacement functionality.

Channel Drivers:

chan_dahdi:
 - For users using the FXO port (FXS signaling) distinctive ring detection
   feature, you will need to adjust the dringX count values.  The count
   values now only record ring end events instead of any DAHDI event.  A
   ring-ring-ring pattern would exceed the pattern limits and stop
   Caller-ID detection.

Core:
 - The REF_DEBUG compiler flag is now used to enable refdebug by default.
   The setting can be overridden in asterisk.conf by setting refdebug in
   the options category.  No recompile is required to enable/disable it.

 - Most command-line options are now processed after asterisk.conf.  The
   only command-line options that are processed first are needed to read
   asterisk.conf.  The -X option now applies to asterisk.conf only.  To
   enable #exec from other config files you must set execincludes=yes in
   asterisk.conf.  Any other option set on the command-line will now
   override the equivalent setting from asterisk.conf.

AMI:
 - The 'ModuleCheck' Action's Version key will no longer show the module
   version. The value will always be blank.

CLI:
 - The 'core show file version' command has been removed. When Asterisk
   moved to Git, the source control version support was removed. As a
   result, the CLi command was no longer useful and was removed as well.

Logging:
 - The first callid created is now 1 instead of 0.  The value 0
   is now reserved to represent a lack of callid.

AMI:
 - The Command action now sends the output from the CLI command as a series
   of Output headers for each line instead of as a block of text with the
   --END COMMAND-- delimiter to match the output from other actions.

   Commands that fail to execute (no such command, invalid syntax etc.) now
   return an Error response instead of Success.
