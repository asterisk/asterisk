=== Information for upgrading between Asterisk versions
===
=== These files document all the changes that MUST be taken
=== into account when upgrading between the Asterisk
=== versions listed below. These changes may require that
=== you modify your configuration files, dialplan or (in
=== some cases) source code if you have your own Asterisk
=== modules or patches. These files also include advance
=== notice of any functionality that has been marked as
=== 'deprecated' and may be removed in a future release,
=== along with the suggested replacement functionality.

===========================================================
From 12.1.0 to 12.2.0:
PJSIP:
 - The PJSIP registrar now stores the contents of the User-Agent header of incoming
   REGISTER requests for each contact that is registered. If using realtime for
   PJSIP contacts, this means that the schema has been updated to add a user_agent
   column. An alembic revision has been added to facilitate this update.
 
 - PJSIP endpoints now have a "message_context" option that can be used to determine
   where to route incoming MESSAGE requests from the endpoint.

IAX2:
 - When communicating with a peer on an Asterisk 1.4 or earlier system, the
   chan_iax2 parameter 'connectedline' must be set to "no" in iax.conf. This
   prevents an incompatible connected line frame from an Astersik 1.8 or later
   system from causing a hangup in an Asterisk 1.4 or earlier system. Note that
   this particular incompatibility has always existed between 1.4 and 1.8 and
   later versions; this upgrade note is simply informing users of its existance.

Realtime Configuration:
 - PJSIP endpoint columns 'tos_audio' and 'tos_video' have been changed from yes/no
   enumerators to string values. 'cos_audio' and 'cos_video' have been changed from
   yes/no enumerators to integer values. PJSIP transport column 'tos' has been
   changed from a yes/no enumerator to a string value. 'cos' has been changed from
   a yes/no enumerator to an integer value.

From 12.0.0 to 12.1.0:
* The sound_place_into_conference sound used in Confbridge is now deprecated
  and is no longer functional since it has been broken since its inception
  and the fix involved using a different method to achieve the same goal. The
  new method to achieve this functionality is by using sound_begin to play
  a sound to the conference when waitmarked users are moved into the conference.

From 12 to 13:

- The per console verbose level feature as previously implemented caused a
  large performance penalty.  The fix required some minor incompatibilities
  if the new rasterisk is used to connect to an earlier version.  If the new
  rasterisk connects to an older Asterisk version then the root console verbose
  level is always affected by the "core set verbose" command of the remote
  console even though it may appear to only affect the current console.  If
  an older version of rasterisk connects to the new version then the
  "core set verbose" command will have no effect.

ARI:
 - The ARI version has been changed from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0. This is to reflect
   the backwards compatible changes listed below.

 - Added a new ARI resource 'mailboxes' which allows the creation and
   modification of mailboxes managed by external MWI. Modules res_mwi_external
   and res_stasis_mailbox must be enabled to use this resource.

 - Added new events for externally initiated transfers. The event
   BridgeBlindTransfer is now raised when a channel initiates a blind transfer
   of a bridge in the ARI controlled application to the dialplan; the
   BridgeAttendedTransfer event is raised when a channel initiates an
   attended transfer of a bridge in the ARI controlled application to the
   dialplan.

 - Channel variables may now be specified as a body parameter to the
   POST /channels operation. The 'variables' key in the JSON is interpreted
   as a sequence of key/value pairs that will be added to the created channel
   as channel variables. Other parameters in the JSON body are treated as
   query parameters of the same name.

AMI:
 - The AMI version has been changed from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0. This is to reflect
   the backwards compatible changes listed below.

 - The DialStatus field in the DialEnd event can now have additional values.
   This includes ABORT, CONTINUE, and GOTO.

 - The res_mwi_external_ami module can, if loaded, provide additional AMI
   actions and events that convey MWI state within Asterisk. This includes
   the MWIGet, MWIUpdate, and MWIDelete actions, as well as the MWIGet and
   MWIGetComplete events that occur in response to an MWIGet action.

 - AMI now contains a new class authorization, 'security'. This is used with
   the following new events: FailedACL, InvalidAccountID, SessionLimit,
   MemoryLimit, LoadAverageLimit, RequestNotAllowed, AuthMethodNotAllowed,
   RequestBadFormat, SuccessfulAuth, UnexpectedAddress, ChallengeResponseFailed,
   InvalidPassword, ChallengeSent, and InvalidTransport.

 - Bridge related events now have two additional fields: BridgeName and
   BridgeCreator. BridgeName is a descriptive name for the bridge;
   BridgeCreator is the name of the entity that created the bridge. This
   affects the following events: ConfbridgeStart, ConfbridgeEnd,
   ConfbridgeJoin, ConfbridgeLeave, ConfbridgeRecord, ConfbridgeStopRecord,
   ConfbridgeMute, ConfbridgeUnmute, ConfbridgeTalking, BlindTransfer,
   AttendedTransfer, BridgeCreate, BridgeDestroy, BridgeEnter, BridgeLeave

CDRs:
 - The "endbeforehexten" setting now defaults to "yes", instead of "no".
   When set to "no", yhis setting will cause a new CDR to be generated when a
   channel enters into hangup logic (either the 'h' extension or a hangup
   handler subroutine). In general, this is not the preferred default: this
   causes extra CDRs to be generated for a channel in many common dialplans.

CLI commands:
 - "core show settings" now lists the current console verbosity in addition
   to the root console verbosity.

 - "core set verbose" has not been able to support the by module verbose
   logging levels since verbose logging levels were made per console.  That
   syntax is now removed and a silence option added in its place.

Configuration Files:
 - The 'verbose' setting in logger.conf still takes an optional argument,
   specifying the verbosity level for each logging destination.  However,
   the default is now to once again follow the current root console level.
   As a result, using the AMI Command action with "core set verbose" could
   again set the root console verbose level and affect the verbose level
   logged.

 - The manager.conf 'eventfilter' now takes an "extended" regular expression
   instead of a "basic" one.

ODBC:
- The compatibility setting, allow_empty_string_in_nontext, has been removed.
  Empty column values will be stored as empty strings during realtime updates.

Realtime Configuration:
 - WARNING: The database migration script that adds the 'extensions' table for
   realtime had to be modified due to an error when installing for MySQL.  The
   'extensions' table's 'id' column was changed to be a primary key.  This could
   potentially cause a migration problem.  If so, it may be necessary to
   manually alter the affected table/column to bring it back in line with the
   migration scripts.

 - New columns have been added to realtime tables for 'support_path' on
   ps_registrations and ps_aors and for 'path' on ps_contacts for the new
   SIP Path support in chan_pjsip.

 - The following new tables have been added for pjsip realtime: 'ps_systems',
   'ps_globals', 'ps_tranports', 'ps_registrations'.

 - The following columns were added to the 'ps_aors' realtime table:
   'maximum_expiration', 'outbound_proxy', and 'support_path'.

 - The following columns were added to the 'ps_contacts' realtime table:
   'outbound_proxy' and 'path'.

 - New columns have been added to the ps_endpoints realtime table for the
   'media_address', 'redirect_method' and 'set_var' options.  Also the
   'mwi_fromuser' column was renamed to 'mwi_from_user'.

 - A new column was added to the 'ps_globals' realtime table for the 'debug'
   option.
