From 15.2.1 to 15.2.2:

res_pjsip_transport_management:
 - Since res_pjsip_transport_management provides several attack
   mitigation features, its functionality moved to res_pjsip and
   this module has been removed.  This way the features will always
   be available if res_pjsip is loaded.

New in 15.0.0:

Build System:
 - '--with-pjproject-bundled' is now the default when running ./configure
   It can be disabled with '--without-pjproject-bundled'.

Core:
 - Multi-stream support has been added so a channel can have multiple
   streams of the same type such as audio and video.

 - The 'Data Retrieval API' has been removed. This API was not actively
   maintained, was not added to new modules (such as res_pjsip), and there
   exist better alternatives to acquire the same information, such as the
   ARI. As a result, the 'DataGet' AMI action as well as the 'data get'
   CLI command have been removed.
