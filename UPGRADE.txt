===========================================================

Build System:
 - The LOW_MEMORY compile option no longer disables inline API.  To disable
   inline API you must use the DISABLE_INLINE option.

Queue:
 - When reloading the members of a queue, the members added dynamically (i.e.
   added via the CLI command "queue add" or the AMI action "QueueAdd") now have
   their ringinuse value updated to the value of the queue. Previously, the
   ringinuse value for dynamic members was not updated on reload.

Channel Drivers:

chan_dahdi:
 - Support for specifying a DAHDI channel using a path under /dev/dahdi
   ("by name") has been removed. It was never used. Instead you should
   use kernel-level channel number allocation using span assignments.
   See the documentation of dahdi-linux and dahdi-tools.
