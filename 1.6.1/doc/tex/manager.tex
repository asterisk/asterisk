\section{The Asterisk Manager TCP/IP API}

The manager is a client/server model over TCP. With the manager interface,
you'll be able to control the PBX, originate calls, check mailbox status,
monitor channels and queues as well as execute Asterisk commands.

AMI is the standard management interface into your Asterisk server.
You configure AMI in manager.conf. By default, AMI is available on
TCP port 5038 if you enable it in manager.conf.

AMI receive commands, called "actions". These generate a "response"
from Asterisk. Asterisk will also send "Events" containing various
information messages about changes within Asterisk. Some actions
generate an initial response and data in the form list of events.
This format is created to make sure that extensive reports do not
block the manager interface fully.

Management users are configured in the configuration file manager.conf and are
given permissions for read and write, where write represents their ability
to perform this class of "action", and read represents their ability to
receive this class of "event".

If you develop AMI applications, treat the headers
in Actions, Events and Responses as local to that particular
message. There is no cross-message standardization of headers.

If you develop applications, please try to reuse existing manager
headers and their interpretation. If you are unsure, discuss on
the asterisk-dev mailing list.

\section{Device status reports}

Manager subscribes to extension status reports from all channels,
to be able to generate events when an extension or device changes
state. The level of details in these events may depend on the channel
and device configuration. Please check each channel configuration
file for more information. (in sip.conf, check the section on
subscriptions and call limits)


\section{Command Syntax}

Management communication consists of tags of the form "header: value",
terminated with an empty newline (\textbackslash r\textbackslash n) in 
the style of SMTP, HTTP, and other headers.

The first tag MUST be one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Action: An action requested by the CLIENT to the Asterisk SERVER. 
        Only one "Action" may be outstanding at any time.
    \item Response: A response to an action from the Asterisk SERVER to the CLIENT.
    \item Event: An event reported by the Asterisk SERVER to the CLIENT
\end{itemize}

\section{Manager commands}

To see all of the available manager commands, use the "manager show commands"
CLI command.

You can get more information about a manager command
with the "manager show command $<$command$>$" CLI command in Asterisk.

\section{Examples}

Login - Log a user into the manager interface.

\begin{verbatim}
   Action: Login
   Username: testuser
   Secret: testsecret
\end{verbatim}

Originate - Originate a call from a channel to an extension.

\begin{verbatim}
   Action: Originate
   Channel: sip/12345
   Exten: 1234
   Context: default
\end{verbatim}

Originate - Originate a call from a channel to an extension without waiting
for call to complete.

\begin{verbatim}
   Action: Originate
   Channel: sip/12345
   Exten: 1234
   Context: default
   Async: yes
\end{verbatim}

Redirect with ExtraChannel:

  Attempted goal:
  Have a 'robot' program Redirect both ends of an already-connected call
  to a meetme room using the ExtraChannel feature through the management interface.

\begin{verbatim}
  Action: Redirect
  Channel: DAHDI/1-1
  ExtraChannel: SIP/3064-7e00 (varies)
  Exten: 680
  Priority: 1
\end{verbatim}

Where 680 is an extension that sends you to a MeetMe room.

There are a number of GUI tools that use the manager interface, please search
the mailing list archives and the documentation page on the
\url{http://www.asterisk.org} web site for more information.
