The advent of icecast into Asterisk allows you to do neat things like have
a caller stream right into an ice-cast stream as well as using chan\_local
to place things like conferences, music on hold, etc. into the stream.

You'll need to specify a config file for the ices encoder.  An example is
included in \path{contrib/asterisk-ices.xml}.
