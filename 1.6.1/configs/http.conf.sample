; Asterisk Builtin mini-HTTP server
;
;
; Note about Asterisk documentation:
;   If Asterisk was installed from a tarball, then the HTML documentation should
;   be installed in the static-http/docs directory which is
;   (/var/lib/asterisk/static-http/docs) on linux by default.  If the Asterisk
;   HTTP server is enabled in this file by setting the "enabled", "bindaddr",
;   and "bindport" options, then you should be able to view the documentation
;   remotely by browsing to:
;       http://<server_ip>:<bindport>/static/docs/index.html
;
[general]
;
; Whether HTTP/HTTPS interface is enabled or not.  Default is no.
; This also affects manager/rawman/mxml access (see manager.conf)
;
;enabled=yes
;
; Address to bind to, both for HTTP and HTTPS.  Default is 0.0.0.0
;
bindaddr=127.0.0.1
;
; Port to bind to for HTTP sessions (default is 8088)
;
;bindport=8088
;
; Prefix allows you to specify a prefix for all requests
; to the server.  The default is blank.  If uncommented
; all requests must begin with /asterisk
;
;prefix=asterisk
;
; Whether Asterisk should serve static content from http-static
; Default is no.
;
;enablestatic=yes
;
; Redirect one URI to another.  This is how you would set a
; default page.  
;   Syntax: redirect=<from here> <to there>
; For example, if you are using the Asterisk-gui,
; it is convenient to enable the following redirect:
;
;redirect = / /static/config/cfgbasic.html
;
; HTTPS support. In addition to enabled=yes, you need to
; explicitly enable ssl, define the port to use,
; and have a certificate somewhere.
; sslenable=yes		; enable ssl - default no.
; sslbindport=4433	; port to use - default is 8089
; sslbindaddr=0.0.0.0	; address to bind to - default is bindaddr.
;
; sslcert=/tmp/foo.pem	; path to the certificate
;
; To produce a certificate you can e.g. use openssl
;	openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /tmp/foo.pem -keyout /tmp/foo.pem
;

; The post_mappings section maps URLs to real paths on the filesystem.  If a
; POST is done from within an authenticated manager session to one of the
; configured POST mappings, then any files in the POST will be placed in the
; configured directory.
;
;[post_mappings]
;
; In this example, if the prefix option is set to "asterisk", then using the
; POST URL: /asterisk/uploads will put files in /var/lib/asterisk/uploads/.
;uploads = /var/lib/asterisk/uploads/
