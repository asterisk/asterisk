	  | 30 lines Fix deadlock when using dummy channels. Dummy channels
	  created by ast_dummy_channel_alloc() should be destoyed by
	  ast_channel_unref(). Using ast_channel_release() needlessly grabs
	  the channel container lock and can cause a deadlock as a result.
	  * Analyzed use of ast_dummy_channel_alloc() and made use
	  ast_channel_unref() when done with the dummy channel. (Primary
	  reason for the reported deadlock.) * Made
	  app_dial.c:dial_exec_full() not call ast_call() holding any
	  channel locks. Chan_local could not perform deadlock avoidance
	  correctly. (Potential deadlock exposed by this issue. Secondary
	  reason for the reported deadlock since the held lock was part of
	  the deadlock chain.) * Fixed some uses of
	  ast_dummy_channel_alloc() not checking the returned channel
	  pointer for failure. * Fixed some potential chan=NULL pointer
	  usage in func_odbc.c. Protected by testing the bogus_chan value.
	  * Fixed needlessly clearing a 1024 char auto array when setting
	  the first char to zero is enough in manager.c:action_getvar().

	  | 21 lines Fix for incorrect voicemail duration in external
	  notifications This patch fixes an issue where the voicemail
	  duration was being reported with a duration significantly less
	  than the actual sound file duration. Voicemails that contained
	  mostly silence were reporting the duration of only the sound in
	  the file, as opposed to the duration of the file with the
	  silence. This patch fixes this by having two durations reported
	  in the __ast_play_and_record family of functions - the
	  sound_duration and the actual duration of the file. The
	  sound_duration, which is optional, now reports the duration of
	  the sound in the file, while the actual full duration of the file
	  is reported in the duration parameter. This allows the voicemail
	  applications to use the sound_duration for minimum duration
	  checking, while reporting the full duration to external parties
	  if the voicemail is kept. (issue ASTERISK-2234) (closes issue

	  Sep 2011) | 36 lines Fix crashes in ast_rtcp_write(). This patch
	  addresses crashes related to RTCP handling. The backtraces just
	  show a crash in ast_rtcp_write() where it appears that the RTP
	  instance is no longer valid. There is a race condition with
	  scheduled RTCP transmissions and the destruction of the RTP
	  instance. This patch utilizes the fact that ast_rtp_instance is a
	  reference counted object and ensures that it will not get
	  destroyed while a reference is still around due to scheduled RTCP
	  transmissions. RTCP transmissions are scheduled and executed from
	  the chan_sip scheduler context. This scheduler context is
	  processed in the SIP monitor thread. The destruction of an RTP
	  instance occurs when the associated sip_pvt gets destroyed (which
	  happens when the sip_pvt reference count reaches 0). However, the
	  SIP monitor thread is not the only thread that can cause a
	  sip_pvt to get destroyed. The sip_hangup function, executed from
	  a channel thread, also decrements the reference count on a
	  sip_pvt and could cause it to get destroyed. While this is being
	  changed anyway, the patch also removes calling ast_sched_del()
	  from within the RTCP scheduler callback. It's not helpful. Simply
	  returning 0 prevents the callback from being rescheduled. (closes

	  frame When a SIP phone uses the dial application and receives a
	  484 Address Incomplete response, if overlapped dialing is enabled

	  SIP phone and the HANGUPCAUSE channel variable is set to 28.
	  Previously, the Incomplete application dialplan logic was
	  automatically triggered; now, explicit dialplan usage of the
	  application is required. Additionally, this patch adds a new
	  AST_CONTOL_FRAME type called AST_CONTROL_INCOMPLETE. If a channel
	  driver receives this control frame, it is an indication that the
	  dialplan expects more digits back from the device. If the device
	  supports overlap dialing it should attempt to notify the device
	  that the dialplan is waiting for more digits; otherwise, it can
	  handle the frame in a manner appropriate to the channel driver.

	  ast_odbc_clear_cache. As a function pointer, the reference has to
	  be resolved at load time irrespective of the RTLD_LAZY flag.
	  Creating a local alias solves this problem, because the structure
	  is initialized with that local function pointer, while the actual
	  function can remain lazily linked until runtime. The reason why
	  this is important is because we lazily load function references
	  during the module loading process, in order to obtain priority
	  values for each module, ensuring that modules are loaded in the
	  correct order. Previous to this change, when this module was
	  initially loaded, the module loader would emit a symbol
	  resolution error, because of the above requirement. Closes

	  | 43 lines Call pickup race leaves orphaned channels or crashes.
	  Multiple users attempting to pickup a call that has been forked
	  to multiple extensions either crashes or fails a masquerade with
	  a "bad things may happen" message. This is the scenario that is
	  causing all the grief: 1) Pickup target is selected 2) target is
	  marked as being picked up in ast_do_pickup() 3) target is
	  unlocked by ast_do_pickup() 4) app dial or queue gets a chance to
	  hang up losing calls and calls ast_hangup() on target 5) SINCE A
	  MASQUERADE HAS NOT BEEN SETUP YET BY ast_do_pickup() with
	  ast_channel_masquerade(), ast_hangup() completes successfully and
	  the channel is no longer in the channels container. 6)
	  ast_do_pickup() then calls ast_channel_masquerade() to schedule
	  the masquerade on the dead channel. 7) ast_do_pickup() then calls
	  ast_do_masquerade() on the dead channel 8) bad things happen
	  while doing the masquerade and in the process ast_do_masquerade()
	  puts the dead channel back into the channels container 9) The
	  "orphaned" channel is visible in the channels list if a crash
	  does not happen. This patch does the following: * Made
	  ast_hangup() set AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE on a successfully hung-up
	  channel and not release the channel lock until that has happened.
	  * Made __ast_channel_masquerade() not setup a masquerade if
	  either channel has AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE set. * Fix chan_agent misuse
	  of AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE since it would no longer work. (closes issue

	  | 26 lines Outgoing BRI calls fail when using Asterisk 1.8 with
	  HA8, HB8, and B410P cards. France Telecom brings layer 2 and
	  layer 1 down on BRI lines when the line is idle. When layer 1
	  goes down Asterisk cannot make outgoing calls and the HA8 and HB8
	  cards also get IRQ misses. The inability to make outgoing calls
	  is because the line is in red alarm and Asterisk will not make
	  calls over a line it considers unavailable. The IRQ misses for
	  the HA8 and HB8 card are because the hardware is switching clock
	  sources from the line which just brought layer 1 down to internal
	  timing. There is a DAHDI option for the B410P card to not tell
	  Asterisk that layer 1 went down so Asterisk will allow outgoing
	  calls: "modprobe wcb4xxp teignored=1". There is a similar DAHDI
	  option for the HA8 and HB8 cards: "modprobe wctdm24xxp
	  bri_teignored=1". Unfortunately that will not clear up the IRQ
	  misses when the telco brings layer 1 down. * Add layer 2
	  persistence option to customize the layer 2 behavior on BRI PTMP
	  lines. The new option has three settings: 1) Use libpri default
	  layer 2 setting. 2) Keep layer 2 up. Bring layer 2 back up when
	  the peer brings it down. 3) Leave layer 2 down when the peer
	  brings it down. Layer 2 will be brought up as needed for outgoing
	  calls. JIRA AST-598 ........

	  17 lines Fixes some voicemail forwarding behavior based around
	  prepend mode. Formerly, prepend forwarding would have the user
	  record a message with no useful prompt and an expectation for the
	  user to push a button on the phone when finished recording. If a
	  length of silence was detected instead, the recording would be
	  canceled and the user would re-enter the voicemail forwarding
	  menu. Subsequent time-outs in prepend recording would also bug
	  out in the sense that they would write over the original message
	  and get sent to the recipient regardless of whether they timed
	  out or were accepted. This patch fixes this issue and adds a
	  prompt which will be played after a timeout informing the user
	  that they needed to press a button. Currently, the sound files
	  that we have are somewhat inadquate for this, so after the call
	  we simply have Allison say "Please try again. Then press pound."
	  which actually relies on two separate sound files. Just one would
	  be more appropriate. reporter: Vlad Povorozniuc Review:

	  There are two remaining different deadlocks reported dealing with
	  dialplan hints. The deadlock in ASTERISK-17666 is caused by
	  invalid locking order in ast_remove_hint(). The hints container
	  must be locked before the hint object. The deadlock in
	  ASTERISK-17760 is caused by a catch-22 situation in
	  handle_statechange(). The deadlock is caused by not having the
	  conlock before calling the watcher callbacks. Unfortunately,
	  having that lock causes a different deadlock as reported in
	  ASTERISK-16961. * Fixed ast_remove_hint() locking order. * Made
	  handle_statechange() no longer call the watcher callbacks holding
	  any locks that matter. * Made hint ao2 destructor do the watcher
	  callbacks for extension deactivation to guarantee that they get
	  called. * Fixed hint reference leak in ast_add_hint() if the
	  callback container constructor failed. * Fixed hint reference
	  leak in complete_core_show_hint() for every hint it found for CLI
	  tab completion. * Adjusted locking in
	  ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() for safety. * Added

	  Mac OSX). Unfortunately, the changes were incomplete and did not
	  actually provide the desired behavior, and as a side effect the
	  functionality that ensured that stale headers in the Asterisk
	  'include' directory were removed got broken. In addition, the
	  check for stale (and possibly incompatible) modules in the
	  Asterisk 'modules' directory also got broken, and would never
	  report any stale modules. Users upgrading to this version or
	  later versions would then see unexpected module load errors.
	  Since there are few users who actually want to install Asterisk
	  into paths that contain spaces, and a proper fix for the build
	  system would take many hours, the best solution for now is to
	  just revert the partial solution. ........ ................

	  mixmonitor recordings. MixMonitor has the ability to record in
	  any file format Asterisk supports, but the quality of wideband
	  audio is not preserved. This is because regardless of the sample
	  rate the call is being recorded in, the audio is always
	  downsampled to 8khz and then upsampled to whatever wideband
	  format it is being written as. This patch resolves this by
	  requesting the audio from the audiohook in the signed linear
	  format closest to the sample rate of the format we are writing.
	  This fix is only possible for Asterisk 1.10 because audio hooks
	  in 1.8 are not capable of wideband audio. Review:

	  2011) | 14 lines Correct double-free situation in manager output
	  processing. The process_output() function calls ast_str_append()
	  and xml_translate() on its 'out' parameter, which is a pointer to
	  an ast_str buffer. If either of these functions need to
	  reallocate the ast_str so it will have more space, they will free
	  the existing buffer and allocate a new one, returning the address
	  of the new one. However, because process_output only receives a
	  pointer to the ast_str, not a pointer to its caller's variable
	  holding the pointer, if the original ast_str is freed, the caller
	  will not know, and will continue to use it (and later attempt to
	  free it). (reported by jkroon on #asterisk-dev) ........

	  | 14 lines Use 'printf' (POSIX issue 4) instead of 'echo -n', for
	  portability. The problem with using 'echo -n' is that it is not
	  portable. While BSD systems required that the '-n' option be
	  removed and interpreted, System V required that all strings
	  should be echoed with no interpretation of options. This
	  fundamental difference of behavior means that it is never
	  possible to use the '-n' flag to echo in tests which are meant to
	  be portable. In this case, on Mac OS X 10.6, the /bin/sh shell
	  builtin 'echo' uses the System V semantics of the command, and
	  thus the SHELL test failed on that platform.

	  some bugs in the very ancient version of Berkeley DB that
	  Asterisk used. Instead of spending the time tracking down the
	  bugs in the Berkeley code we move to the much better documented
	  SQLite 3. Conversion of the old astdb happens at runtime by
	  running the included astdb2sqlite3 utility. The ast_db API with
	  SQLite 3 backend should behave identically to the old Berkeley
	  backend, but in the future we could offer a much more robust
	  interface. We do not include the SQLite 3 library in the source
	  tree, but instead rely upon the distribution-provided libraries.
	  SQLite is so ubiquitous that this should not place undue burden
	  on administrators.

	  The idea behind the patch listed below was used, but in a more
	  targeted manner. There are now address stringification functions
	  for addresses that are meant to be sent to a remote party.
	  Link-local scope-ids only make sense on the machine from which
	  they originate and so are stripped in the new functions. There is
	  also a host sanitization function added to chan_sip which is used
	  for when peer and dialog tohost fields or sip_registry hostnames
	  are used to craft a SIP message. Also added are some basic unit
	  tests for netsock2 address parsing. (closes issue ASTERISK-17711)

	  extra byte outside of the bounds of the underlying fd causes a
	  bus error. The real issue is that we are working with both a FILE
	  * and the raw fd underneath it and not synchronizing between
	  them. The code that was removed in ASTERISK-15359 was correct,
	  but we weren't flushing the FILE * before mapping the fd. Looking
	  at the manager code in 1.4 reveals that the FILE * in 'struct
	  mansession' is never used except to create a temporary file that
	  we immediately fdopen. This means we just need to write a 0 byte
	  to the fd and everything will just work. The other branches
	  require a call to fflush() which, while not a guaranteed fix,
	  should reduce the likelihood of a crash. This all makes sense in

	  flag instead of RPORT_PRESENT It turned out that this was causing
	  NAT=Yes to always use rport when present which was against 1.6.2
	  behavior and the check itself was redundant since the only way
	  this segment of code could be reached was if RPORT_PRESENT was
	  already evaluated as true earlier. (closes issue ASTERISK-17789)

	  messaging processing engine will not proceed until something else
	  writes data to the socket, which may not occur. This change

	  being set in the general section of voicemail would cause the
	  inbox folder name to change. Since sound file names are made
	  based on the names of the folders, this would cause the audio
	  related to that folder name to change and if Asterisk attempted
	  to play it, the channel would instantly hang up when the audio
	  file couldn't be found. This patch searches for the name of the
	  folder first to leave existing behavior in tact and if that
	  fails, it uses the normal inbox name to get the sound file
	  instead. (closes issue #16104) Reported by: blkline Review:

	  autoservice_stop() return nothing. Also check if the autoservice
	  flag is set before starting or stopping the autoservice and stop
	  and start the autoservice when returning control to and getting
	  control from the pbx engine.

	  driver itself. This implementation is for chan_sip only, but
	  others could be added in the future. (closes issue #17957)

	  | 18 lines Allow transfer loops without allowing forwarding loops
	  We try to avoid the situation where two phones may be forwarded
	  to each other causing an infinite loop by storing each dialed
	  interface in a channel datastore and checking the list before
	  dialing out. This works, but currently breaks situations like A
	  calls B, A transfers B to C, B transfers C to A, and A transfers
	  C to B. Since human interaction is happening here and not an
	  automated forwarding loop, it should be allowed. This patch
	  removes the dialed_interfaces datastore when a call is bridged (a
	  suggestion from the brilliant mmichelson). If a call is being
	  bridged, it should be safe to assume that we aren't stuck in a
	  loop. Since we are now handling this is the bridge code, the
	  previous attempts at handling it in app_dial and app_queue are
	  removed. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1195/

	  do_monitor. Deadlock avoidance between the sip pvt and the

	  this complication is no longer necessary. It turns out the pvt's
	  msg queue only exists because of deadlock avoidance (when
	  deadlock avoidance fails msgs were added to a queue to be
	  processed later), so this goes away as well. The technique used
	  in the new sip_lock_pvt_full() function should be used as a
	  template for replacing all locations where deadlock avoidance
	  occurs between a channel tech_pvt and the pvt's owner. My hope is

	  | 17 lines sip codec negotiation of dynamic rtp payloads error
	  fix This patch fixes how chan_sip handles dynamic rtp payload
	  types it does not understand. At the moment if a dynamic

	  does not get removed from our payload table. As a result of this,
	  the payload is set to whatever dynamic codec we use internally
	  for that payload number on outgoing INVITES. This is incorrect.
	  This patch fixes this by properly checking the rtpmap set

	  can return both -1 and -2 depending on the source of the

	* CREDITS, main/ccss.c, configs/ccss.conf.sample: Add Device State
	  Information CCSS for Generic Devices. Add Asterisk Device State
	  information and callbacks to the Call Completion Supplemental
	  Services for generic agents. There are currently not many devices
	  that have native support for CCSS. Even as the devices become
	  available there may be other reasons why one may choose to not
	  take advantage of the native abilities and stick with the generic
	  implementation. The generic implementation is quite capable and
	  could be greatly enhanced by adding device state capabilities. A
	  phone could then subscribe to the device state with a BLF key in
	  conjunction with Asterisk hints. The advantages of the device
	  state information would allow a single button to: request CCSS,
	  cancel a CCSS request, and display the current state of a CCSS
	  request. For example, you may have a single button that when not
	  lit, there is no active CCSS request. When you press that button,
	  the dialplan can query the DEVICE_STATE() associated with that
	  caller to determine whether they should be calling
	  CallCompletionRequest() or CallCompletionCancel(). If there is
	  currently a pending request, then the dialplan would cancel it.
	  This also has the advantage of showing the true state of a
	  request, which is an asynchronous call, even when
	  CallCompletionRequest() thinks it was successful. The actual
	  request could ultimately fail. Once lit, further feedback can be
	  provided to the caller about the current state of their request
	  since it will be updated by the CCSS State Machine as
	  appropriate. The DEVICE_STATE mapping is configurable since the
	  BLF being used on a given phone type may vary. The idea is to
	  allow some level of customization as to the phone's behavior. As
	  an example, you may want the BLF key to go solid once you have
	  requested a callback. You may then want the LED to blink
	  (typically ringing) when either the callback is in process, which
	  is a visual indication that the incoming call is the desired
	  callback. You may want it to blink when the callee is ready but
	  you are busy, giving you a visual indication that the target is
	  available as you may want to get off the line so that the
	  callback can be successful. Device state information is sent back
	  via the ast_devstate_prov_add() callback for any generic CCSS
	  device as it traverses through the state machine. You simply
	  provide a map between CC_STATE values and the corresponding
	  AST_DEVICE state values. You could then generate hints against
	  these states similar to what is possible today with Custom
	  Devstates or MeetMe states. For example, you may have an
	  extension 3000 that is currently associated with device SIP/3000.
	  You could then create a feature code for that extension that may
	  look something like: exten => *823000,hint,ccss:sip/3000 You
	  would then subscribe a BLF button to *823000 which would point to
	  the dialplan that handled CCSS requests/cancels using the
	  available DEVICE_STATE() information about ccss:sip/3000 to make
	  the decision about what to do. (closes issue #18788) Reported by:

	  | 25 lines Stuck channel using FEATD_MF if caller hangs up at the
	  right time. The cause was actually a caller hanging up just at
	  the end of the Feature Group D DTMF tones that setup the call.
	  The reason for this is a "guard timer" that's implemented using
	  ast_safe_sleep(100). If the caller happens to hang up AFTER the
	  final tone of the DTMF string but BEFORE the end of that
	  ast_safe_sleep(), then ast_safe_sleep() will return non-zero.
	  This causes the code to bounce to the end of ss_thread(), but it
	  does NOT tear down the call properly. This should be a rare
	  occurrence because the caller has to hang up at EXACTLY the right
	  time. Nonetheless, it was happening quite regularly on the
	  reporter's system. It's not easily reproducible, unless you
	  purposely increase the guard-time to 2000 or more. Once you do
	  that, you can reproduce it every time by watching the DTMF debug
	  and hanging up just as it ends. Simply add an ast_hangup() before
	  goto quit. (closes issue #15671) Reported by: jcromes Patches:

	  additional messages while mailbox is open. close_mailbox leave
	  gaps in message sequence if messages are deleted and new messages
	  arrive during this time, this is because the shuffle down to slot

	  re-evaluate number of messages before the shuffle, this then
	  includes new arrivals. Happens on filebased or ODBC storage.

	  feature added. The patch restores the o option behavior and adds
	  the ability to specify the CallerID. The Dial o and f options are
	  complementary to each other. The o option stores the CallerID on
	  the outgoing channel as the channel's CallerID. The f option
	  forces the CallerID sent by the outgoing channel. o(x) - The
	  argument 'x' is optional. If not present, then specify that the
	  CallerID that was present on the *calling* channel be stored as
	  the CallerID on the *called* channel. This was the behavior of
	  Asterisk 1.0 and earlier. If present, then specify the CallerID
	  stored on the *called* channel. Note that o(${CALLERID(all)}) is
	  similar to option o without parameters. f(x) - The argument 'x'
	  is optional and its presence changes the behavior of this option.
	  If not present, then force the outgoing CallerID on a
	  call-forward or deflection to the dialplan extension for this
	  Dial() using a dialplan 'hint'. For example, some PSTNs do not
	  allow CallerID to be set to anything other than the numbers
	  assigned to you. If present, then force the outgoing CallerID to

	  | 29 lines Don't delay DTMF in core bridge while listening for
	  DTMF features This patch is mostly the work of Olle Johansson. I
	  did some cleanup and added the silence generating code if
	  transmit_silence is set. When a channel listens for DTMF in the
	  core bridge, the outbound DTMF is not sent until we have received
	  DTMF_END. For a long DTMF, this is a disaster. We send 4 seconds
	  of DTMF to Asterisk, which sends no audio for those 4 seconds.
	  Some products see this delay and the time skew on RTP packets
	  that results and start ignoring the audio that is sent afterward.
	  With this change, the DTMF_BEGIN frame is inspected and checked.
	  If it matches a feature code, we wait for DTMF_END and activate
	  the feature as before. If transmit_silence=yes in asterisk.conf,
	  silence is sent if we paritally match a multi-digit feature. If
	  it doesn't match a feature, the frame is forwarded along with the
	  DTMF_END without delay. By doing it this way, DTMF is not
	  delayed. (closes issue #15642) Reported by: jasonshugart Patches:

	  | 31 lines Add AELSub, which provides a stable entry point into
	  AEL subroutines. This commit needs some explanation, given that
	  we're adding a new application into an existing release branch.
	  This is generally a violation of our release policy, except in
	  very limited circumstances, and I believe this is one of those
	  circumstances. The problem that this solves is one of the sanity
	  of using multiple dialplan languages to define a dialplan. In the
	  case of the reporter, he or she is using AEL is define
	  subroutines, while using Realtime extensions to invoke those
	  subroutines. While you can do this, it's based upon the reality
	  of AEL using actual dialplan extensions; however, there is no
	  guarantee that the details of _how_ AEL is compiled into
	  extensions will remain stable. In fact, at the time of this
	  commit, it has already changed twice, once in a fundamental way.
	  Now normally, a new application would only be added to trunk.
	  However, this application is explicitly to create a stable
	  user-level API between versions, and adding it to trunk only will
	  not solve the user's problem of switching between 1.6.2 and 1.8,
	  nor will it help anybody switching from 1.8 to 1.10. Therefore,
	  it needs to go into existing release branches. For the sake of
	  consistency, and also because one of the changes was between 1.4
	  and 1.6.x, I am also electing to commit this to 1.4. (closes

	  | 46 lines Get real channel of a DAHDI call. Starting with
	  Asterisk v1.8, the DAHDI channel name format was changed for ISDN
	  calls to: DAHDI/i<span>/<number>[:<subaddress>]-<sequence-number>
	  There were several reasons that the channel name had to change.
	  1) Call completion requires a device state for ISDN phones. The
	  generic device state uses the channel name. 2) Calls do not
	  necessarily have B channels. Calls placed on hold by an ISDN
	  phone do not have B channels. 3) The B channel a call initially
	  requests may not be the B channel the call ultimately uses.
	  Changes to the internal implementation of the Asterisk master
	  channel list caused deadlock problems for chan_dahdi if it needed
	  to change the channel name. Chan_dahdi no longer changes the
	  channel name. 4) DTMF attended transfers now work with ISDN
	  phones because the channel name is "dialable" like the chan_sip
	  channel names. For various reasons, some people need to know
	  which B channel a DAHDI call is using. * Added
	  CHANNEL(dahdi_span), CHANNEL(dahdi_channel), and
	  CHANNEL(dahdi_type) so the dialplan can determine the B channel
	  currently in use by the channel. Use CHANNEL(no_media_path) to
	  determine if the channel even has a B channel. * Added AMI event
	  DAHDIChannel to associate a DAHDI channel with an Asterisk
	  channel so AMI applications can passively determine the B channel
	  currently in use. Calls with "no-media" as the DAHDIChannel do
	  not have an associated B channel. No-media calls are either on

	  Feb 2011) | 37 lines No response sent for SIP CC
	  subscribe/resubscribe request. Asterisk does not send a response
	  if we try to subscribe for call completion after we have received
	  a 180 Ringing. You can only subscribe for call completion when
	  the call has been cleared. When we receive the 180 Ringing, for
	  this call, its call-completion state is 'CC_AVAILABLE'. If we
	  then send a subscribe message to Asterisk, it trys to change the
	  call-completion state to 'CC_CALLER_REQUESTED'. Because this is
	  an invalid state change, it just ignores the message. The only
	  state Asterisk will accept our subscribe message is in the
	  'CC_CALLER_OFFERED' state. Asterisk will go into the
	  'CC_CALLER_OFFERED' when the SIP client clears the call by
	  sending a CANCEL. Asterisk should always send a response. Even if
	  its a negative one. The fix is to allow for the CCSS core to
	  notify a CC agent that a failure has occurred when CC is
	  requested. The "ack" callback is replaced with a "respond"
	  callback. The "respond" callback has a parameter indicating
	  either a successful response or a specific type of failure that
	  may need to be communicated to the requester. (closes issue

	  extension generated by AEL and an "s" extension that was required
	  to exist by the chan_dahdi (or another channel) that was not
	  supplied with a starting extension. Therefore, AEL made incorrect

	  This was fixed by making AEL generate a different extension name.
	  However, Dial and Queue make additional assumptions about the
	  name of the default gosub extension. Therefore, they needed to be
	  brought into line with a "macro" rendered by AEL (as a gosub),

	* res/res_fax.c: Rename the SendFAX/ReceiveFAX 'force audio'
	  option. The recently added option to disable usage of T.38 for a
	  single session should have been named 'F' for 'force audio',
	  since that is really what the user is asking to happen (and it's
	  a positive option instead of a negative option that way).

	* apps/app_followme.c: Add option to followme to delay answer until

	* res/res_fax.c: Add ability to disable T.38 usage for specific
	  SendFAX/ReceiveFAX sessions. Sometimes during troubleshooting it
	  can be useful to disable T.38 usage in order to narrow down a

	  | 16 lines Guard against retransmitting BYEs indefinitely In the
	  case of an attended transfer (A calls B, A atxfers to C) where A
	  becomes unreachable before replying to Asterisk's BYE, Asterisk
	  can sometimes retransmit the BYE indefinitely. This is because
	  __sip_autodestruct tests p->refer && !ast_test_flag(&p->flags[0],
	  SIP_ALREADYGONE and will then transmit a BYE. When this BYE times
	  out, it will not ever be marked as ALREADYGONE, so when
	  __sip_autodestruct is called again, we end up starting the cycle
	  over. This patch adds a call to sip_alreadygone(pkt->owner) in
	  retrans_pkt in the case of a BYE that has timed out. This should
	  prevent Asterisk from trying to transmit new BYE messages in the
	  future. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1077/ ........

	  | 31 lines Fix channel redirect out of MeetMe() and other issues
	  with channel softhangup. Mantis issue #18585 reports that a
	  channel redirect out of MeetMe() stopped working properly. This
	  issue includes a patch that resolves the issue by removing a call
	  to ast_check_hangup() from app_meetme.c. I left that in my patch,
	  as it doesn't need to be there. However, the rest of the patch
	  fixes this problem with or without the change to app_meetme. The
	  key difference between what happens before and after this patch
	  is the effect of the END_OF_Q control frame. After END_OF_Q is
	  hit in ast_read(), ast_read() will return NULL. With the
	  ast_check_hangup() removed, app_meetme sees this which causes it
	  to exit as intended. Checking ast_check_hangup() caused
	  app_meetme to exit earlier in the process, and the target of the
	  redirect saw the condition where ast_read() returned NULL.
	  Removing ast_check_hangup() works around the issue in app_meetme,
	  but doesn't solve the issue if another application did the same
	  thing. There are also other edge cases where if an application
	  finishes at the same time that a redirect happens, the target of
	  the redirect will think that the channel hung up. So, I made some
	  changes in pbx.c to resolve it at a deeper level. There are
	  already places that unset the SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO flag in an
	  attempt to abort the hangup process. My patch extends this to
	  remove the END_OF_Q frame from the channel's read queue, making
	  the "abort hangup" more complete. This same technique was used in
	  every place where a softhangup flag was cleared. (closes issue

	  '\' characters in quoted strings in accordance with section 25.1
	  of RFC 3261. The ast_uri_encode() function has also been modified
	  to take an ast_flags struct describing the set of rules it should
	  use when escaping characters to allow for it to escape SIP URIs
	  in addition to HTTP URIs and other types of URIs or variations of
	  those two URI types in the future. The ast_uri_decode() function
	  has also been modified to accept an ast_flags struct describing
	  the set of rules to use when decoding to enable decoding '+' as '
	  ' in legacy http URLs. The unit tests for these functions have
	  also been updated. ABE-2705 Review:

	  2011-01-19: (02:07:03 PM) boch: i wonder how to cycle all entries
	  in a tree (02:07:11 PM) leifmadsen: use While() (02:07:17 PM)
	  leifmadsen: you need to know the tree structure already though
	  (02:07:36 PM) boch: what you mean? (02:09:02 PM) leifmadsen: you
	  need to know the structure prior to looping, because you can't
	  just return the structure from the dialplan (02:09:43 PM)
	  leifmadsen: the only way I can think of doing that is via
	  something like writing the output of: asterisk -rx "database
	  show" to a file, then looping through that to know the structure
	  of the database and check everything (02:09:59 PM) leifmadsen:
	  but at that point you're better off just using either a
	  relational database or an external script (02:10:13 PM) boch: for
	  example i need to know all entries in the tree (02:10:15 PM)

	  (02:13:09 PM) mateu: yeah, i'm surprised there isn't something

	  keys in a family to loop over. (02:15:35 PM) leifmadsen: database
	  shows everything (02:16:22 PM) mateu: i mean something from the

	  leifmadsen: guess no one has found that important enough to
	  program :) (02:16:52 PM) leifmadsen: at that point you should

	  at least we know how it currently stands. thanks leifmadsen
	  (02:28:52 PM) Corydon76-home: leifmadsen: something like
	  HASHKEYS() ? (02:30:11 PM) leifmadsen: Corydon76-home: ummm, I
	  was thinking more like DUNDI_QUERY() and DUNDI_RESULT() (02:30:31
	  PM) leifmadsen: although HASHKEYS() might work (02:30:58 PM)
	  leifmadsen: actually ya, looking at it, similar to HASHKEYS()
	  (02:31:01 PM) leifmadsen: DBKEYS() I guess? (02:31:45 PM)
	  Corydon76-home: So with no argument, retrieves families, with an
	  argument, retrieves keys of that family? (02:34:02 PM)
	  leifmadsen: ya (02:34:16 PM) leifmadsen: how would you iterate
	  through layers of them? (02:34:30 PM) leifmadsen: i.e.
	  family/key/key/key ? (02:34:43 PM) Corydon76-home: Essentially,
	  yes

	  | 88 lines Issues with DTMF triggered attended transfers. Issue
	  #17999 1) A calls B. B answers. 2) B using DTMF dial *2 (code in
	  features.conf for attended transfer). 3) A hears MOH. B dial
	  number C 4) C ringing. A hears MOH. 5) B hangup. A still hears
	  MOH. C ringing. 6) A hangup. C still ringing until
	  "atxfernoanswertimeout" expires. For v1.4 C will ring forever
	  until C answers the dead line. (Issue #17096) Problem: When A and
	  B hangup, C is still ringing. Issue #18395 SIP call limit of B is
	  1 1. A call B, B answered 2. B *2(atxfer) call C 3. B hangup, C
	  ringing 4. Timeout waiting for C to answer 5. Recall to B fails
	  because B has reached its call limit. Because B reached its call
	  limit, it cannot do anything until the transfer it started
	  completes. Issue #17273 Same scenario as issue 18395 but party B
	  is an FXS port. Party B cannot do anything until the transfer it
	  started completes. If B goes back off hook before C answers, B
	  hears ringback instead of the expected dialtone. ********** Note
	  for the issue #17273 and #18395 fix: DTMF attended transfer works
	  within the channel bridge. Unfortunately, when either party A or
	  B in the channel bridge hangs up, that channel is not completely
	  hung up until the transfer completes. This is a real problem
	  depending upon the channel technology involved. For chan_dahdi,
	  the channel is crippled until the hangup is complete. Either the
	  channel is not useable (analog) or the protocol disconnect
	  messages are held up (PRI/BRI/SS7) and the media is not released.
	  For chan_sip, a call limit of one is going to block that endpoint
	  from any further calls until the hangup is complete. For party A
	  this is a minor problem. The party A channel will only be in this
	  condition while party B is dialing and when party B and C are
	  conferring. The conversation between party B and C is expected to
	  be a short one. Party B is either asking a question of party C or
	  announcing party A. Also party A does not have much incentive to
	  hangup at this point. For party B this can be a major problem
	  during a blonde transfer. (A blonde transfer is our term for an
	  attended transfer that is converted into a blind transfer. :))
	  Party B could be the operator. When party B hangs up, he assumes
	  that he is out of the original call entirely. The party B channel
	  will be in this condition while party C is ringing, while
	  attempting to recall party B, and while waiting between call
	  attempts. WARNING: The ATXFER_NULL_TECH conditional is a hack to
	  fix the problem. It will replace the party B channel technology
	  with a NULL channel driver to complete hanging up the party B
	  channel technology. The consequences of this code is that the 'h'
	  extension will not be able to access any channel technology
	  specific information like SIP statistics for the call.
	  ATXFER_NULL_TECH is not defined by default. ********** (closes

	  pbx_find_extension, which starts and stops autoservice during the
	  lookup. The problem scenario as illustrated by the reporter:

	  handle_incoming handle_request_refer ast_parking_ext_valid
	  pbx_find_extension ast_autoservice_stop while (chan_list_state ==

	  complex (depending on your system) ast_channel_lock(c[x]);
	  handle_request_do and schedule_process_request_queue locks the
	  owner if it exists. The autoservice thread is waiting for the
	  channel lock, which wasn't ever released since the do_monitor
	  thread was waiting for autoservice operations to complete. Solved

	  | 12 lines Fix CPU spike when pressing DTMF after agent login.
	  The problem here is that DTMF was being continuously deferred and
	  requeued since ast_safe_sleep is called in a loop. There are
	  serveral other places in the code that sleeps and then loops in a
	  similar fashion. Because of this fact I opted to not defer DTMF
	  any more, which will not affect the original fix:

	  reworks how this is done and just allows you to optionally start
	  a thread on the original scheduler context structure that has
	  always been there. This makes it trivial to switch to the generic
	  scheduler thread implementation without having to touch any of
	  the other code that adds or removes scheduler entries. In
	  passing, I made some naming tweaks to add ast_ prefixes where
	  they were not there before. Review:

	  | 23 lines Fix not stopping MOH when transfered local channel
	  queue member is answered. The problem here is only present when
	  local channels are used with the MOH passthru option as well as
	  no optimization (/nm). I will describe the slightly bizarre
	  scenario that was used to test, where phones B and C are queue
	  members: Phone A dials into a queue with two members using local
	  channels and the above options. Phone B answers. Phone A blind
	  transfers phone B into the same queue. Phone A hangs up. Phone C
	  answers, but phone B didn't stop playing MOH. In this scenario,
	  the unhold frame that should have gotten to phone B never arrived
	  due to the masquerade from the blind transfer. This is usually
	  fine since app_queue manages the starting and stopping of MOH.
	  However, with the passthrough option enabled when app_queue
	  attempts to stop MOH it tries to do so on the local channel
	  rather than the real channel. The easiest solution was to just
	  make sure to send an unhold frame during the transfer since it
	  wouldn't make sense to have MOH playing after a transfer anyway.
	  This only modifies SIP transfers, but the other transfers did not
	  seem to be a problem. If DTMF based transfers were a problem it
	  might be okay to add ast_moh_stop to finishup, but I didn't want
	  to have to add that unless required. ABE-2624 ........

	  | 43 lines Oneway audio to SIP phone from FXS port after FXS port
	  gets a CallWaiting pip. The FXS connected phone has to have
	  CW/CID support to fail, as it will send back a DTMF 'A' or 'D'
	  when it's ready to receive CallerID. A normal phone with no CID
	  never fails. Also the SIP phone does not hear MOH when the CW
	  call is answered. The DTMF end frame is suppressed when the phone
	  acknowledges the CW signal for CID. The problem is the DTMF begin
	  frame needs to be suppressed as well. The DTMF begin frame is
	  causing SIP to start sending the DTMF RTP frames. Since the DTMF
	  end frame is suppressed, SIP will not stop sending those DTMF RTP
	  packets. * Suppress the DTMF begin and end frames when the
	  channel driver is looking for DTMF digits. * Fixed a couple
	  issues caused by not cleaning up the CID spill if you answer the
	  CW call while it is sending the CID spill. * Fixed not sending
	  CW/CID spill to the phone when the call is natively bridged.
	  (Fixed by not using native bridge if CW/CID is possible.) *
	  Suppress received audio when sending CW/CID spills. The other
	  parties involved do not need to hear the CW/CID spills and may be
	  confused if the CW call is for them. (closes issue #18129)

	  | 38 lines Handle failures building translation paths more
	  effectively. The problem scenario occurred on a heavily loaded
	  system that was using the codec_dahdi module and exceeded the
	  hardware transcoding capacity. The failure mode at that point was
	  not good. The report came in to us as an Asterisk lock-up. The
	  "core show locks" shows a ton of threads locked up (but no
	  obvious deadlock). Upon deeper investigation, when the system is
	  in this state, the CPU was maxed out. The CPU was being consumed
	  by the Asterisk logger spewing messages on every audio frame for
	  calls set up after transcoder capacity was reached. The purpose
	  of this patch is to make Asterisk handle failures to create a
	  translation path in a more graceful manner. If we can't
	  translate, then the call just needs to be dropped, as it's not
	  going to work. These are the changes: 1) In set_format() of
	  channel.c (which is called by set_read_format() and
	  set_write_format()), it was ignoring if
	  ast_translator_build_path() failed and returned NULL. It now pays
	  attention to that case and returns a result reflecting failure.
	  With this change in place, the bridging code will immediately
	  detect a failure and end the bridge instead of proceeding to try
	  to bridge frames that can't be translated and making channel
	  drivers freak out by sending them frames in a format they weren't
	  expecting. 2) In ast_indicate_data() of channel.c, failure of
	  ast_playtones_start() was ignored. It is now reflected in the
	  return value of the function. This didn't turn out to have any
	  affect on the bug, but seemed like a good change to leave in. 3)
	  In app_dial(), when only sending a call to a single endpoint, it
	  will attempt to do some bridging of its own of early audio. It
	  uses make_compatible() when it's going to do this. However, it
	  ignored failure from make compatible. So, even with the fix from
	  #1, if there was early audio going through app_dial, there would
	  still be a period of invalid frames passing through. After
	  detecting failure here, Dial() exits. ABE-2658 ........

	  | 46 lines The channel redirect function (CLI or AMI) hangs up
	  the call instead of redirecting the call. To recreate the
	  problem: 1) Party A calls Party B 2) Invoke CLI "channel
	  redirect" command to redirect channel call leg associated with A.
	  3) All associated channels are hung up. Note that if the CLI
	  command were done on the channel call leg associated with B it
	  works. This regression was a result of the fix for issue #16946
	  (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/740/). The regression affects
	  all features that use an async goto to execute the dialplan
	  because of an external event: Channel redirect, AMI redirect, SIP
	  REFER, and FAX detection. The struct ast_channel._softhangup code
	  is a mess. The variable is used for several purposes that do not
	  necessarily result in the call being hung up. I have added
	  doxygen comments to describe how the various _softhangup bits are
	  used. I have corrected all the places where the variable was
	  tested in a non-bit oriented manner. The primary fix is the new
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q frame. It acts as a weak hangup request so
	  the soft hangup requests that do not normally result in a hangup
	  do not hangup. JIRA SWP-2470 JIRA SWP-2489 (closes issue #18171)

	  | 29 lines Fix cache of device state changes for multiple
	  servers. This patch addresses a regression where device states
	  across multiple servers were not being processing completely
	  correctly. The code works to determine the overall state by
	  looking at the last known state of a device on each server.
	  However, there was a regression due to some invasive rewrites of
	  how the cache works that led to the cache only storing the last
	  device state change for a device, regardless of which server it
	  was on. The code is set up to cache device state change events by
	  ensuring that each event in the cache has a unique device name +
	  entity ID (server ID). The code that was responsible for
	  comparing raw information elements (which EID is) always returned
	  a match due to a memcmp() with a length of 0. There isn't much
	  code to fix the actual bug. This patch also introduces a new CLI
	  command that was very useful for debugging this problem. The
	  command allows you to dump the contents of the event cache.

	  peers never stopping. The option packets not only never stopped,
	  but if a realtime peer was not in the peer list multiple options
	  dialogs could accumulate over time. This scenario has the
	  potential to progress to the point of saturating a link just from
	  options packets. The fix was to ensure that the poke scheduler
	  checks to see if a peer is in the peer list before continuing to
	  poke. The reason a peer must be in the peer list to be able to
	  properly manage an options dialog is because otherwise the call
	  pointer is lost when the peer is regenerated from the database,
	  which is how existing qualify dialogs are detected. (closes issue

	  during a mISDN hangup collision. Bad things have been happening
	  in chan_misdn because the chan_misdn channel private struct
	  chan_list is not protected from reentrancy. Hangup collisions
	  have be causing read and write accesses to freed memory.
	  Converted chan_misdn struct chan_list to an ao2 object for its
	  reference counting feature. ********** Removed an impediment to
	  converting chan_list to an ao2 object. The use of the other_ch
	  member in chan_list is shaky at best. It is set if the incoming
	  and outgoing call legs are mISDN. The use of the other_ch member
	  goes against the Asterisk architecture and can even cause
	  problems. 1) It is used to disable echo cancellation. This could
	  be bad if the call is forked and the winning call leg is not
	  mISDN or the winning call leg is not the last mISDN channel
	  called by the fork. The other_ch would become a dangling pointer.
	  2) It is used when the far end is alerting to hear the far end's
	  inband audio instead of Asterisk's generated ringback tone. This
	  is bad if the call is forked. You would only hear the last forked
	  mISDN channel and it may not be ringing yet. The other_ch would
	  become a dangling pointer if the call is later transferred.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Perform proper handling of forked outbound
	  INVITE requests. RFC3261 section 12 about dialog creation says an
	  INVITE transaction results in an established dialog once it
	  receives the 200 OK response. It is possible to receive multiple
	  differing 200 OK responses for a single outbound INVITE Request,
	  and this should result in establishing multiple dialogs. This
	  patch allows for all differing 200 OK responses to an INVITE
	  request to establish a separate dialog, but only the first dialog
	  is kept. All other resulting dialogs from the initial request are
	  immediately ACKed and then immediately terminated with a BYE
	  request. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/946/

	  receiving unexpected frame sizes. dahdi-linux 2.4.0 (specifically
	  commit 9034) added the capability for the wctc4xxp to return more
	  than a single packet of data in response to a read. However, when
	  decoding packets, codec_dahdi was still assuming that the default
	  number of samples was in each read. In other words, each packet
	  your provider sent you, regardless of size, would result in 20 ms
	  of decoded data (30 ms if decoding G723). If your provider was
	  sending 60 ms packets then codec_dahdi would end up stripping 40
	  ms of data from each transcoded frame resulting in "choppy"
	  audio. This would only affect systems where G729 packets are
	  arriving in sizes greater than 20ms or G723 packets arriving in
	  sizes greater than 30ms. DAHDI-744. ........ ................

	  | 25 lines Avoid valgrind warnings for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_xxx_address The documentation for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_(local/remote)_address stated that they
	  returned 0 for success and -1 on failure. Instead, they returned
	  0 if the address structure passed in was already equivalent to
	  the address instance local/remote address or 1 otherwise. 90% of
	  the calls to these functions completely ignored the return
	  address and passed in an uninitialized struct, which would make
	  valgrind complain even though the operation was technically safe.
	  This patch fixes the documentation and converts the
	  get_xxx_address functions to void since all they really do is
	  copy the address and cannot fail. Additionally two new functions
	  (ast_rtp_instance_get_and_cmp_(local/remote)_address) are created
	  for the 3 times where the return value was actually checked. The
	  get_and_cmp_local_address function is currently unused, but
	  exists for the sake of symmetry. The only functional change as a
	  result of this change is that we will not do an
	  ast_sockaddr_cmp() on (mostly uninitialized) addresses before
	  doing the ast_sockaddr_copy() in the get_*_address functions. So,
	  even though it is an API change, it shouldn't have a noticeable
	  change in behavior. Review:

	  | 29 lines Fix inprocess_container in voicemail to correctly
	  restrict max messages. The comparison function logic was off, so
	  the number of sessions for a given mailbox were not being
	  incremented properly. This problem caused the maximum number of
	  messages per folder to not be respected when simultaneously
	  leaving multiple voicemails just below the threshold. These
	  problems should be fixed by the above, but just in case: Fixed
	  resequence_mailbox to rely on the actual number of detected
	  number of files in a directory rather than just assuming only 10
	  messages more than the maximum had been left. Also if more
	  messages than the maximum are deleted they are actually removed
	  now. The second purpose of this commit should have been separated
	  out probably, but is related to the above. Again, if the number
	  of messages in a given voicemail folder exceeds the maximum set
	  limit make sure to allocate enough space for the deleted and
	  heard index tracking array. A few random fixes: There was a
	  forgotten decrement of the inprocess count in imap_store_file.
	  When using IMAP storage, do not look in the directory where file
	  based storage messages may still reside and influence the message
	  count. Ensure to use only the first format in sendmail. ABE-2516

	  | 27 lines This patch turns chan_local pvts into astobj2 objects.
	  chan_local does some dangerous things involving deadlock
	  avoidance. tech_pvt functions like hangup and queue_frame are
	  provided with a locked channel upon entry. Those functions are
	  completely safe as long as you don't attempt to give up that
	  channel lock, but that is impossible to guarantee due to the
	  required deadlock avoidance necessary to lock both the tech_pvt
	  and both channels involved. In the past, we have tried to account
	  for this by doing things like setting a "glare" flag that
	  indicates what function should destroy the pvt. This was used in
	  local_hangup and local_queue_frame to decided who should destroy
	  the pvt if they collided in separate threads. I have removed the
	  need to do this by converting all chan_local tech_pvts to
	  astobj2. This means we can ref a pvt before deadlock avoidance
	  and not have to worry about that pvt possibly getting destroyed
	  under us. It also cleans up where we destroy the tech_pvt. The
	  only unlink from the tech_pvt container occurs in local_hangup
	  now, which is where it should occur. Since there still may be
	  thread collisions on some functions like local_hangup after
	  deadlock avoidance, I have added some checks to detect those
	  collisions and exit appropriately. I think this patch is going to
	  solve quite a bit of weirdness we have had with local channels in
	  the past. ........ ................ ................

	  | 45 lines Add TLS cert helper script This script is useful for
	  quickly generating self-signed CA, server, and client
	  certificates for use with Asterisk. It is still recommended to
	  obtain certificates from a recognized Certificate Authority and
	  to develop an understanding how SSL certificates work. Real
	  security is hard work. OPTIONS: -h Show this message -m Type of
	  cert "client" or "server". Defaults to server. -f Config filename
	  (openssl config file format) -c CA cert filename (creates new CA
	  cert/key as ca.crt/ca.key if not passed) -k CA key filename -C
	  Common name (cert field) For a server cert, this should be the
	  same address that clients attempt to connect to. Usually this
	  will be the Fully Qualified Domain Name, but might be the IP of
	  the server. For a CA or client cert, it is merely informational.
	  Make sure your certs have unique common names. -O Org name (cert
	  field) An informational string (company name) -o Output filename
	  base (defaults to asterisk) -d Output directory (defaults to the
	  current directory) Example: To create a CA and a server
	  (pbx.mycompany.com) cert with output in /tmp: ast_tls_cert -C
	  pbx.mycompany.com -O "My Company" -d /tmp This will create a CA
	  cert and key as well as asterisk.pem and the the two files that
	  it is made from: asterisk.crt and asterisk.key. Copy asterisk.pem
	  and ca.crt somewhere (like /etc/asterisk) and set
	  tlscertfile=/etc/asterisk.pem and tlscafile=/etc/ca.crt. Since
	  this is a self-signed key, many devices will require you to
	  import the ca.crt file as a trusted cert. To create a client cert
	  using the CA cert created by the example above: ast_tls_cert -m
	  client -c /tmp/ca.crt -k /tmp/ca.key -C "Joe User" -O \ "My
	  Company" -d /tmp -o joe_user This will create client.crt/key/pem
	  in /tmp. Use this if your device supports a client certificate.
	  Make sure that you have the ca.crt file set up as a tlscafile in
	  the necessary Asterisk configs. Make backups of all .key files in
	  case you need them later. ........

	  softhangup'd When an outgoing call is answered and hung up by the
	  far end *very* quickly, we may not read any frames and therefor
	  end up with a call that displays the wrong
	  disposition/DIALSTATUS. The reason is because ast_queue_hangup()
	  immediately sets the _softhangup flag on the channel and then
	  queues the HANGUP control frame, but __ast_read refuses to read
	  any frames if ast_check_hangup() indicates that a hangup request
	  has been made (which it will if _softhangup is set). So, we end
	  up losing control frames. This change makes __ast_read continue
	  to read frames even if a soft hangup has been requested. It
	  queues a hangup frame to make sure that __ast_read() will still
	  eventually return NULL. Much thanks to David Vossel for all of

	  patch includes several chan_gtalk enhancements. Two new
	  gtalk.conf options have been added, externip and stunadd. Setting
	  externip allows us to manually specify what the external IP
	  address is outside of a NAT environment. Setting the stunaddr
	  option to a valid stun server allows for that external ip to be
	  retrieved via a STUN server automatically. This external IP is
	  then advertised during call setup as a possible candidate. I have
	  also attempted to clean up chan_gtalk's code so it meets our
	  coding guidelines. During this cleanup I noticed several things
	  that need to be done in the code and made a TODO section at the
	  top of the file. ........

	  Outbound DTMF with gtalk needs to be done within the RTP stream.
	  I discovered this after investigating a packet capture from the
	  gmail client. Instead of performing jingle signaling DTMF, the
	  gtalk servers expect all DTMF to arrive on the RTP stream using
	  RFC2833 way of doing things. Chan_gtalk also had an issue with
	  negotiating RTP payload type 106 for the telephony-event and then
	  sending DTMF as payload 101. This has been resolved by always
	  negotiating 101 as the payload type like we do everywhere else.
	  With this patch, incoming google voice calls forwarded to
	  Asterisk via gtalk work. ........

	  | 15 lines Change RFC2833 DTMF event duration on end to report
	  actual elapsed time. The scenario here is with a non P2P early
	  media session. The reported time length of DTMF presses are
	  coming up short when sending to the remote side. Currently the
	  event duration is a running total that is incremented when
	  sending continuation packets. These continuation packets are only
	  triggered upon incoming media from the remote side, which means
	  that the running total probably is not going to end up matching
	  the actual length of time Asterisk received DTMF. This patch
	  changes the end event duration to be lengthened if it is detected
	  that the end event is going to come up short. Review:

	  ast_bridged_channel() on an unlocked channel. Near the beginning
	  of schedule_delivery(), ast_bridged_channel() is called on
	  iaxs[fr->callno]->owner. However, the channel is not locked,
	  which can result in ast_bridged_channel() crashing should
	  owner->tech change to a technology that doesn't implement
	  bridged_channel. I also fixed the other calls to

	  held there either. Converted the existing channel deadlock
	  avoidance to use iax2_lock_owner(). Using the new function

	  | 21 lines Addition of the FrameHook API (AKA AwesomeHooks) So
	  far all our tools for viewing and manipulating media streams
	  within Asterisk have been entirely focused on audio. That made
	  sense then, but is not scalable now. The FrameHook API lets us
	  tap into and manipulate _ANY_ type of media or signaling passed
	  on a channel present today or in the future. This tool is a step
	  in the direction of expanding Asterisk's boundaries and will help
	  generate some rather interesting applications in the future. In
	  addition to the FrameHook API, a simple dialplan function
	  exercising the api has been included as well. This function is
	  called FRAME_TRACE(). FRAME_TRACE() allows for the internal
	  ast_frames read and written to a channel to be output. Filters
	  can be placed on this function to debug only certain types of
	  frames. This function could be thought of as an internal way of
	  doing ast_frame packet captures. Review:

	  implementation in the current Asterisk mISDN channel
	  unfortunately can handle these information elements only in a
	  NOTIFY message. These information elements are also signaled in a
	  FACILTY message with a RequestSubaddress facility, when the
	  subscriber is already in the active state (see 9.2.4 and 9.2.5 of

	  | 54 lines Fixes interoperability problems with session timer
	  behavior in Asterisk. CHANGES: 1. Never put "timer" in "Require"
	  header. This is not to our benefit and RFC 4028 section 7.1 even
	  warns against it. It is possible for one endpoint to perform
	  session-timer refreshes while the other endpoint does not support
	  them. If in this case the end point performing the refreshing
	  puts "timer" in the Require field during a refresh, the dialog
	  will likely get terminated by the other end. 2. Change the
	  behavior of 'session-timer=accept' in sip.conf (which is the
	  default behavior of Asterisk with no session timer configuration
	  specified) to only run session-timers as result of an incoming
	  INVITE request if the INVITE contains an "Session-Expires"
	  header... Asterisk is currently treating having the "timer"
	  option in the "Supported" header as a request for session timers
	  by the UAC. I do not agree with this. Session timers should only
	  be negotiated in "accept" mode when the incoming INVITE supplies
	  a "Session-Expires" header, otherwise RFC 4028 says we should
	  treat a request containing no "Session-Expires" header as a
	  session with no expiration. Below I have outlined some situations
	  and what Asterisk's behavior is. The table reflects the behavior
	  changes implemented by this patch. SITUATIONS: -Asterisk as UAS
	  1. Incoming INVITE: NO "Session-Expires" 2. Incoming INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires" -Asterisk as UAC 3. Outgoing INVITE: NO
	  "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response HAS "Session-Expires" header
	  4. Outgoing INVITE: NO "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response NO
	  "Session-Expires" header 5. Outgoing INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires". Active - Asterisk will have an active refresh
	  timer regardless if the other endpoint does. Inactive - Asterisk
	  does not have an active refresh timer regardless if the other
	  endpoint does. XXXXXXX - Not possible for mode.

	  | 19 lines Fixed how Asterisk destroys a dialog on channel hangup
	  before invite receives a response. If an ast_channel with a SIP
	  tech pvt hangs up before the sip dialog gets a response to its
	  outgoing INVITE, Asterisk used to pretend_ack the INVITE. This is
	  not rfc compliant and results in confusion at the other endpoint.
	  sip_pretend_ack will ack and remove all the packets in the
	  retransmit queue. This means that the INVITE will stop
	  retransmitting, and that any response to that INVITE that comes
	  after the pretend_ack occurs will be ignored. Instead of faking
	  any sort of acknowledgement for an outgoing INVITE during an
	  internal hangup, we should let the protocol stack process the
	  INVITE transaction and terminate the dialog properly. This is
	  achieved by setting the PENDING_BYE flag. When this flag is used,
	  once the dialog proceeds to an escapable state the transaction
	  will either be canceled with a SIP_CANCEL or completed followed
	  immediately by a BYE. Attempting to do this any other way is
	  incorrect. If the endpoint is not responding to the INVITE
	  request, the INVITE must continue to be retransmitted until it
	  times out which will result in the dialog being destroyed.

	  | 11 lines This fix makes sure the ast_channel hangs up correctly
	  when the dialog's PENDING_BYE flag is set. When the pending bye
	  flag is used, it is possible that the dialog will terminate and
	  leave the sip_pvt->owner channel up. This is because we never
	  hangup the ast_channel after sending the SIP_BYE request. When we
	  receive the response for the SIP_BYE we set need_destroy which we
	  would expect to destroy the dialog on the next do_monitor loop,
	  but this is not the case. The dialog will only be destroyed once
	  the owner is hungup even with the need_destroy flag set. This
	  patch sets the softhangup flag on the ast_channel when a SIP_BYE
	  request is sent as a result of the pending bye flag. ........

	  | 35 lines improved translation paths for wideband codecs The
	  problem I'm addressing is that Asterisk's current method of
	  building the least cost translation paths between codecs does not
	  take into account sample rate. For instance, it was possible for
	  siren14 (a 32khz codec), to contain the a translation path to
	  siren7 (a 16khz audio codec) that goes through slin at 8khz. In
	  this case Asterisk takes a 32khz codec, down samples it to 8khz
	  and then up samples it to 16khz which is terrible regardless if
	  it is computationally less expensive. This patch now builds
	  translation paths that give priority to maintaining the best
	  possible sample rate before taking into consideration
	  computational cost. This patch also adds cli commands to expose
	  what translation paths are actually being used. Changes: 1.
	  Translation paths will never contain a step that changes the
	  sample rate unless absolutely necessary. 2. When choosing the
	  best codec to make two channels compatible. Shared codecs with
	  the highest sample rate are given priority. 3. A new cli command
	  to show all translation paths available for a specific codec
	  'core show translation paths [codec name]' has been added. 4.
	  'core show translation' which displays the translation matrix now
	  includes the new higher bit audio codecs in the table. 5. 'core
	  show channel [channel name]' now displays the translation paths
	  if translation is used. (closes issue #16841) Reported by:

	  | 19 lines remove empty audiohook write list on channel If a

	  | 12 lines Fix inband DTMF detection on outgoing ISDN calls. This
	  is a regression from the sig_pri split from chan_dahdi. When a
	  call is first initiated, the inband DTMF detector is not enabled
	  if it's an outgoing ISDN call. However, it needs to be turned on
	  once the media path starts up. This handling was put back in the
	  open_media() callback of chan_dahdi. In sig_pri, open_media()
	  calls were added to a few places where it was needed, including
	  handling of PRI_EVENT_RINGING, PRI_EVENT_PROGRESS, and
	  PRI_EVENT_PROCEEDING. Thanks to rmudgett for helping me with the
	  patch! ........

	  | 21 lines transaction matching using top most Via header This
	  patch modifies the way chan_sip.c does transaction to dialog
	  matching. Asterisk now stores information in the top most Via
	  header of the initial incoming request and compares that against
	  other Requests that have the same call-id. This results in
	  Asterisk being able to detect a forked call in which it has
	  received multiple legs of the fork. I completely stripped out the
	  previous matching code and made the comparisons a little more
	  explicit and easier to understand. My comments in the code should
	  offer all the details involving this patch. This patch also fixes
	  a bug with the usage of the OBJ-MULTIPLE flag to find multiple
	  dialogs with the same call-id. Since the callback function was
	  returning (CMP_MATCH | CMP_STOP) only the first item found was
	  being returned. I fixed this by making a new callback function
	  for finding multiple dialogs that only returns (CMP_MATCH) on a
	  match allowing for multiple items to be returned. Review:
