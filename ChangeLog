	* AST-2014-011: Fix POODLE security issues

	  There are two aspects to the vulnerability:
	  (1) res_jabber/res_xmpp use SSLv3 only. This patch updates the module
	      to use TLSv1+. At this time, it does not refactor res_jabber/
	      res_xmpp to use the TCP/TLS core, which should be done as an
	      improvement at a latter date.
	  (2) The TCP/TLS core, when tlsclientmethod/sslclientmethod is left
	      unspecified, will default to the OpenSSL SSLv23_method. This
	      method allows for all encryption methods, including SSLv2/SSLv3.
	      A MITM can exploit this by forcing a fallback to SSLv3, which
	      leaves the server vulnerable to POODLE. This patch adds WARNINGS
	      if a user uses SSLv2/SSLv3 in their configuration, and explicitly
	      disables SSLv2/SSLv3 if using SSLv23_method.

	  For TLS clients, Asterisk will default to TLSv1+ and WARN if SSLv2 or
	  SSLv3 is explicitly chosen. For TLS servers, Asterisk will no longer
	  support SSLv2 or SSLv3.

	  Much thanks to abelbeck for reporting the vulnerability and providing
	  a patch for the res_jabber/res_xmpp modules.

	* main/channel.c: Bridging: Fix bouncing native bridge This fixes a
	  situation in Asterisk 1.8 and 11 where ast_channel_bridge could
	  cause a bouncing native bridge. In the case of the
	  dial_LS_options test, this was a remote RTP bridge which caused
	  the audio path to continually cycle between Asterisk and the
	  remote endpoints generating a large number of SIP messages and
	  delaying the test long enough to cause it to fail (checking
	  timing was part of the test). The root cause was that the code to
	  decide whether to use native bridging was expecting a
	  time-remaining value of 0 to be the default instead of the actual
	  default value of -1. A value of 0 or negative numbers could also
	  be generated by preceding code in some circumstances. Both issues
	  are addressed in this patch. ASTERISK-24211 #close Reported by:

	* pbx/pbx_lua.c, main/pbx.c: pbx_lua: fix regression with global
	  sym export and context clash by pbx_config. ASTERISK-23818 (lua
	  contexts being overwritten by contexts of the same name in
	  pbx_config) surfaced because pbx_lua, having the
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS set, was always force loaded before
	  pbx_config. Since I couldn't find any reason for pbx_lua to
	  export it's symbols to the rest of Asterisk, I simply changed the
	  flag to AST_MODFLAG_DEFAULT. Problem solved. What I didn't
	  realize was that the symbols need to be exported not because
	  Asterisk needs them but because any external Lua modules like
	  luasql.mysql need the base Lua language APIs exported
	  (ASTERISK-17279). Back to ASTERISK-23818... It looks like there's
	  an issue in pbx.c where context_merge was only merging includes,
	  switches and ignore patterns if the context was already existing
	  AND has extensions, or if the context was brand new. If pbx_lua
	  is loaded before pbx_config, the context will exist BUT pbx_lua,
	  being implemented as a switch, will never place extensions in it,
	  just the switch statement. The result is that when pbx_config
	  loads, it never merges the switch statement created by pbx_lua
	  into the final context. This patch sets pbx_lua's modflag back to
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS and adds an "else if" in context_merge
	  that catches the case where an existing context has includes,
	  switchs or ingore patterns but no actual extensions.

	* main/utils.c: main/untils: Prevent potential infinite loop in
	  ast_careful_fwrite A loop in ast_careful_fwrite exists that will
	  continually attempt to write to a file stream, even in the
	  presence of EAGAIN/EINTR errors. However, if a connection that
	  uses ast_careful_fwrite closes suddenly, ast_careful_fwrite's
	  call to fflush may return EAGAIN/EINTER along with EOF. A
	  subsequent call to fflush will return EOF but not clear errno,
	  resulting in an infinite loop. This patch clears errno after it
	  is detected and handled the loop, such that any subsequent call
	  to fflush will not get erroneously stuck. Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: be more tolerant of whitespace
	  between attributes in SDP fmtp line This patch is essentially a
	  backport of a small portion of r397526 from ASTERISK-21981. In
	  that patch, pass through support and format attribute negotiation
	  was added for Opus. Part of that included being more tolerant to
	  whitespace in the fmtp line of an SDP; that part of the patch is
	  being applied here. As the author of the backport pointed out, in
	  SDP, the fmtp line is allowed to include whitespace between
	  attributes. RFC 3267 chapter 8.3 (from 2001) includes an example
	  for this. This was not removed in the updated RFC 4867 in 2007.
	  Note that this patch only applies to audio in Asterisk 1.8, which
	  is a bit more limited in its support for format attributes. It
	  does have limited support for some codecs, so this patch is still
	  useful in this version. Review:

	  can now handle SSL certificate renegotiations in the middle of a

	  by the OpenSSL documentation. * Fixed an off nominal leak of the
	  ssl struct in handle_tcptls_connection() if the FILE stream
	  failed to open and the SSL certificate negotiations failed. The
	  patch creates a custom FILE stream handler to give the created
	  FILE streams inactivity timeout and timeout after a specific
	  moment in time capability. This approach eliminates the need for
	  code using the FILE stream to be redesigned to deal with the
	  timeouts. This patch indirectly fixes most of ASTERISK-18345 by

	  The incorrect test that ASTERISK-23383 fixed actually reenabled

	  without restructuring the cache to determine if any files are
	  missing from the last files actually loaded. Also without
	  refactoring config_text_file_load(), the glob loop couldn't check

	  timestamp or it is no longer a regular file. This fixes the
	  corner case where the file was loaded, then deleted, then the
	  config reloaded, then the file restored with the same timestamp,
	  and then the config reloaded again. * Made remove the cache entry

	* channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Start session timer at 200, not at

	  while the other end correctly started at 200. This meant that for
	  short session-expiries (90 seconds) combined with long ringing
	  times (e.g. 30 seconds), asterisk would wrongly assume that the
	  timer was hit before the other end thought it was time to send a
	  session refresh. This resulted in prematurely ended calls. This
	  changes the session timer to start counting first at 200 like RFC
	  says it should. (Also removed a few excess NULL checks that would
	  never hit, because if they did, asterisk would have crashed

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: res_config_odbc: Fix old and new
	  ast_string_field memory leaks. The ODBC realtime driver uses ^NN
	  parameter encoding to cope with the special meaning of the
	  semi-colon. A semi-colon in a field is interpreted as if the key
	  was supplied twice, something which isn't otherwise possible with
	  fixed database columns. E.g. allow=alaw;ulaw is parsed as
	  allow=alaw and allow=ulaw. A literal semi-colon is rewritten to
	  ^3B when stored in the database. The module uses a stringfield to
	  efficiently store the encoded parameters. However, this
	  stringfield wasn't always freed in some off-nominal cases. Commit
	  r413241 fixed initialization so the encoding for INSERT and
	  DELETE queries wouldn't crash. (Only SELECTs and UPDATEs worked
	  apparently.) But that commit forgot the frees. This change cleans
	  that up. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3555/

	  PROGRESS events when overlap dialing is enabled. When overlap
	  dialing is enabled, the lack of inband audio available
	  information in the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE events causes an
	  interoperability problem with SIP. sig_pri doesn't know if there
	  is dialtone present when a SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE is received so it
	  assumes it is there and posts an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame. The
	  SIP channel driver then sends out a 183 Session Progress and
	  blocks the desired 180 Ringing message when the ALERTING message
	  comes in. * Made the configure script detect if the installed
	  version of libpri supports the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE enhancements. *
	  Using the new API, made generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame on
	  an incoming SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message when the message indicates
	  inband audio is present instead of assuming that dialtone is
	  present. * Using the new API, made SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE send out an
	  inband audio available indication only if dialtone is expected.
	  The change also makes the fallback behaviour of sending the
	  PROGRESS message better by sending it only if dialtone is
	  expected. * Changed receiving a PROCEEDING message to not
	  generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame if the progress indication
	  ie indicates non-end-to-end-ISDN. This helps interoperability
	  with SIP. * Changed sending a PROCEEDING message in response to
	  an AST_CONTROL_PROCEEDING frame to not indicate inband audio
	  available. It was silly to do so anyway because the channel
	  driver doesn't know if inband audio is even available. This helps
	  interoperability with SIP. This patch and a corresponding change
	  in libpri work together to allow Asterisk to control the inband
	  audio available progress indication ie on the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE

	  Returning 0 when more than 0 rows were inserted causes problems
	  to the function's callers. To give an idea of how strange code
	  can be, this is the necessary code change to fix a device state
	  issue reported against chan_pjsip in Asterisk 12+. The issue was
	  that the registrar would attempt to insert contacts into the
	  database. Because of the 0 return from res_config_pgsql, the
	  registrar would think that the contact was not successfully
	  inserted, even though it actually was. As such, even though the
	  contact was query-able and it was possible to call the endpoint,
	  Asterisk would "think" the endpoint was unregistered, meaning it
	  would report the device state as UNAVAILABLE instead of
	  NOT_INUSE. The necessary fix applies to all versions of Asterisk,
	  so even though the bug reported only applies to Asterisk 12+, the
	  code correction is being inserted into 1.8+. Closes issue

	  and simply not send the PAI/RPID headers at all if set to 'no'.
	  By default trust_id_outbound will be set to 'legacy' which will
	  preserve the behavior prior to these patches. Extra special

	  longer open/close the file on each write, instead relying on

	  internal_timing: Remove the option and always make it enabled if
	  a timing module is loaded. The masquerade supertest frequently
	  fails because either the local channel chain doesn't completely
	  optimize out or the DTMF handshake doesn't completely get
	  accross. Local channel optimization requires frames flowing to
	  trigger when optimization can happen. When optimization happens
	  the media frame that triggered the optimization is dropped.
	  Sending DTMF requires frames to flow in the other direction for
	  timing purposes while sending nothing. If internal timing is not
	  enabled when MOH is playing, Asterisk switches to received timing
	  when an audio frame is received. With optimization dropping media
	  frames and MOH not sending frames unless it receives frames,
	  occasionaly there are no more frames being passed and the test
	  fails. * The asterisk command line -I option and the
	  asterisk.conf internal_timing option are removed. Asterisk now
	  always uses internal timing when needed if any timing module is
	  loaded. The issue ASTERISK-14861 did this quite awhile ago in
	  v1.4 but effectively is broken if other internal timing modules
	  besides DAHDI are used. The ast_read_generator_actions() now only
	  does received timing if it has no choice for frame generators
	  like MOH, silence, and playback streaming. * Cleaned up some code

	* chan_sip: Add sendrpid trust options

	  In r411189, some behavior was changed which made sendrpid behavior
	  act in a more trusting manner by sending full user data for peers
	  set with private caller presence in P-Asserted-Identity headers.
	  Since this changed long time expected behaviors, we decided to pull
	  that patch when that was pointed out by the community. Instead, this
	  patch provides a trust_id_outbound setting which will expose the data
	  per RFC-3325 if set to 'yes' and simply not send the PAI/RPID headers
	  at all if set to 'no'. By default trust_id_outbound will be set to
	  'legacy' which will preserve the behavior prior to these patches.
	  Extra special thanks to Walter Doekes for providing advice and
	  feedback.

	  request comes from node.js user agent "Shred" via use of
	  swagger-client library. b) Asterisk and Client are *not* on the
	  same host or TCP/IP stack In testing this problem, it has been
	  determined that the write of the HTTP body is lost, even if the
	  data is written using low level write function. The only solution

	  flush the last write and finish the transmission. See review for

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: moh: fix a refcount error with realtime
	  MOH I observed a crash in res_musiconhold on an Asterisk 11
	  system using realtime MOH. Investigation of the backtrace showed
	  a corrupt mohclass, implying that it got destroyed before the
	  code expected it to. I went looking for reference counting errors
	  that could have caused this crash and this patch this result. It
	  contains 2 changes. 1) Remove a usless block of code that was
	  impossible to reach. There was even a comment indicating that it
	  was impossible to reach. The conditional includes
	  "!ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)" and it's
	  inside of an if block with the opposite check
	  "ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)". There's no
	  good reason to keep it around. 2) A similar block to #1 contained
	  a reference counting error. It stores state->class in the local
	  variable mohclass without increasing its reference count. The
	  reference count on mohclass is decremented at the end of the
	  function. This block of code probably very rarely runs, which
	  would help explain why this system was working fine for many
	  months before experiencing a crash. Review:

	* include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h, main/rtp_engine.c: rtp_engine: fix
	  crash during remote native bridging when calling get_codecs When
	  two RTP channels are in a remote bridge, the remote bridging loop
	  in rtp_engine will periodically check to see if the two channels
	  can still be bridged. One of the many things it checks is whether
	  or not the codecs have changed on the channel. If the codec has
	  changed, it will break out of the loop to re-determine which type
	  of bridge is appropriate. In order to perform this check, the
	  ast_rtp_glue virtual table's get_codec callback is called for
	  each channel. The callback implementations assume that the
	  channel tech private is valid when called; as such, there has
	  always been some code in place to check whether or not the
	  channel pvt is NULL before calling. However, this check is
	  insufficient. The channels are unlocked during the remote
	  bridging loop. It is possible for a channel to get masqueraded
	  between the check for the pvt being NULL and the actual call to
	  get_codec. When this occurs, the callback is called with a ZOMBIE
	  channel, which now has a NULL pvt. Crash. While this has always
	  been possible in Asterisk 1.8, it is much more likely to occur in
	  Asterisk 11 and later versions due to the timing changes that
	  occur when getting the codec from a channel. Note that this is
	  much more likely to be reproduced on slow, boggy hardware running
	  Asterisk 11 - but fairly rarely otherwise. Also Note: This crash
	  was also caught by the various SIP blind transfer tests, in
	  addition to the bug report Alec filed. Review:

	  then Bob begins the attended transfer process into a queue. Upon
	  going on hold Alice hears music and so does Bob once he is in the
	  queue. Bob then transfers Alice into the queue and then music for
	  Alice stops even though she should be hearing it since has now
	  replaced Bob in the queue. The problem that was occurring is that
	  once the channel was masqueraded the app (queues, confbridge,
	  etc...) had no way of knowing that the channel had just been
	  swapped out thus it did not start music for the present channel.

	  occur in 1.8/11, as features will most likely provide some

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c, /: chan_dahdi: handle DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVED
	  on a pri D-Channel When a DAHDI device is removed at run-time it
	  sends the event DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVED on each channel. This is
	  intended to signal the userspace program to close the respective
	  file handle, as the driver of the device will need all of them
	  closed to properly clean-up. This event has long since been
	  handled in chan_dahdi (chan_zap at the time). However the event
	  that is sent on a D-Channel of a "PRI" (ISDN) span simply gets
	  ignored. This commit adds handling for closing the file

	  also adds a CLI command 'pri destroy span <N>' to destroy the

	  disconnect. The problem happens because newer values in the enum
	  ast_control_frame_type are not consistent between the branch
	  versions of Asterisk. For example: 1) v1.4 calls v1.8 (or later)
	  using IAX2 2) v1.8 answers and sends a connected line update
	  control frame. (on v1.8 AST_CONTROL_CONNECTED_LINE = 22) 3) v1.4
	  receives the control frame as an end-of-q (on v1.4
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q = 22) 4) v1.4 disconnects the call once the
	  receive queue becomes empty. Several things are done by this

	* res/res_fax_spandsp.c: res_fax_spandsp: Always init T.38 session
	  to avoid crashes during state change Prior to this patch,
	  res_fax_spandsp was conservative with how it initialized the
	  spandsp T.38 context. It would only initialize it if the driver
	  thought the current state was a T.38 fax. While this works fine
	  in nominal situations, in certain off nominal situations,
	  res_fax_spandsp can believe that a T.38 fax will not occur when
	  in fact one has started. In particular, this was discovered when
	  res_fax would fall back to audio after timing out on a T.38
	  upgrade. The SIP channel driver would continue to retry the
	  re-INVITE and - if the remote end responded after res_fax timed
	  out with a 200 OK - a T.38 frame would be delivered to the
	  res_fax stack when it no longer expected it. As it turns out,
	  there does not appear to be any downside to always initializing
	  the T.38 context, other than the actual memory allocation. Since
	  that avoids this off nominal situation (and others which are
	  equally likely hard to predict), this is the safest way to avoid
	  this problem. Much thanks to Torrey as well for providing a
	  scenario that reproduces this issue. (closes issue

	  hanging on CentOS 6 64-bit build agents. After resolving a number
	  of problems with symbols, strange locks, and other shenanigans,
	  the problem has persisted. In all cases, gdb shows the Asterisk
	  process stuck in loader.c on one of the infinite while loops that
	  calls dlclose repeatedly until success. The documentation of
	  dlclose states that it returns 0 on success; any other value on
	  error. It does not state that repeatedly calling it will
	  eventually clear those errors. Most likely, the repeated calls to
	  dlclose was to force a close by exhausting the references on the
	  library; however, that will never succeed if: (a) There is some
	  fundamental error at work in the loaded library that precludes
	  unloading it (b) Some other loaded module is referencing a symbol
	  in the currently loaded module This results in Asterisk sitting
	  forever. Since we have matching pairs of dlopen/dlclose, this
	  patch opts to only call dlclose once, and log out as an ERROR if
	  dlclose fails to return success. If nothing else, this might help
	  to determine why on the CentOS 6 64-bit build agent things are
	  not closing successfully. Review:

	* main/translate.c, main/xmldoc.c, main/channel.c, main/pbx.c:
	  Remove some spammy debug messages; improve clarity of others
	  Debug messages aren't free. Even when the debug level is
	  sufficiently low such that the messages are never evaluated,
	  there is a cost to having to parse Asterisk logs that contain
	  debug messages that (a) fail to convey sufficient information or
	  (b) occur so frequently as to be next to meaningless. Based on
	  having to stare at lots of DEBUG messages, this patch makes the
	  following changes: * channel.c: When copying variables from a
	  parent channel to a child channel, specify the channels involved.
	  Do not log anything for a variable that is not inherited; the
	  fact that it doesn't have an _ or __ already signifies that it
	  won't be inherited. * pbx.c: Specify what function evaluation has
	  occurred that created the result. * translate.c: Bump up the
	  translator path messages to 10. I've never once had to use these
	  debug messages, and for each format that is registered (on
	  startup) and unregistered (on shutdown) the entire f^2 matrix is
	  logged out. For short tests in the Asterisk Test Suite, this
	  should make finding the actual test much easier. * xmldoc.c: The
	  debug message that 'blah' is not found in the tree is expected.
	  Often, description elements - which are not required - are not
	  provided. This debug message adds no additional value, as it is
	  not indicative of an error or helpful in debugging which element
	  did not contain a 'blah' element as a child. If an element is
	  supposed to contain a child element, then that XML tree should
	  have failed validation in the first place. Review:

	  This patch allows individual dialplan functions to be marked as

	  escalation. For example, if one were to read the channel variable
	  SHELL(rm -rf /) Bad Things(TM) could happen; even if the external
	  source has only read permissions.

	  Execution from external sources may be enabled by setting
	  'live_dangerously' to 'yes' in the [options] section of
	  asterisk.conf. Although doing so is not recommended.

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: res_rtp_asterisk: Correct erroneous lost
	  packet information in RTCP reports RTCP's calculation of the
	  number of lost packets in an RTP stream is based on that stream's
	  sequence number count, the number of received packets, and how
	  many packets we expect to receive. When the SSRC for an RTP
	  stream changes, there can - and almost always will be - a large
	  jump in the next packet's timestamp and sequence number. If we
	  don't reset the number of received packets, sequence number
	  count, and other metrics used by RTCP, the next RR/SR report will
	  use the previous SSRC's values to calculate the lost packet count
	  for the new SSRC - resulting in a very large number of lost
	  packets. This patch modifies res_rtp_asterisk such that, if it
	  detects a SSRC change, it will reset the various values used by

	* channels/sip/include/sip.h, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Reject
	  calls on 200 OKs if no SDP has been received When Asterisk

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Realtime Peer Update Problem When
	  Un-registering And Expires Header In 200ok 1st Issue When a
	  realtime peer sends an un-REGISTER request, Asterisk un-registers
	  the peer but the database table record still has regseconds and
	  fullcontact for the peer. This results in calls attempting to be
	  routed to the peer which is no longer registered. The expected
	  behavior is to get busy/congested when attempting to call an
	  un-registered peer through the dialplan. What was discovered is
	  that we are clearing out the peer's registration in the database
	  in parse_register_contact() when calling expire_register() but
	  then upon returning from parse_register_contact(), update_peer()
	  is run which stores back in the database table regseconds and
	  fullcontact. 2nd Issue The reporter pointed out that the 200 ok
	  being returned by Asterisk after un-registering a peer contains a
	  Contact header with ;expires= and the Expires header is not set
	  to 0. This is actually a regression. Tests were created for this
	  second issue (ASTERISK-22548). The tests have been reviewed and a
	  Ship It! was received on those tests. This patch does the
	  following: * Do not ignore the Expires header value even when it
	  is set to 0. The patch sets the pvt->expiry earlier on in the
	  function so that it is set properly and used. * If pvt->expiry is
	  0, do not call update_peer since that means the peer has already
	  been un-registered and there is no need to update the database
	  record again since nothing has changed. (closes issue

	  In r378303 the AST_FLAG_DISABLE_DEVSTATE_CACHE flag was added that
	  tells the devstate system to not cache states for non-real devices.
	  However, when optimizing away channels (ast_do_masquerade), that flag
	  wasn't copied.

	  In my case, using Local devices as queue members created a situation
	  where the endpoint was considered in use, but the state change of the
	  device being available again was ignored (not cached). The endpoint
	  channel was optimized into the (previously) Local channel, but kept
	  the do-not-cache flag. The end result being that the queue member
	  apparently stayed in use forever.

	  debug threads enabled, on some systems, there's a lock ordering
	  problem between our mutex and glibc's mutex protecting its module
	  list (Ubuntu Lucid, glibc 2.11.1 in this instance). In one
	  thread, the module list will be locked before acquiring our
	  mutex. In another thread, our mutex will be locked before locking
	  the module list (which happens in the depths of calling
	  backtrace()). This patch fixes this issue by moving backtrace()
	  calls outside of critical sections that have the mutex acquired.
	  The bigger change was to reentrancy tracking for
	  ast_cond_{timed,}wait, which wrongly assumed that waiting on the
	  mutex was equivalent to a single unlock (it actually suspends all
	  recursive locks on the mutex). (closes issue ASTERISK-22455)

	* include/asterisk/frame.h: Set 14400 as the default max bit rate
	  if T38MaxBitRate is not specified If an endpoint fails to include
	  the T38MaxBitRate attribute during negotiation, Asterisk will
	  negotiate a bit rate of 2400 instead of the ITU recommended bit
	  rate of 14400. This patch fixes this by making AST_T38_RATE_14400
	  the 'default' value of the enum by assigning it a value of 0,
	  such that if an endpoint fails to include the attribute, the
	  default will be 14400. Note that Walter Doekes included the nice
	  comment in frame.h about why we are purposefully assigning
	  AST_T38_RATE_14400 a value of 0. (closes issue ASTERISK-22275)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Not Storing Current Incoming Recv
	  Address In 1.8, r384779 introduced a regression by retrieving an
	  old dialog and keeping the old recv address since recv was
	  already set. This has caused a problem when a proxy is involved
	  since responses to incoming requests from the proxy server, after
	  an outbound call is established, are never sent to the correct
	  recv address. In 11, r382322 introduced this regression. The fix
	  is to revert that change and always store the recv address on
	  incoming requests. Thank you Walter Doekes for helping to point
	  out this error and Mark Michelson for your input/review of the
	  fix. (closes issue ASTERISK-22071) Reported by: Alex Zarubin

	* main/data.c: Fix invalid access to disposed memory in main/data
	  unit test It is not safe to iterate over a macro'd list of ao2
	  objects, deref them such that the item's destructor is called,
	  and leave them in the list. The list macro to iterate over items
	  requires the item to be a valid allocated object in order to
	  proceed to the next item; with MALLOC_DEBUG on the corruption of
	  the linked list is caught in the crash. This patch fixes the
	  invalid access to free'd memory by removing the ao2 item from the

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Registration Failure When A Peer And TLS
	  Are Used If a peer is used in a register line and TLS is defined

	* main/http.c: Tolerate presence of RFC2965 Cookie2 header by
	  ignoring it This patch modifies parsing of cookies in Asterisk's
	  http server by doing an explicit comparison of the "Cookie"
	  header instead of looking at the first 6 characters to determine
	  if the header is a cookie header. This avoids parsing "Cookie2"
	  headers and overwriting the previously parsed "Cookie" header.
	  Note that we probably should be appending the cookies in each
	  "Cookie" header to the parsed results; however, while clients can
	  send multiple cookie headers they never really do. While this
	  patch doesn't improve Asterisk's behavior in that regard, it
	  shouldn't make it any worse either. Note that the solution in

	* configs/sla.conf.sample, include/asterisk/utils.h,
	  apps/app_meetme.c: astobj2-ify the SLA code The SLA code within
	  app_meetme was written before asotbj2 had been merged into
	  Asterisk. Worse, support for reloads did not exist at first and
	  was added later as a bolt-on feature. I knew at the time that
	  reloading was not safe at all while SLA was in use, so the reload
	  would be queued up to execute when the system was idle.
	  Unfortunately, this approach was still prone to errors beyond the
	  fact that this was the only place in Asterisk where configuration
	  was not reloaded instantly when requested. This patch converts
	  various SLA objects to be reference counted objects using
	  astobj2. This allows reloads to be processed while the system is
	  in use. The code ensures that the objects will not disappear
	  while one of the other threads is using them. However, they will
	  be immediately removed from the global trunk and station
	  containers so no new calls will use them if removed from
	  configuration. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2581/

	* UPGRADE.txt, apps/app_queue.c, configs/queues.conf.sample: Add
	  announce-to-first-user option for app_queue In r386792, the
	  ability to play prompts to the first caller in a call queue was
	  added. While this is arguably a bug fix for those who expect the
	  first caller to continue receiving prompts while the agent is
	  dialed, it has the side effect of preventing the first caller
	  from hearing the agent immediately upon bridging. This may not be
	  a problem for those who really want this option, but for those
	  who didn't care whether or not the first caller in queue heard
	  their position, it was an issue. This patch disables the ability
	  for the first caller in the queue to hear prompts and adds a new
	  option, announce-to-first-user, to queues.conf. Those who the
	  behavior can enable it by setting this value to True. Note that

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Make SLA reload more paranoid. Reload support
	  was originally not included for SLA. It was added later, but in a
	  fairly non-traditional way. It basically sets a flag indicating
	  that a reload is pending, and then waits for a time where it
	  thinks everything SLA related is idle and unused, and *then*
	  executes the reload. It does this because the reload process is
	  destructive. It starts by throwing everything away and starting
	  over. There are a number of problems with this approach. One of
	  them is that the check to see if anything in use was incomplete.
	  This patch makes it more complete and thus less likely for a
	  crash to occur during reload processing. However, this approach
	  still has problems so some much more significant reworking of
	  this code will need to come in as a next step. Patch credit and

	  The minimum of 32 seconds and one third of the session interval

	  RFC 4028 Section 7.2 "UACs MUST be prepared to receive a
	  Session-Expires header field in a response, even if none were
	  present in the request." What changed After ASTERISK-20787,
	  inbound calls to asterisk with no Session-Expires in the INVITE
	  are now are offered a Session-Expires (1800 asterisk default) in
	  the response, with asterisk as the refresher. Symptom: After 900
	  seconds (asterisk default refresher period 1800), asterisk
	  RE-INVITEs the device, the device may respond with a much lower
	  Session-Expires (180 in our case) value that it is now using.
	  Asterisk ignores this response, as it's deemed both an INBOUND
	  CALL, and a RE-INVITE. After 180 seconds the device times out and
	  sends BYE (hangs up), asterisk is still working with the
	  refresher period of 1800 as it ignored the 'Session Expires: 180'

	* main/features.c: Fix CDR not being created during an externally
	  initiated blind transfer Way back when in the dark days of
	  Asterisk 1.8.9, blind transferring a call in a context that
	  included the 'h' extension would inadvertently execute the hangup
	  code logic on the transferred channel. This was a "bad thing".
	  The fix was to properly check for the softhangup flags on the
	  channel and only execute the 'h' extension logic (and, in later
	  versions, hangup handler logic) if the channel was well and truly
	  dead (Jim). Unfortunately, CDRs are fickle. Setting the
	  softhangup flag when we detected that the channel was leaving the
	  bridge (but not to die) caused some crucial snippet of CDR code,
	  lying in ambush in the middle of the bridging code, to not get
	  executed. This had the effect of blowing away one of the CDRs
	  that is typically created during a blind transfer. While we live
	  and die by the adage "don't touch CDRs in release branches", this
	  was our bad. The attached patch restores the CDR behavior, and
	  still manages to not run the 'h' extension during a blind
	  transfer (at least not when it's supposed to). Thanks to Steve
	  Davies for diagnosing this and providing a fix. Review:

	* res/res_timing_pthread.c: Prevent res_timing_pthread from
	  blocking callers There were several reports of deadlock when
	  using res_timing_pthread. Backtraces indicated that one thread
	  was blocked waiting for the write to the pipe to complete and
	  this thread held the container lock for the timers. Therefore any
	  thread that wanted to create a new timer or read an existing
	  timer would block waiting for either the timer lock or the
	  container lock and deadlock ensued. This patch changes the way
	  the pipe is used to eliminate this source of deadlocks: 1) The
	  pipe is placed in non-blocking mode so that it would never block
	  even if the following changes someone fail... 2) Instead of
	  writing bytes into the pipe for each "tick" that's fired the pipe
	  now has two states--signaled and unsignaled. If signaled, the
	  pipe is hot and any pollers of the read side filedescriptor will
	  be woken up. If unsigned the pipe is idle. This eliminates even
	  the chance of filling up the pipe and reduces the potential
	  overhead of calling unnecessary writes. 3) Since we're tracking
	  the signaled / unsignaled state, we can eliminate the exta poll
	  system call for every firing because we know that there is data
	  to be read. (closes issue ASTERISK-21389) Reported by: Matt

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix crash in chan_sip when a core initiated
	  op occurs at the same time as a BYE When a BYE request is
	  processed in chan_sip, the current SIP dialog is detached from
	  its associated Asterisk channel structure. The tech_pvt pointer
	  in the channel object is set to NULL, and the dialog persists for
	  an RFC mandated period of time to handle re-transmits. While this
	  process occurs, the channel is locked (which is good).
	  Unfortunately, operations that are initiated externally have no
	  way of knowing that the channel they've just obtained (which is
	  still valid) and that they are attempting to lock is about to
	  have its tech_pvt pointer removed. By the time they obtain the
	  channel lock and call the channel technology callback, the
	  tech_pvt is NULL. This patch adds a few checks to some channel
	  callbacks that make sure the tech_pvt isn't NULL before using it.
	  Prime offenders were the DTMF digit callbacks, which would crash
	  if AMI initiated a DTMF on the channel at the same time as a BYE
	  was received from the UA. This patch also adds checks on
	  sip_transfer (as AMI can also cause a callback into this
	  function), as well as sip_indicate (as lots of things can queue
	  an indication onto a channel). Review:

	* UPGRADE.txt, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix For Not Overriding The

	  happening and looking into what was causing this, it was
	  discovered that other default settings would not be overriden as

	  create a temporary ast_flags structure and using a mask, we
	  override the default settings with whatever is set in the

	* Fix CDR not being created during an externally initiated blind
	  transfer

	  Way back when in the dark days of Asterisk 1.8.9, blind transferring
	  a call in a context that included the 'h' extension would
	  inadvertently execute the hangup code logic on the transferred
	  channel. This was a "bad thing". The fix was to properly check for
	  the softhangup flags on the channel and only execute the 'h'
	  extension logic (and, in later versions, hangup handler logic) if
	  the channel was well and truly dead (Jim).

	  Unfortunately, CDRs are fickle. Setting the softhangup flag when we
	  detected that the channel was leaving the bridge (but not to die)
	  caused some crucial snippet of CDR code, lying in ambush in the
	  middle of the bridging code, to not get executed. This had the
	  effect of blowing away one of the CDRs that is typically created
	  during a blind transfer.

	  While we live and die by the adage "don't touch CDRs in release
	  branches", this was our bad. The attached patch restores the CDR
	  behavior, and still manages to not run the 'h' extension during a
	  blind transfer (at least not when it's supposed to).

	  Thanks to Steve Davies for diagnosing this and providing a fix.

	* Prevent res_timing_pthread from blocking callers

	  There were several reports of deadlock when using res_timing_pthread.
	  Backtraces indicated that one thread was blocked waiting for the
	  write to the pipe to complete and this thread held the container lock
	  for the timers.  Therefore any thread that wanted to create a new
	  timer or read an existing timer would block waiting for either the
	  timer lock or the container lock and deadlock ensued.

	  This patch changes the way the pipe is used to eliminate this source
	  of deadlocks:

	  1) The pipe is placed in non-blocking mode so that it would never
	     block even if the following changes someone fail...

	  2) Instead of writing bytes into the pipe for each "tick" that's
	     fired the pipe now has two states--signaled and unsignaled. If
	     signaled, the pipe is hot and any pollers of the read side
	     filedescriptor will be woken up. If unsigned the pipe is idle.
	     This eliminates even the chance of filling up the pipe and reduces
	     the potential overhead of calling unnecessary writes.

	  3) Since we're tracking the signaled / unsignaled state, we can
	  eliminate the exta poll system call for every firing because we know
	  that there is data to be read.

	* Fix crash when AMI redirect action redirects two channels out of a
	  bridge.

	  The two party bridging loops were changing the bridge peer pointers
	  without the channel locks held.  Thus when ast_channel_massquerade()
	  tested and used the pointer there is a small window of opportunity
	  for the pointers to become NULL even though the masquerade code has
	  the channels locked.

	* channels/sip/include/sip.h, channels/chan_sip.c: AST-2013-003:
	  Prevent username disclosure in SIP channel driver When
	  authenticating a SIP request with alwaysauthreject enabled,

	  discloses whether a user exists for INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve deadlock between SIP registration
	  and channel based functions In r373424, several reentrancy
	  problems in chan_sip were addressed. As a result, the SIP channel
	  driver is now properly locking the channel driver private
	  information in certain operations that it wasn't previously. This
	  exposed two latent problems either in register_verify or by
	  functions called by register_verify. This includes: * Holding the
	  private lock while calling sip_send_mwi_to_peer. This can create
	  a new sip_pvt via sip_alloc, which will obtain the channel
	  container lock. This is a locking inversion, as any channel
	  related lock must be obtained prior to obtaining the SIP channel
	  technology private lock. * Holding the privat elock while calling
	  sip_poke_peer. In the same vein as sip_send_mwi_to_peer,
	  sip_poke_peer can create a new SIP private, causing the same
	  locking inversion. Note that this locking inversion typically
	  occured when CLI commands were run while a SIP REGISTER request
	  was being processed, as many CLI commands (such as 'sip show
	  channels', 'core show channels', etc.) have to obtain the channel
	  container lock. (issue ASTERISK-21068) Reported by: Nicolas

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Prevent deadlock in chan_iax2 when
	  attempting to set caller ID A deadlock can occur in chan_iax2
	  when it attempts to set the caller ID, as it already holds the
	  iax2 private lock and improperly fails to obtain the channel lock
	  before calling ast_set_callerid. By not safely obtaining the
	  channel lock, a locking inversion can take place, causing a
	  deadlock. This patch solves this by calling the required deadlock
	  avoidance functions that obtain the channel lock before setting
	  the caller ID. Thanks to Pavel for fixing my syntax errors and
	  testing this patch out. (closes issue ASTERISK-21128) Reported

	* UPGRADE.txt, apps/app_meetme.c: Let channels joining a MeetMe
	  conference opt out of the denoiser For some channel drivers,
	  specifically those that have a varying rate in the number of
	  audio samples, the audio quality for a MeetMe conference can be
	  exceedingly poor. This is due to a unilateral application of the
	  DENOISE function in func_speex to channels joining the
	  conference. The denoiser function in the speex library is
	  initialized with the number of audio samples in each sample that
	  will be provided to it. If the number of audio samples changes,
	  the denoiser has to be thrown away and re-initialized. While this
	  could be worked around by removing func_speex, that doesn't help
	  if you actually use the denoiser with other channels on the
	  system. This patches does the following: * Checks for the
	  presence of func_speex as opposed to codec_speex when determining
	  if the DENOISE function is present (which is where the function
	  is actually implemented) * Adds an option to MeetMe 'n' that
	  causes the denoiser to not be applied to a channel when it joins.
	  This keeps the current behavior the default, but let's users
	  disable the denoiser if it causes problems on their system.

	* main/manager.c: Don't display the AMI ALL class authorization for
	  users if they don't have it When converting AMI class
	  authorizations to a string representation, the method always
	  appends the ALL class authorization. This is especially important
	  for events, as they should always communicate that class
	  authorization - even if the event itself does not specify ALL as
	  a class authorization for itself. (Events have always assumed
	  that the ALL class authorization is implied when they are raised)
	  Unfortunately, this did mean that specifying a user with
	  restricted class authorizations would show up in the 'manager
	  show user' CLI command as having the ALL class authorization.
	  Rather then modifying the existing string manipulation function,
	  this patch adds a function that will only return a string if the
	  field being compared explicitly matches class authorization field
	  it is being compared against. This prevents ALL from being
	  returned unless it is actually specified for the user. (closes

	  Default 'priority+1'. Unfortunately, the application was sending
	  the channel back into the dialplan at 'priority', which is the
	  ParkAndAnnounce application call. This causes an infinite loop of
	  the channel constantly being parked, announced, timed out,
	  parked, announced, timed out... while fun, especially for those
	  callers you wish to drive to the end of madness, this was not the
	  intent of the application. (closes issue ASTERISK-20113) Reported

	* Resolve deadlock between pending CDR and batch CDR locks

	r375757 attempted to resolve a race condition between multiple
	submissions of CDRs while in batch mode from attempting to destroy the
	scheduled batch	submission by extending the batch CDR lock. Unfortunately,
	this causes a deadlock between the pending CDR lock and the batch CDR lock.
	This patch resolves the intent of r375757 by simply providing a new lock
	that protects the scheduling of the batches. The original batch CDR lock
	is kept to protect manipulation of the batch CDR settings, but has been
	placed such that it is not held when the pending lock is held.

	Thanks to Chase Venters for providing lock analysis on the issue.

	* Resolve deadlock between SIP registration and channel based
	functions

	In r373424, several reentrancy problems in chan_sip were addressed. As
	a result, the SIP channel driver is now properly locking the channel
	driver private information in certain operations that it wasn't previously.
	This exposed two latent problems either in register_verify or by functions
	called by register_verify. This includes:
	 * Holding the private lock while calling sip_send_mwi_to_peer. This
	 can create a new sip_pvt via sip_alloc, which will obtain the channel
	 container lock. This is a locking inversion, as any channel related lock
	 must be obtained prior to obtaining the SIP channel technology private
	 lock.
	 * Holding the private lock while calling sip_poke_peer. In the same vein as
         sip_send_mwi_to_peer, sip_poke_peer can create a new SIP private, causing
         the same locking inversion.

	Note that this locking inversion typically occured when CLI commands were run
	while a SIP REGISTER request was being processed, as many CLI commands (such
	as 'sip show channels', 'core show channels', etc.) have to obtain the channel
	container lock.

	* AST-2013-002: Prevent denial of service in HTTP server

	AST-2012-014, fixed in January of this year, contained a fix for
	Asterisk's HTTP server for a remotely-triggered crash. While the fix put in
	place fixed the possibility for the crash to be triggered, a denial of
	service vector still exists with that solution if an attacker sends one or
	more HTTP POST requests with very large Content-Length values. This patch
	resolves this by capping the Content-Length at 1024 bytes. Any attempt to send
	an HTTP POST with Content-Length greater than this cap will not result in any
	memory allocation. The POST will be responded to with an HTTP 413 "Request
	Entity Too Large" response.

	This issue was reported by Christoph Hebeisen of TELUS Security Labs

	* AST-2013-003: Prevent username disclosure in SIP channel driver

	When authenticating a SIP request with alwaysauthreject enabled,
	allowguest disabled, and autocreatepeer disabled, Asterisk discloses whether
	a user exists for INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and REGISTER transactions in
	multiple ways. The information is disclosed when:
	 * A "407 Proxy Authentication Required" response is sent instead of a
	   "401 Unauthorized" response
	 * The presence or absence of additional tags occurs at the end of
	   "403 Forbidden" (such as "(Bad Auth)")
	 * A "401 Unauthorized" response is sent instead of "403 Forbidden"
	   response after a retransmission
	 * Retransmission are sent when a matching peer did not exist, but not
	   when a matching peer did exist.
	This patch resolves these various vectors by ensuring that the responses sent
	in all scenarios is the same, regardless of the presence of a matching peer.

	This issue was reported by Walter Doekes, OSSO B.V. A substantial portion of
	the testing and the solution to this problem was done by Walter as well - a
	huge thanks to his tireless efforts in finding all the ways in which this
	setting didn't work, providing automated tests, and working with Kinsey on
	getting this fixed.

	* Fix white noise on SRTP decryption

	When res_rtp_asterisk.c was altered to avoid attempting to apply
	unprotect algorithms to non-audio RTP packets, the test used was
	incorrect. This caused the audio packets to not be decrypted and
	resulted in loud white noise on the other endpoint (or both endpoints
	depending on the call legs involved). The test now properly checks the
	version field in the RTP header to ensure that RTP and RTCP are
	decrypted while other types of packets are not.

	* main/file.c: Change cleanup ordering in filestream destructor.
	  This patch came about due to a problem observed where wav files
	  had an empty header. The header is supposed to be updated in
	  wav_close(). It turns out that this was broken when the
	  cache_record_files option from asterisk.conf was enabled. The
	  cleanup code was moving the file to its final destination
	  *before* running the close() method of the file destructor, so
	  the header didn't get updated. Another problem here is that the
	  move was being done before actually closing the FILE *. Finally,
	  the last bug fixed here is that I noticed that wav_close() checks
	  for stream->filename to be non-NULL. In the previous cleanup
	  order, it's checking a pointer to freed memory. This doesn't
	  actually cause anything to break, but it's treading on dangerous
	  waters. Now the free() of stream->filename is happening after the
	  format module's close() method gets called, so it's safer.

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Fix station ringback; trunk hangup issues in
	  SLA This patch fixes two bugs: * If an outbound call is made from
	  a SLA phone using SLAStation, then there is no ringtone audible
	  to the phone that originates the call. The indication of the
	  ringing was not being passed to the SLA station; this patch fixes
	  that by passing through the progress indications. * If an SLA
	  station hangs up before the called party answers, then the
	  channel to the called party continues to ring until a timeout
	  occurs. If the called party manages to answer, Asterisk attempts
	  to connect the called party to a non-existant MeetMe room. This
	  patch corrects the behavior by abandoning the call attempt if it
	  detects that the SLA station is no longer in use while attempting
	  to call the called party. Review:

	  tests/test_xml_escape.c (added): Fix XML encoding of 'identity
	  display' in NOTIFY messages. XML encoding in chan_sip is
	  accomplished by naively building the XML directly from strings.
	  While this usually works, it fails to take into account escaping
	  the reserved characters in XML. This patch adds an
	  'ast_xml_escape' function, which works similarly to
	  'ast_uri_encode'. This is used to properly escape the
	  local_display attribute in XML formatted NOTIFY messages. Several
	  things to note: * The Right Thing(TM) to do would probably be to
	  replace the ast_build_string stuff with building an ast_xml_doc.
	  That's a much bigger change, and out of scope for the original
	  ticket, so I refrained myself. * It is with great sadness that I
	  wrote my own ast_xml_escape function. There's one in libxml2, but
	  it's knee-deep in libxml2-ness, and not easily used to one-off
	  escape a string. * I only escaped the string we know is causing
	  problems (local_display). At least some of the other strings are
	  URI-encoded, which should be XML safe. Rather than figuring out
	  what's safe and escaping what's not, it would be much cleaner to
	  simply build an ast_xml_doc for the messages and let the XML
	  library do the XML escaping. Like I said, that's out of scope.

	  Prevent exhaustion of system resources through exploitation of
	  event cache Asterisk maintains an internal cache for devices in
	  the event subsystem. The device state cache holds the state of
	  each device known to Asterisk, such that consumers of device
	  state information can query for the last known state for a
	  particular device, even if it is not part of an active call. The
	  concept of a device in Asterisk can include entities that do not
	  have a physical representation. One way that this occurred was
	  when anonymous calls are allowed in Asterisk. A device was
	  automatically created and stored in the cache for each anonymous
	  call that occurred; this was possible in the SIP and IAX2 channel
	  drivers and through channel drivers that utilized the
	  res_jabber/res_xmpp resource modules (Gtalk, Jingle, and Motif).
	  These devices are never removed from the system, allowing
	  anonymous calls to potentially exhaust a system's resources. This
	  patch changes the event cache subsystem and device state
	  management to no longer cache devices that are not associated
	  with a physical entity. (issue ASTERISK-20175) Reported by:

	* res/res_jabber.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h,
	  channels/chan_sip.c, main/http.c: Resolve crashes due to large
	  stack allocations when using TCP Asterisk had several places
	  where messages received over various network transports may be
	  copied in a single stack allocation. In the case of TCP, since
	  multiple packets in a stream may be concatenated together, this
	  can lead to large allocations that overflow the stack. This patch
	  modifies those portions of Asterisk using TCP to either favor
	  heap allocations or use an upper bound to ensure that the stack
	  will not overflow: * For SIP, the allocation now has an upper
	  limit * For HTTP, the allocation is now a heap allocation instead
	  of a stack allocation * For XMPP (in res_jabber), the allocation
	  has been eliminated since it was unnecesary. Note that the HTTP
	  portion of this issue was independently found by Brandon Edwards
	  of Exodus Intelligence. (issue ASTERISK-20658) Reported by:

	* AST-2012-014: Resolve crashes due to large stack allocations when
	  using TCP

	  Asterisk had several places where messages received over various
	  network transports may be copied in a single stack allocation. In
	  the case of TCP, since multiple packets in a stream may be
	  concatenated together, this can lead to large allocations that
	  overflow the stack.

	  This patch modifies those portions of Asterisk using TCP to either
	  favor heap allocations or use an upper bound to ensure that the
	  stack will not overflow:
	  * For SIP, the allocation now has an upper limit
	  * For HTTP, the allocation is now a heap allocation instead of a
	    stack allocation
	  * For XMPP, the allocation has been eliminated since it was
	    unnecessary.

	* AST-2012-015: Prevent exhaustion of system resources through
	  exploitation of event cache 

	  Asterisk maintains an internal cache for devices in the event
	  subsystem. The device state cache holds the state of each device
	  known to Asterisk, such that consumers of device state information
	  can query for the last known state for a particular device, even if
	  it is not part of an active call. The concept of a device in
	  Asterisk can include entities that do not have a physical
	  representation. One way that this occurred was when anonymous calls
	  are allowed in Asterisk. A device was automatically created and
	  stored in the cache for each anonymous call that occurred; this was
	  possible in the SIP and IAX2 channel drivers and through channel
	  drivers that utilized the res_jabber/res_xmpp resource modules (Gtalk,
	  Jingle, and Motif). These devices are never removed from the system,
	  allowing anonymous call to potentially exhaust a system's resources.

	  This patch changes the event cache subsystem and device state
	  management to no longer cache devices that are not associated with a
	  physical entity.

	* Revert bad ringinuse=no patch.

	  With the option ringinuse=no set, the patch committed previous for
	  ASTERISK-16115 causes non-SIP queue members to never be called
	  because the device state is checked after a channel is created to
	  determine if the member is busy. These queue members always get the
	  "Member %s is busy, cannot dial" message.

	  Most channel drivers other than chan_sip use the default device
	  state handling. The default device state is considered in use or
	  unknown if the channel exists or not, respectively.

	* Fix multiple calls to a queue member that is only in queue.

	  When ringinuse=no queue members can receive more than one call if
	  these calls happen at nearly the same time. This patch fixes it so a
	  queu member does not receive more than one call from a queue. note
	  that this fix does not prevent multiple calls to a member if hte
	  member is in more than one queue (see ASTERISK-16115).

	  This function is now given a SIP request structure which it can

	  memory allocations done since the internal allocated components
	  are reused between packets and also ensures the SIP request
	  structure is deinitialized when the TLS connection is torn down.

	  they cannot disappear out from under us. In the wild, crashes
	  were sometimes seen when the transferring party would hang up the
	  call before the transfer target answered the call. The most
	  common place to see the crash occur was when attempting to send a
	  connected line update to the transferer channel. (closes issue

	  Re-initialize logmsgs mutex upon logger initialization to prevent
	  lock errors Similar to the patch that moved the fork earlier in
	  the startup sequence to prevent mutex errors in the recursive
	  mutex surrounding the read/write thread registration lock, this
	  patch re-initializes the logmsgs mutex. Part of the start up
	  sequence before forking the process into the background includes
	  reading asterisk.conf; this has to occur prior to the call to
	  daemon in order to read startup parameters. When reading in a
	  conf file, log statements can be generated. Since this can't be
	  avoided, the mutex instead is re-initialized to ensure a reset of
	  any thread tracking information. This patch also includes some
	  additional debugging to catch errors when locking or unlocking
	  the recursive mutex that surrounds locks when the DEBUG_THREADS
	  build option is enabled. DO_CRASH or THREAD_CRASH will cause an
	  abort() if a mutex error is detected. (issue ASTERISK-19463)

	* main/utils.c, main/stdtime/localtime.c, main/asterisk.c: Reorder
	  startup sequence to prevent lockups when process is sent to
	  background Although it is very rare and timing dependent, the
	  potential exists for the call to 'daemon' to cause what appears
	  to be a deadlock in Asterisk during startup. This can occur when
	  a recursive mutex is obtained prior to the daemon call executing.
	  Since daemon uses fork to send the process into the background,
	  any threading primitives are unsafe to re-use after the call.
	  Implementations of pthread recursive mutexes are highly likely to
	  store the thread identifier of the thread that previously
	  obtained the mutex. If the mutex was locked prior to the fork, a
	  subsequent unlock operation will potentially fail as the thread
	  identifier is no longer valid. Since the mutex is still locked,
	  all subsequent attempts to grab the mutex by other threads will
	  block. This behavior exhibited itself most often when
	  DEBUG_THREADS was enabled, as this compile time option surrounds
	  the mutexes in Asterisk with another recursive mutex that
	  protects the storage of thread related information. This made it
	  much more likely that a recursive mutex would be obtained prior
	  to daemon and unlocked after the call. This patch does the
	  following: a) It backports a patch from Asterisk 11 that prevents
	  the spawning of the localtime monitoring thread. This thread is
	  now spawned after Asterisk has fully booted. b) It re-orders the
	  startup sequence to call daemon earlier during Asterisk startup.
	  This limits the potential of threading primitives being accessed
	  by initialization calls before daemon is called. c) It removes
	  calls to ast_verbose/ast_log/etc. prior to daemon being called.
	  Developers should send error messages directly to stderr prior to
	  daemon, as calls to ast_log may access recursive mutexes that
	  store thread related information. d) It reorganizes when thread
	  local storage is created for storing lock information during the
	  creation of threads. Prior to this patch, the read/write lock
	  protecting the list of threads in ast_register_thread would
	  utilize the lock in the thread local storage prior to it being
	  initialized; this patch prevents that. On a very related note,
	  this patch will *greatly* improve the stability of the Asterisk
	  Test Suite. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2197

	* res/res_monitor.c: monitor: prevent attempts to move/remove

	  throughout the code. Prior to this change, a common method for
	  determining if a timeout was reached was to call a function such
	  as ast_waitfor_n() and inspect the out parameter that told how
	  many milliseconds were left, then use that as the input to
	  ast_waitfor_n() on the next go-around. The problem with this is
	  that in some cases, submillisecond timeouts can occur, resulting
	  in the out parameter not decreasing any. When this happens
	  thousands of times, the result is that the timeout takes much
	  longer than intended to be reached. As an example, I had a
	  situation where a 3 second timeout took multiple days to finally
	  end since most wakeups from ast_waitfor_n() were under a
	  millisecond. This patch seeks to fix this pattern throughout the
	  code. Now we log the time when an operation began and find the
	  difference in wall clock time between now and when the event
	  started. This means that sub-millisecond timeouts now cannot play
	  havoc when trying to determine if something has timed out. Part
	  of this fix also includes changing the function ast_waitfor() so
	  that it is possible for it to return less than zero when a
	  negative timeout is given to it. This makes it actually possible
	  to detect errors in ast_waitfor() when there is no timeout.

	  If the periodic function fires, it will attempt to iterate over a
	  NULL container. This patch checks for whether or not the sessions
	  container exists before attempting to purge sessions out of it.
	  If the sessions container is NULL, we simply return. Note that
	  this error was also caught by the Asterisk Test Suite.

	* main/manager.c: Properly clean up manager resources on exit This

	  This patch is a modified version of a patch originally committed

	  that fixed the memory leak during unloading XML documentation,
	  applies to branches 1.8 and 10 as well. The patch for this issue
	  was modified for these two branches. (issue ASTERISK-20648)

	* main/cdr.c: Prevent multiple CDR batches from conflicting when
	  scheduling the CDR write The Asterisk Test Suite caught an error
	  condition where a scheduled CDR batch write can be deleted twice
	  if two channels attempt to post their CDRs at the same time. The
	  batch CDR mutex is locked while the CDRs are appended to the
	  current batch list; however, it is unlocked prior to actually
	  scheduling the CDR write. As such, two threads can attempt to
	  remove the currently scheduled batch write at the same time,
	  resulting in an assertion error. This patch extends the time that
	  the mutex is locked to encompass actually scheduling the write.
	  This prevents two threads from unscheduling the currently
	  scheduled write at the same time.

	  chan_misdn: Fix loss of B channels if L1 is down. If you make 2
	  calls out an NT PTMP port which is not connected to any phone,
	  the B channel associated with that call becomes unusable until
	  Asterisk is restarted. The problem is the EVENT_SETUP is queued
	  when L1 is not up in misdn_lib_send_event(). If L1 cannot be
	  activated the event won't be dequeued. It gets even worse when
	  the call is hung up. The queued EVENT_SETUP will be overwritten
	  by an EVENT_DISCONNECT. The reserved B channel then will never be
	  freed. If later someone connects a phone to the port, L1 will
	  eventually activate and the queued EVENT_DISCONNECT is sent down
	  the stack. However, it is ignored because it is the wrong call
	  state. The real fix would be that activation and queueing for a
	  new SETUP is done by the NT stack. But since it doesn't, the
	  workaround must be removed because it doesn't always work. Fix:
	  The event is no longer queued but immediately sent to the stack.
	  If L1 cannot be activated, the L3 state machine that was started
	  by the EVENT_SETUP will do its work, i.e. a timeout will release
	  the B channel properly. The SETUP possibly cannot be sent the
	  first time but is resent by T303 in case L1 could be activated.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Wrong Result In Debug Message For SDP

	* res/res_calendar_ews.c: Properly extract the Body information of
	  an EWS calendar item Unlike all other calendar modules,
	  res_calendar_ews fails to extract the Body information for a
	  calendar item. This is due, in part, to a quirk in the schema in
	  the XML - not only does a CalendarItem contain a Body element,
	  but the CalendarItem exists as a descendant of a different Body
	  element. The neon parser was erroneously skipping all Body
	  elements. This patch fixes that by bypassing Body elements that
	  are not a child of CalendarItem, and parsing the Body element out
	  if it is a child. Note that the original patch by Terry Wilson
	  only needed slight modifications to make it properly pull the
	  Body information out; as such, while I've linked to the patch
	  that I uploaded for Dmitry, I've attributed the patch to Terry.

	  recv() on the file descriptor instead. Because TCP does not
	  guarantee that an entire message or even just one single message
	  will arrive during a read, a loop has been introduced to ensure
	  that we only attempt to handle a single message at a time. The
	  tcptls_session_instance structure has also had an overflow buffer
	  added to it so that if more than one TCP message arrives in one
	  go, there is a place to throw the excess. Huge thanks goes out to

	* main/cdr.c: Fix incorrect billing duration reported when batch
	  mode is enabled Similar to r369351, the billing duration can be
	  skewed when batch mode is enabled. This happened much more rarely
	  than the duration, as it only occured when the call was answered
	  (thereby indicating an actual answer time) and immediately hung
	  up on (indicating a billsec of 0). Since a billing time of '0'
	  can either mean that the call immediately ended or that the CDR
	  was improperly answered, we have to use additional information to
	  know whether or not we can trust the CDR billsec value. Prior to
	  this patch, we looked to see if we had a valid answer time. If we
	  did, and billsec was zero, we used the current time to calculate
	  what billsec value we could from the CDR being written. If batch
	  mode is enabled, this will incorrectly report a billsec value
	  being much greater than the actual duration of the call. Instead
	  of relying on the presence of an answer time to know whether or
	  not we can re-calculate the billsec for the CDR, we now also use
	  the presence of the CDR's end time to know if we need to
	  re-calculate or whether we can trust the billsec value that we
	  have. This prevents erroneous jumps in the billsec value, while
	  still making sure that in the worst case, some billing time will
	  be calculated. (closes issue AST-1016) Reported by: Thomas

	  discards that line, but continues to process the message
	  normally. Typically, this is not a problem because a) who has
	  lines that long and b) usually a discarded line results in an
	  invalid message. But if that line is specifying an optional
	  field, then the message will be processed, you get a 'Response:
	  Success', but things don't work the way you expected them to.
	  This patch changes the behavior when a line-too-long parse error
	  occurs. * Changes the log message to avoid way-too-long (and
	  truncated anyways) log messages * Adds a 'parsing' status flag to
	  Response: Success * Sets parsing = MESSAGE_LINE_TOO_LONG if,
	  well, a line is too long * Responds with an appropriate error if
	  parsing != MESSAGE_OKAY (closes issue AST-961) Reported by: John

	* main/db.c, res/res_agi.c: Fix DBDelTree error codes for AMI, CLI

	  deleted successfully even if the given key does not exist. The

	  saved because it actually responded with '0 database entries
	  removed'. AGI had a slightly different error, where it would

	* res/res_jabber.c: Check for presence of buddy in info/dinfo
	  handlers The res_jabber resource module uses the ASTOBJ library
	  for managing its ref counted objects. After calling
	  ASTOBJ_CONTAINER_FIND to locate a buddy object, the pointer to
	  the object has to be checked to see if the buddy existed. Prior
	  to this patch, the buddy object was not checked for NULL; with
	  this patch in both aji_client_info_handler and aji_dinfo_handler
	  the pointer is checked before used and, if no buddy object was
	  found, the handlers return an error code. This patch does not
	  take the approach that our JID can be used to log in from another
	  resource. If that approach is desired, an improvement could be
	  made to this patch to create the buddy on the fly. This patch
	  seeks only to prevent Asterisk from crashing. Note that multiple
	  people have proposed patches for this issue; the patch being
	  committed here is based on those. (closes issue ASTERISK-19532)

	  loading of long member lists. Greenlight in #asterisk brought up
	  that he was receiving an error message "Could not create
	  persistent member string, out of space" when running app_queue in
	  Asterisk 10. dump_queue_members() made an assumption that 8K
	  would be enough to store the generated string, but with queues
	  that have large member lists this is not always the case. This
	  patch removes the limitation and uses ast_str instead of a fixed
	  sized buffer. The complicating factor comes from the fact that
	  ast_db_get requires a buffer and buffer size argument, which
	  doesn't let us pull back more than what we pass in, so I
	  introduced a new ast_db_get_allocated() which returns an
	  ast_strdup()'d copy of the value from astdb. As an aside, I did
	  some testing on the maximum size of data that we can store in the
	  BDB library we distribute and was able to store a 10MB string and
	  retrieve it with no problems, so I feel this is a safe patch.

	  linking the module via load_dynamic_module() but was not adding

	  initialized based on it's priority along with the other modules
	  in the heap. Now use load_resource() instead of
	  load_dynamic_module() for non-optional requirement. This will add
	  the module to the resource_heap so the module can be properly
	  initialized in the correct order. This is required if there are
	  any module global data structures initialized in the .load()
	  callback for the module on platforms which do not support weak

	  reality it did not. When sending RTP packets via multicast the
	  amount of data sent is stored in a variable and returned from the
	  write function. This is incorrect as any non-zero value returned
	  is considered a failure while a return value of 0 is success. For
	  callers (such as ast_streamfile) that checked the return value
	  they would have considered it a failure when in reality nothing
	  went wrong and it was actually a success. The write function for
	  the multicast RTP engine now returns -1 on failure and 0 on
	  success, as it should. (closes issue ASTERISK-17254) Reported by:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a deadlock caused by a race condition
	  between removing a hint and reloading the dialplan and
	  subscribing to the removed hint. If conditions were right it was
	  possible for both the PBX core and chan_sip to deadlock by both
	  having a lock that the other wants. In the case of the PBX core
	  it had the contexts lock and wanted a SIP dialog lock, while in
	  the case of chan_sip it had the SIP dialog lock and wanted the
	  contexts lock. This fix unlocks the SIP dialog before getting the
	  extension state so that the other thread will not block on trying
	  to lock it. Once the extension state is retrieved the SIP dialog
	  is locked again and life carries on. As the SIP dialog is
	  reference counted it is not possible for it to go away after
	  unlocking. (closes issue ASTERISK-20437) Reported by: jhutchins

	* main/ssl.c, main/tcptls.c, channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve memory
	  leaks in TLS initialization and TLS client connections This patch
	  resolves two sources of memory leaks when using TLS in Asterisk:
	  1) It removes improper initialization (and multiple
	  re-initializations) of portions of the SSL library. Asterisk
	  calls SSL_library_init and SSL_load_error_strings during SSL
	  initialization; collectively this obviates the need for calling
	  any of the following during initialization or client connection
	  handling: * ERR_load_crypto_strings (handled by
	  SSL_load_error_strings) * OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms (synonym for
	  SSL_library_init) * SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms (synonym for
	  SSL_library_init) 2) Failure to completely clean up all memory
	  allocated by Asterisk and by the SSL library for TLS clients.
	  This included not freeing the SSL_CTX object in the SIP channel
	  driver, as well as not clearing the error stack when the TLS
	  client exited. Note that these memory leaks were found by Thomas
	  Arimont, and this patch was essentially written by him with some

	* channels/sip/sdp_crypto.c: Only re-create an SRTP session when
	  needed; respond with correct crypto policy In r356604, SRTP
	  handling was fixed to accomodate multiple crypto keys in an SDP
	  offer and the ability to re-create an SRTP session when the
	  crypto keys changed. In certain circumstances - most notably when
	  a phone is put on hold after having been bridged for a
	  significant amount of time - the act of re-creating the SRTP
	  session causes problems for certain models of phones. The patch
	  committed in r356604 always re-created the SRTP session
	  regardless of whether or not the cryptographic keys changed.
	  Since this is technically not necessary, this patch modifies the
	  behavior to only re-create the SRTP session if Asterisk detects
	  that the remote key has changed. This allows models of phones
	  that do not handle the SRTP session changing to continue to work,
	  while also providing the behavior needed for those phones that do
	  re-negotiate cryptographic keys. In addition, in Asterisk 1.8
	  only, it was found that phones that offer AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32
	  will end up with no audio if the phone is the initiator of the
	  call. The phone will send an INVITE request specifying that
	  AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 be used for the cryptographic policy;
	  Asterisk will set its policy to that value. Unfortunately, when
	  the call is Answered and a 200 OK is sent back to the UA, the
	  policy sent in the response's SDP will be the hard coded value
	  AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80. This potentially results in Asterisk
	  using the INVITE request's policy of AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32,
	  while the phone uses Asterisk's response of
	  AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80. Hilarity ensues as both endpoints think
	  the other is crazy. This patch fixes that by caching the policy
	  from the request and responding with it. Note that this is not a
	  problem in Asterisk 10 and later, as the ability to configure the
	  policy was added in that version. (issue ASTERISK-20194) Reported

	  The inboxcount2 function uses find_user in such a fashion when
	  counting new messages, and fails to free the resulting voicemail
	  user object. 2. When populate_defaults is called on a voicemail
	  user, it wipes whatever flags have been set on the object by
	  copying over the global flags object. If the VM_ALLOCED flag was
	  ste on the voicemail user prior to doing so, that flag is

	* apps/app_queue.c: Prevent crash on shutdown due to refcount error
	  on queues container. When app_queue is unloaded, the queues

	* main/manager.c, README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt: AST-2012-012:
	  Resolve AMI User Unauthorized Shell Access through ExternalIVR
	  The AMI Originate action can allow a remote user to specify
	  information that can be used to execute shell commands on the
	  system hosting Asterisk. This can result in an unwanted
	  escalation of permissions, as the Originate action, which
	  requires the "originate" class authorization, can be used to
	  perform actions that would typically require the "system" class
	  authorization. Previous attempts to prevent this permission
	  escalation (AST-2011-006, AST-2012-004) have sought to do so by
	  inspecting the names of applications and functions passed in with
	  the Originate action and, if those applications/functions matched
	  a predefined set of values, rejecting the command if the user
	  lacked the "system" class authorization. As noted by IBM X-Force
	  Research, the "ExternalIVR" application is not listed in the
	  predefined set of values. The solution for this particular
	  vulnerability is to include the "ExternalIVR" application in the
	  set of defined applications/functions that require "system" class
	  authorization. Unfortunately, the approach of inspecting fields
	  in the Originate action against known applications/functions has
	  a significant flaw. The predefined set of values can be bypassed
	  by creative use of the Originate action or by certain dialplan
	  configurations, which is beyond the ability of Asterisk to
	  analyze at run-time. Attempting to work around these scenarios
	  would result in severely restricting the applications or
	  functions and prevent their usage for legitimate means. As such,
	  any additional security vulnerabilities, where an
	  application/function that would normally require the "system"
	  class authorization can be executed by users with the "originate"
	  class authorization, will not be addressed. Instead, the
	  README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file has been updated to
	  reflect that the AMI Originate action can result in commands
	  requiring the "system" class authorization to be executed. Proper
	  system configuration can limit the impact of such scenarios.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample, channels/sip/include/sip.h,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: Help mitigate potential reinvite glare
	  scenarios. When Asterisk servers are set up back-to-back, and
	  direct media is to be used betweeen endpoints, it is fairly
	  common for the two Asterisk servers to send direct media
	  reinvites to each other simultaneously. This results in 491s and
	  ACKs being exchanged between the servers. While the media
	  eventually gets set up properly, the problem is that there can be
	  a noticeable delay for the streams to stabilize. This patch adds
	  a new directmedia option called "outgoing". With this set, an
	  immediate direct media reinvite will only be sent if the call
	  direction is outgoing. For incoming dialogs, an immediate direct
	  media reinvite will not be sent, but further "reactionary" direct
	  media reinvites may be sent. For those who are having some deja
	  vu, that's because this patch was originally committed to trunk
	  since there is a new configuration option added. After seeing a
	  bug report about audio being slow to set up on SIP calls, it
	  became apparent that this patch would be the best solution for
	  resolving the issue. The patch is unintrusive and will have no
	  effect unless the option is explicitly enabled. (closes issue

	* r372709: Only re-create an SRTP session when needed; respond with
	  correct crypto policy

	  In r356604, SRTP handling was fixed to accomodate multiple crypto
	  keys in an SDP offer and the ability to re-create an SRTP session
	  when the crypto keys changed. In certain circumstances - most
	  notably when a phone is put on hold after having been bridged for a
	  significant amount of time - the act of re-creating the SRTP session
	  causes problems for certain models of	phones.	The patch committed in
	  r356604 always re-created the SRTP session regardless	of whether or
	  not the cryptographic keys changed. Since this is technically
	  not necessary, this patch modifies the behavior to only re-create the
	  SRTP session if Asterisk detects that the remote key has changed.
	  This allows models of phones that do not handle the SRTP session
	  changing to continue to work, while also providing the behavior
	  needed for those phones that do re-negotiate cryptographic keys.

	  In addition, in Asterisk 1.8 only, it was found that phones that
	  offer	AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 will end up with no audio if the phone
	  is the initiator of the call. The phone will send an INVITE request
	  specifying that AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 be used for the cryptographic
	  policy; Asterisk will set its policy to that value. Unfortunately,
	  when the call is Answered and a 200 OK is sent back to the UA, the
	  policy sent in the response's SDP will be the hard coded value
	  AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80. This potentially results in Asterisk using
	  the INVITE request's policy of AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32, while the
	  phone uses Asterisk's response of AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80. Hilarity
	  ensues as both endpoints think the other is crazy.

	  This patch fixes that by caching the policy from the request and
	  responding with it. Note that this is not a problem in Asterisk 10
	  and later, as	the ability to configure the policy was added in that
	  version.

	* r372840: Fix bad channel application data reference.

	  When channels get bridged due to an AMI bridge action
	  or a DTMF attended transfer, the two channels that
	  get bridged have their application data pointing to
	  the other channel's name. This means that if one channel
	  is hung up but the other moves on, it means that the
	  channel that moves on will have its application data

	  ast_free is defined as free. With MALLOC_DEBUG enabled, however,
	  ast_free takes on a definition from a different place then
	  utils.h, and became undefined. This patch resolves this by using
	  a reference to ast_free_ptr. When MALLOC_DEBUG is enabled, this
	  calls ast_free; when MALLOC_DEBUG is not enabled, this is defined
	  to be ast_free, which is defined to be free. (issue AST-916)

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: Handle extremely out of order RFC 2833
	  DTMF The current implementation of RFC 2833 DTMF handling in
	  res_rtp_asterisk will, if a packet arrives out of order, drop the
	  packet. This is to prevent duplicate ton generation in the
	  Asterisk core. Since the RTP layer does not buffer data itself,
	  this is the only option the RTP layer currently has for handling
	  packets that arrive out of order. For the most part, this doesn't
	  matter. For a particular digit, so long as a BEGIN packet arrives
	  before the first END packet, the digit will be produced. If
	  subsequent BEGIN packets arrive interleaved with the ENDs, they
	  will be dropped; likewise, if the BEGIN or END packets themselves
	  are out of order, those packets are dropped but sufficient
	  information is conveyed to the Asterisk core to produce the
	  appropriate digit. For certain sequences of DTMF packets - most
	  notably when, for a particular digit, an END packet arrives
	  before any BEGIN packet for that digit - this is a real problem.
	  When an END arrives before any BEGINs, the END packet is dropped
	  - but at the same time, it causes subsequent BEGIN packets for
	  that digit to be ignored. When the next in order END packet
	  arrives, it too is dropped - Asterisk believes that there was no
	  initial BEGIN. The solution this patch provides is to trust the
	  END packet to convey the information needed for the Asterisk core
	  to produce the DTMF digit. If we receive an END packet, and it: *
	  Has a timestamp greater then the last timestamp received from an
	  END packet * Does not have the same sequence number as the last
	  received sequence number (and is thus not an END packet
	  retransmission) Then we send the END frame up to the Asterisk
	  core. It contains enough DTMF information for Asterisk to produce
	  the digit. On the other hand, if we receive a BEGIN or
	  continuation packet that occurs with a timestamp equal to or less
	  then the last END timestamp, then we've received something out of
	  order - but we already have received enough information to
	  produce the digit. These packets are dropped. Much thanks goes to
	  Olle Johansson (oej) for providing the idea for this solution.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Do not send a BYE when a provisional
	  response arrives during a re-INVITE Commits r369557 and r369579
	  were done to improve handling of re-INVITEs when the UA that was
	  supposed to receive the re-INVITE fails to respond. A limitation
	  of those patches occurred when a UA sent a provisional response
	  to the re-INVITE. This triggered a sending of a BYE in
	  check_pending. This patch tweaks the handling of the re-INVITE
	  such that a BYE is not sent in response to those messages. (issue

	  Clean up after a reinvite that never gets a final response The
	  basic problem is that if a re-INVITE is sent by Asterisk and it
	  receives a provisional response, but no final response, then the
	  dialog is never torn down. In addition to leaking memory, this
	  also leaks file descriptors and will eventually lead to Asterisk
	  no longer being able to process calls. This patch just keeps
	  track of whether there is an outstanding re-INVITE, and if there
	  is goes ahead and cleans up everything as though there was no
	  outstanding reinvite. Review:

	* main/adsi.c: Fix crash in unloading of res_adsi module When
	  res_adsi is unloaded, it removes the ADSI functions that it
	  previously installed by passing a NULL adsi_funcs pointer to
	  ast_adsi_install_funcs. This function was not checking whether or
	  not the adsi_funcs pointer passed in was NULL before
	  dereferencing it to check whether or not the version of the
	  functions matches what the core was expecting it. This patch
	  makes it so that the version is only checked if a potentially
	  valid adsi_funcs pointer was passed in. Passing in NULL removes
	  the installed functions, bypassing the version check.

	* main/cdr.c: Tweak CDR change in r369351 As Tilghman pointed out

	* main/cdr.c: Fix incorrect duration reporting in CDRs created in
	  batch mode Certain places in core/cdr.c would, if the duration
	  value were 0, calculate the duration as being the delta between
	  the current time and the time at which the CDR record was
	  started. While this does not typically cause a problem in
	  non-batch mode, this can cause an issue in batch mode where CDR
	  records are gathered and written long after those calls have
	  ended. In particular, this affects calls that were never
	  answered, as those are expected to have a duration of 0. Often,
	  this would result in CDR logs with a significant number of calls
	  with lengthy durations, but dispositions of "BUSY". Note that
	  this does not affect cdr_csv, as that backend does not use
	  ast_cdr_getvar and instead directly reports the duration value.
	  The affected core backends include cdr_apative_odbc and
	  cdr_custom; other extended or deprecated CDR backends may
	  potentially still directly manipulate the duration values. (issue

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a specific scenario where ACKs are not
	  matched. If a dialog-starting INVITE contains a to-tag, then
	  Asterisk will respond with a 481. In this case, the resulting
	  incoming ACK would not be matched, so Asterisk would continue
	  retransmitting the 481 until the transaction times out. There
	  were two issues. Asterisk, upon creating a sip_pvt would generate
	  a local tag. However, when the time came to transmit the 481,
	  since there was a to-tag in the INVITE, Asterisk would place this
	  original to-tag in the 481 response. When the ACK came in,
	  Asterisk would attempt to match the to-tag in the ACK to the
	  generated local tag. Unfortunately, Asterisk never actually
	  transmitted a response with the generated local tag, so the
	  to-tag in the ACK would not match. The other problem was that
	  when the 481 was sent, nothing was set on the sip_pvt to indicate
	  what CSeq is expected in the ACK. To fix the first problem, we
	  zero out the to-tag seen in the incoming INVITE. This way,
	  Asterisk, when time to send a response, will send its generated
	  local tag instead. To fix the second problem, we set the
	  sip_pvt's pendinginvite to the CSeq of the INVITE when we send a
	  481. (closes issue ASTERISK-19892) Reported by Mark Michelson

	* build_tools/make_version: Add feature modifier to versions
	  produced from branches Certain branches, such as Certified
	  Asterisk, may have a modifier added to them that specifies the
	  features available in that branch. For branches, this modifier is
	  expected to be reflected in the location of the branch in
	  subversion. For example, a subversion of URL of
	  /certified/branches/1.8.11 would have a feature modifier of
	  'certified'. This is slightly different then how features are
	  determined for tags, where the feature is part of the actual tag
	  name, e.g., "10.5.0-digiumphones". In keeping with the
	  nomenclature used for tags, the feature specifier for branches is
	  translated and placed after the revision numbers. For the example
	  given previously, this would result in a branch version of
	  "Asterisk SVN-branch-1.8.11-cert-rXXXXXX".

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Update a peer's LastMsgsSent when the peer
	  is notified of waiting messages Previously, MWI logic utilized a

	  requests had been sent to a specific peer. When MWI notifications
	  were changed to use the internal event framework, this value was
	  no longer needed for its original purpose. Hence, it was no
	  longer updated with the new/old message counts for a peer.
	  However, the value was still presented when, either by AMI or
	  CLI, a 'sip show peer [peer]' command was executed. The output of
	  the command would always display the erroneous value of
	  32767/65535 for 'LastMsgsSent'. This patch makes it so that the
	  value of lastmsgssent is updated appropriately. The value should
	  now display the new/old message counts for a particular peer.

	  main/channel.c, include/asterisk/cel.h: Fix race condition for
	  CEL LINKEDID_END event This patch fixes to situations that could
	  cause the CEL LINKEDID_END event to be missed. 1) During a core
	  stop gracefully, modules are unloaded when ast_active_channels ==
	  0. The LINKDEDID_END event fires during the channel destructor.
	  This means that occasionally, the cel_* module will be unloaded
	  before the channel is destroyed. It seemed generally useful to
	  wait until the refcount of all channels == 0 before unloading, so
	  I added a channel counter and used it in the shutdown code. 2)
	  During a masquerade, ast_channel_change_linkedid is called. It
	  calls ast_cel_check_retire_linkedid which unrefs the linkedid in
	  the linkedids container in cel.c. It didn't ref the new linkedid.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix broken reinvite glare scenario. To make
	  a long story short, reinvite glares were broken because Asterisk
	  would invert the To and From headers when ACKing a 491 response.
	  The reason was because the initreq of the dialog was being
	  changed to the incoming glared reinvite instead of being set to
	  the outgoing glared reinvite. This change has three parts * In
	  handle_incoming, we never will reject an ACK because it has a
	  to-tag present, even if we think the request may be out of
	  dialog. * In handle_request_invite, we do not change the initreq
	  when receiving a reinvite to which we will respond with a 491. *
	  In handle_request_invite, several superflous settings up
	  pendinginvite have been removed since this is dones automatically

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Prevent sip_pvt refleak when an ast_channel
	  outlasts its corresponding sip_pvt. chan_sip was coded under the
	  assumption that a SIP dialog with an owner channel will always be
	  destroyed after the owner channel has been hung up. However,
	  there are situations where the SIP dialog can time out and auto
	  destruct before the corresponding channel has hung up. A typical
	  example of this would be if the 'h' extension in the dialplan
	  takes a long time to complete. In such cases,
	  __sip_autodestruct() would complain about the dialog being auto
	  destroyed with an owner channel still in place. The problem is
	  that even once the owner channel was hung up, the sip_pvt would
	  still be linked in its ao2_container because nothing would ever
	  unlink it. The fix for this is that if __sip_autodestruct() is
	  called for a sip_pvt that still has an owner channel in place,
	  the destruction is rescheduled for 10 seconds in the future. This
	  will continue until the owner channel is finally hung up. (closes

	  is that we seed the remote target with the To header of the

	  calculated values before it returns. On 64-bit machines, this
	  might be the case, as a long may be 64-bits. On 32-bit machines,
	  however, a long may be less (32-bits), in which case, the
	  calculation can overflow. This overflow caused significant
	  problems in MixMonitor, which uses the method to determine if an
	  audio factory, which has not presented audio to an audiohook, is
	  merely late in providing said audio or will never provide audio.
	  In an overflow situation, the audiohook would incorrectly
	  determine that an audio factory that will never provide audio is
	  merely late instead. This led to situations where a MixMonitor
	  never recorded any audio. Note that this happened most frequently
	  when that MixMonitor was started by the ConfBridge application
	  itself, or when the MixMonitor was attached to a Local channel.

	  the same SIP dialog As a continuation of the patch in r356604,
	  which allowed for the reloading of SRTP keys in re-INVITE
	  transfer scenarios, this patch addresses the more common case
	  where a new key is requested within the context of a current SIP
	  dialog. This can occur, for example, when certain phones request
	  a SIP hold. Previously, once a dialog was associated with an SRTP
	  object, any subsequent attempt to process crypto keys in any SDP
	  offer - either the current one or a new offer in a new SIP
	  request - were ignored. This patch changes this behavior to only
	  ignore subsequent crypto keys within the current SDP offer, but
	  allows future SDP offers to change the keys. (issue

	  potential buffer overflows * chan_mobile: Fixed an overrun where
	  the cind_state buffer (an integer array of size 16) would be
	  overrun due to improper bounds checking. At worst, the buffer can
	  be overrun by a total of 48 bytes (assuming 4-byte integers),
	  which would still leave it within the allocated memory of struct
	  hfp. This would corrupt other elements in that struct but not
	  necessarily cause any further issues. * app_sms: The array imsg
	  is of size 250, while the array (ud) that the data is copied into
	  is of size 160. If the size of the inbound message is greater
	  then 160, up to 90 bytes could be overrun in ud. This would
	  corrupt the user data header (array udh) adjacent to ud. *
	  chan_unistim: A number of invalid memmoves are corrected. These
	  would move data (which may or may not be valid) into the ends of
	  these buffers. * asterisk: ast_console_toggle_loglevel does not
	  check that the console log level being set is less then or equal
	  to the allowed log levels of 32. * frame: In
	  ast_codec_pref_prepend, if any occurrence of the specified codec
	  is not found, the value used to index into the array pref->order
	  would be one greater then the maximum size of the array. *
	  jitterbuf: If the element being placed into the jitter buffer
	  lands in the last available slot in the jitter history buffer,
	  the insertion sort attempts to move the last entry in the buffer
	  into one slot past the maximum length of the buffer. Note that
	  this occurred for both the min and max jitter history buffers. *
	  tdd: If a read from fsk_serial returns a character that is
	  greater then 32, an attempt to read past one of the statically
	  defined arrays containing the values that character maps to would
	  occur. * localtime: struct ast_time and tm are not the same size
	  - ast_time is larger, although it contains the elements of tm
	  within it in the same layout. Hence, when using memcpy to copy
	  the contents of tm into ast_time, the size of tm should be used,
	  as opposed to the size of ast_time. * extconf: this treats
	  ast_timing's minmask array as if it had a length of 48, when it
	  has defined the size of the array as 24. pbx.h defines minmask as
	  having a size of 48. (issue ASTERISK-19668) Reported by: Matt

	  an invalid ao2 object or is NULL, the return value is passed
	  directly to strerror, which can only accept positive integer
	  values. In chan_dahdi, the return value of dahdi_get_index is
	  used to directly index into the sub-channel array. If
	  dahd_get_index returns a negative value, it would use that value
	  to index into the array, which could cause an invalid memory
	  access. If dahdi_get_index returns a negative number, we now
	  default to SUB_REAL. (issue ASTERISK-19655) Reported by: Matt

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix handling of negative return code when
	  storing voicemails in ODBC storage When storing a voicemail
	  message using an ODBC connection to a database, the voicemail
	  message is first stored on disk. The sound file associated with
	  the message is read into memory before being transmitted to the
	  database. When this occurs, a failure in the C library's lseek
	  function would cause a negative value to be passed to the mmap as
	  the size of the memory map to create. This would almost certainly
	  cause the creation of the memory map to fail, resulting in the
	  message being lost. (issue ASTERISK-19655) Reported by: Matt

	* main/http.c: Fix crash caused by unloading or reloading of
	  res_http_post When unlinking itself from the registered HTTP
	  URIs, res_http_post could inadvertently free all URIs registered

	  to only free the URI that is actually being unregistered, as
	  opposed to all of them.

	* funcs/func_curl.c: Allow func_curl to exit gracefully if list
	  allocation fails during write If the global_curl_info data
	  structure could not be allocated, the datastore associated with
	  the operation would be free'd, but the function would not return.
	  This would later dereference the datastore, almost certainly
	  causing Asterisk to crash. With this patch, if the data structure
	  is not allocated the method will return an error code, and not
	  attempt any further operation.

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c: Prevent invalid access of free'd memory if
	  DAHDI channel during an MWI event In the MWI processing loop,
	  when a valid event occurs the temporary caller ID information is

	  event is passed up to the analog_ss_thread without error and the
	  loop exits. If, however, the DAHDI channel is not created, then
	  the caller ID struct has been free'd, and the gains reset to
	  their previous level. This will almost certainly cause an invalid
	  access to the free'd memory, either in subsequent calls to
	  callerid_free or calls to callerid_feed. This patch makes it so
	  that we only free the caller ID structure if a DAHDI channel is
	  successfully created, and we bump the gains back up if we fail to
	  make a DAHDI channel.

	* funcs/func_global.c: Change SHARED function to use a safe
	  traversal when modifying a variable When the SHARED function
	  modifies a variable, it removes it from its list of variables and
	  reinserts the new value at the head of the list of variables.
	  Doing this inside a standard list traversal can be dangerous, as
	  the standard list traversal does not account for the list being
	  changed. While the code in question should not cause a use after
	  free violation due to its breaking out of the loop after freeing
	  the variable, it could lead to a maintenance issue if the loop
	  was modified. This also fixes a violation reported by a static
	  analysis tool, which also makes this code easier to maintain in
	  the future.

	  event email address node is empty If the XML calendar data

	  provided, a condition existed where an ast_calendar_attendee

	* main/features.c: Fix potential race condition during call pickup.
	  Prior to this patch, a connected line update was queued during
	  call pickup and then an answer frame was queued. The original
	  caller would presumably then have his connected line updated and
	  then the call would be answered. In actuality, the answer frame
	  was not how the call ended up being answered. Rather, an odd
	  section in app_dial that checks if the called channel's state is
	  up. The result is that the order of the connected line update and
	  the answer were variable. In most cases, this wasn't actually a
	  bad thing. However, if the 'I' option was passed to dial, the
	  connected line update would be inhibited. The fix is to queued
	  the connected line after the answer frame is queued. This way the
	  race in app_dial is between two conditions resulting in an
	  answer. This way the connected line update occurs after the
	  answer every time. (closes issue ASTERISK-19183) Reported by:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure Asterisk sends a BYE when pending on

	  the callback re-entrantly. There is no way to guarantee a module
	  unload will not crash because of an active callback. The code
	  attempts to minimize the chance with the registered flag and the
	  maximum 5 second delay before ast_manager_unregister() returns.
	  The trunk version of the patch changes the API to fix the race
	  condition correctly to prevent the module code from unloading
	  from memory while an action callback is active. * Don't hold the
	  lock while calling the AMI action callback. (closes issue

	* main/utils.c: Fix remotely exploitable stack overflow in HTTP
	  manager There exists a remotely exploitable stack buffer overflow
	  in HTTP digest authentication handling in Asterisk. The
	  particular method in question is only utilized by HTTP AMI. When
	  parsing the digest information, the length of the string is not
	  checked when it is copied into temporary buffers allocated on the
	  stack. This patch fixes this behavior by parsing out pre-defined

	* main/jitterbuf.c: Fix incorrect jitter buffer overflow due to
	  missed resynchronizations When a change in time occurs, such that
	  the timestamps associated with frames being placed into an
	  adaptive jitter buffer (implemented in jitterbuf.c) are
	  significantly different then the previously inserted frames, the
	  jitter buffer checks to see if it needs to be resynched to the
	  new time frame. If three consecutive packets break the threshold,
	  the jitter buffer resynchs itself to the new timestamps. This
	  currently only occurs when history is calculated, and hence only
	  on JB_TYPE_VOICE frames. JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames, on the other
	  hand, are never passed to the history calculations. Because of
	  this, if the jump in time is greater then the maximum allowed
	  length of the jitter buffer, the JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames are
	  dropped and no resynchronization occurs. Alterntively, if the
	  overfill logic is not triggered, the JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame will
	  be placed into the buffer, but with a time reference that is not
	  applicable. Subsequent JB_TYPE_VOICE frames will quickly trigger
	  the overflow logic until reads from the jitter buffer reach the
	  errant JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame. This patch allows JB_TYPE_CONTROL
	  frames to resynch the jitter buffer. As JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames
	  are unlikely to occur in multiples, it perform the
	  resynchronization on any JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame that breaks the
	  resynch threshold. Note that this only impacts chan_iax2, as
	  other consumers of the adaptive jitter buffer use the abstract
	  jitter buffer API, which does not use JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames.

	* include/asterisk/logger.h, main/logger.c: Fix bogus reads/writes
	  of console log levels in asterisk.c This patch updates the
	  NUMLOGLEVELS define in logger.h to 32, to match the fact that
	  logger.c implements 32 log levels (because of the custom log
	  level stuff). asterisk.c uses this define to size an array of
	  levels per remote console. This array is modified in
	  ast_console_toggle_loglevel(), which is called by the "logger set
	  level" CLI command. While the documentation for the CLI command
	  doesn't make it terribly obvious, you can use this CLI command to
	  toggle a custom log level on a remote console, as well. However,
	  doing so led to an invalid array index in asterisk.c. This array
	  is read from any time a log message is written to a console. So,
	  all custom log level messages resulted in a bogus read if a
	  remote console was connected.

	* apps/app_externalivr.c, channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix invalid
	  reads/writes due to incorrect sizeof(). These few places in the
	  code used sizeof() on h_addr in struct hostent. This is
	  sizeof(char *). The correct way to get the size of this address
	  is to use h_length. This error would result in reads/writes of 8
	  bytes instead of 4 on 64-bit machines.

	* main/sched.c: Fix inaccurate sizeof() in sched.c. This code just
	  needed sizeof(int), not sizeof(int *).

	* utils/astman.c: Fix incorrect sizeof() in astman.

	* res/res_crypto.c: Fix incorrect usage of sizeof() in res_crypto.

	* res/res_adsi.c: Fix broken usage of sizeof() in res_adsi.

	* main/features.c: Fix incorrect sizeof() usage in features.c. This
	  didn't actually result in a bug anywhere, luckily. The only place
	  where the result of these memcpys was used is in app_dial, and
	  the only field that it read out of ast_call_feature was the first
	  one, which is an int, so these memcpys always copied just enough

	* UPGRADE.txt, CHANGES: Requested changes documenting the fixed AEL
	  functionality.

	* utils/ael_main.c, apps/app_stack.c, utils/conf2ael.c,
	  res/ael/pval.c, funcs/func_dialplan.c, tests/test_gosub.c: Enable
	  macros in 1.8 to find the next highest "h" extension in a
	  context, like in 1.4. This change restores functionality that was
	  present in 1.4, when AEL macros were implemented with the Macro
	  dialplan application. Macros are fraught with functionality
	  issues, because they consume a large portion of the underlying
	  application stack. This limits the ability of AEL users to call
	  many layers of subroutines, an issue which Gosub does not have
	  (originally tested to 100,000 levels deep). Therefore, starting
	  in 1.6.0, AEL macros were implemented with Gosub. However, there
	  were some implicit behaviors of Macro, which were not replicated
	  at the same time as with the transition to Gosub, one of which is
	  documented in the related issue. In particular, the "h" extension
	  is designed to execute not in the Macro context, but in the
	  topmost calling context. Due to legacy issues with a misapplied
	  bugfix many years ago, when a macro exited in 1.4, it looks in
	  all calling contexts, bubbling up from the deepest level until it
	  finds an "h" extension. Since AEL hides the complexity of the
	  underlying dialplan logic from the AEL programmer, it's
	  reasonable to assume that this behavior should not change in the
	  transition from Asterisk 1.4 LTS to Asterisk 1.8 LTS, lest we
	  break working AEL configurations in the transition to Asterisk
	  1.8 LTS. This fix is the result, which implements a search for
	  the "h" extension in all calling Gosub contexts. Fixes

	* main/channel.c: Fix race condition that can cause important

	  actions. 1. Move the reading of the alertpipe in __ast_read() to
	  immediately before the removal of frames from the readq. This
	  means we won't do something silly like read from the alertpipe,
	  then ignore the fact that there's a frame to get from the readq
	  since channel's fdno is the AST_TIMING_FD. 2. When
	  ast_settimeout() sets the rate to 0 and the timingfunc to NULL,
	  if the channel's fdno is the AST_TIMING_FD, then set the fdno to
	  -1. This is because if the rate is 0 and the timingfunc is NULL,
	  it means that the channel's timing fd is being invalidated, so
	  any pending reads should not occur. This may actually solve more

	  regression by allowing AMI action callback to be reentrant

	  Fix AMI module reload deadlock from ASTERISK-18479 when it tried
	  to fix the race between calling an AMI action callback and
	  unregistering that action.  Refixes ASTERISK-13784 broken by
	  ASTERISK-17785 change.

	  Locking the ao2 object guaranteed that there were no active
	  callbacks that mattered when ast_manager_unregister() was called.
	  Unfortunately, this causes the deadlock situation.  The patch stops
	  locking the ao2 object to allow multiple threads to invoke the
	  callback re-entrantly.  There is no way to guarantee a module unload
	  will not crash because of an active callback.  The code attempts to
	  minimize the chance with the registered flag and the maximum 5
	  second delay before ast_manager_unregister() returns.

	  The trunk version of the patch changes the API to fix the race
	  condition correctly to prevent the module code from unloading from
	  memory while an action callback is active.

	* include/asterisk/dnsmgr.h, main/dnsmgr.c, channels/chan_sip.c:
	  Re-link peers by IP when dnsmgr changes the IP Asterisk's dnsmgr
	  currently takes a pointer to an ast_sockaddr and updates it
	  anytime an address resolves to something different. There are a
	  couple of issues with this. First, the ast_sockaddr is usually
	  the address of an ast_sockaddr inside a refcounted struct and we
	  never bump the refcount of those structs when using dnsmgr. This
	  makes it possible that a refresh could happen after the
	  destructor for that object is called (despite ast_dnsmgr_release
	  being called in that destructor). Second, the module using dnsmgr
	  cannot be aware of an address changing without polling for it in
	  the code. If an action needs to be taken on address update (like
	  re-linking a SIP peer in the peers_by_ip table), then polling for
	  this change negates many of the benefits of having dnsmgr in the
	  first place. This patch adds a function to the dnsmgr API that
	  calls an update callback instead of blindly updating the address
	  itself. It also moves calls to ast_dnsmgr_release outside of the
	  destructor functions and into cleanup functions that are called
	  when we no longer need the objects and increments the refcount of
	  the objects using dnsmgr since those objects are stored on the
	  ast_dnsmgr_entry struct. A helper function for returning the
	  proper default SIP port (non-tls vs tls) is also added and used.
	  This patch also incorporates changes from a patch posted by Timo
	  Teräs to ASTERISK-19106 for related dnsmgr issues. (closes issue

	  otherwise be interpreted as the start of a comment. The change
	  here causes that backslash to be removed, but does not create a
	  real escape system in the config parser. The biggest complication
	  with a real escape system would be breaking existing configs
	  everywhere (parsing \\ as \ and breaking on escaped non-semicolon
	  characters) even though it would be the "right" way to do things.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix potential buffer overrun and memory leak
	  when executing "sip show peers" The "sip show peers" command uses
	  a fix sized array to sort the current peers in the peers
	  ao2_container. The size of the array is based on the current
	  number of peers in the container. However, once the size of the
	  array is determined, the number of peers in the container can
	  change, as the peers container is not locked. This could cause a
	  buffer overrun when populating the array, if peers were added to
	  the container after the array was created. Additionally, a memory
	  leak of the allocated array would occur if a user caused the
	  _show_peers method to return CLI_SHOWUSAGE. We now create a
	  snapshot of the current peers using an ao2_callback with the
	  OBJ_MULTIPLE flag. This size of the array is set to the number of
	  peers that the iterator will iterate over; hence, if peers are
	  added or removed from the peers container it will not affect the
	  execution of the "sip show peers" command. Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix ACK routing for non-2xx responses. When
	  we send an ACK for a 2xx response to an INVITE, we are supposed
	  to use the learned route set. However, when we receive a non-2xx
	  final response to an INVITE, we are supposed to send the ACK to
	  the same place we initially sent the INVITE. We had been doing
	  this up until the changes went in that would build a route set
	  from provisional responses. That introduced a regression where we
	  would use the learned route set under all circumstances. With
	  this change, we now will set the destination of our ACK based on
	  the invitestate. If it is INV_COMPLETED then that means that we
	  have received a non-2xx final response (INV_TERMINATED indicates
	  a 2xx response was received). If it is INV_CANCELLED, then that
	  means the call is being canceled, which means that we should be
	  ACKing a 487 response. The other change introduced here is
	  setting the invitestate to INV_CONFIRMED when we send an ACK
	  *after* the reqprep instead of before. This way, we can tell in
	  reqprep more easily what the invitestate is prior to sending the
	  ACK. (closes issue ASTERISK-19389) reported by Karsten Wemheuer

	  These custom parking extensions will not be recognized as parking

	  is not recognized as a parking extension, the normal blind
	  transfer code causes the transferred channel to start executing

	  endpoint negotiated a new cryptographic key, is instead rejected
	  in res_srtp. This happens in particular in transfer scenarios,
	  where the endpoint that Asterisk is communicating with changes
	  but uses the same RTP session. This patch modifies res_srtp to
	  allow remote and local policies to be reloaded in the underlying
	  SRTP library. From the perspective of users of the SRTP API, the
	  only change is that the adding of remote and local policies are
	  now added in a single method call, whereas they previously were

	* main/acl.c: Prevent outbound SIP NOTIFY packets from displaying
	  a port of 0.

	  In the change from 1.6.2 to 1.8, ast_sockaddr was introduced which
	  changed the behavior of ast_find_ourip such that port number was
	  wiped out.  This caused the port in internip (which is used for
	  Contact and Call-ID on NOTIFYs) to be 0.  This change causes
	  ast_find_ourip to be port-preserving again.

	* Asterisk 1.8.10.0-rc3 Released.

	* main/channel.c: Fix callerid of Originated calls.

	  The callerid of originated calls (independent of mechanism) was not
	  being passed to the outbound channel.  This patch fixes that.  Thanks
	  to Matt Riddell for tracking this down.
	  (closes issue ASTERISK-19385)
	  Reported by: ornix

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix ACK routing for non-2xx responses.

	  When we send an ACK for a 2xx response to an INVITE, we are supposed
	  to use the learned route set. However, when we receive a non-2xx
	  final response to an INVITE, we are supposed to send the ACK to the
	  same place we initially sent the INVITE.

	  We had been doing this up until the changes went in that would build
	  a route set from provisional responses. That introduced a regression
	  where we would use the learned route set under all circumstances.

	  With this change, we now will set the destination of our ACK based on
	  the invitestate. If it is INV_COMPLETED then that means that we have
	  received a non-2xx final response (INV_TERMINATED indicates a 2xx
	  response was received).  If it is INV_CANCELLED, then that means the
	  call is being canceled, which means that we should be ACKing a 487
	  response.

	  The other change introduced here is setting the invitestate to
	  INV_CONFIRMED when we send an ACK *after* the reqprep instead of
	  before. This way, we can tell in reqprep more easily what the
	  invitestate is prior to sending the ACK.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix regressions with regards to route-set
	  creation on early dialogs.

	  This fixes two main issues:
	  1. Asterisk would send a CANCEL to the route created by the provisional
	     response instead of using the same destination it did in the initial
	     INVITE.
	  2. If a new route set arrives in a 200 OK than was in the 1XX response
	     (perfectly possible if our outbound INVITE gets forked), then the
	     route set in the 200 OK needs to overwrite the route set in the 1XX
	     response.

	* Asterisk 1.8.10.0-rc2 Released.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix SIP INFO DTMF handling for non-numeric
	  codes. In ASTERISK-18924, SIP INFO DTMF handling was changed to
	  account for both lowercase alphatbetic DTMF events, as well as
	  uppercase alphabetic DTMF events.  When this occurred, the comparison
	  of the character buffer containing the event code was changed such
	  that the buffer was first compared against '0' and '9' to determine if
	  it was numeric.  Unfortunately, since the first character in the
	  buffer will typically be '1' in the case of non-numeric event codes
	  (10-16), this caused those codes to be converted to a DTMF event of
	  '1'.  This patch fixes that, and cleans up handling of both
	  application/dtmf-relay and application/dtmf content types.

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fixes deadlocks occuring in chan_agent due to

	  addresses the bad locking order by releasing locks before getting the
	  right locking order to stop deadlocks from occuring when doing
	  multiple interactions with agents. (closes issue ASTERISK-19285)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure entering T.38 passthrough does not cause
	  an infinite loop. After R340970 Asterisk was still polling the RTCP
	  file descriptor after RTCP is shut down and removed. If the
	  descriptor happened to have data ready when the removal occured then
	  Asterisk would go into an infinite loop trying to read data that it
	  can never actually access. This change disables the audio RTCP file
	  descriptor for the duration of the T.38 transaction. (closes issue
	  ASTERISK-18951) Reported-by: Kristijan Vrban

	* channels/chan_sip.c,include/asterisk/dnsmgr.h,main/dnsmgr.c: Re-link
	  peers by IP when dnsmgr changes the IP  Asterisk's dnsmgr currently
	  takes a pointer to an ast_sockaddr and updates it anytime an address
	  resolves to something different. There are a couple of issues with
	  this. First, the ast_sockaddr is usually the address of an ast_sockaddr
	  inside a refcounted struct and we never bump the refcount of those
	  structs when using dnsmgr. This makes it possible that a refresh could
	  happen after the destructor for that object is called (despite 
	  ast_dnsmgr_release being called in that destructor). Second, the
	  module using dnsmgr cannot be aware of an address changing without
	  polling for it in the code. If an action needs to be taken on address
	  update (like re-linking a SIP peer in the peers_by_ip table), then
	  polling for this change negates many of the benefits of having dnsmgr
	  in the first place.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Clarify log WARNING message when port-zero
	  SDP 'm' lines received. Previously, if an m-line in an SDP offer
	  or answer had a port number of zero, that line was skipped, and
	  resulted in an 'Unsupported SDP media type...' warning message.
	  This was misleading, as the media type was not unsupported, but
	  was ignored because the m-line indicated that the media stream
	  had been rejected (in an answer) or was not going to be used (in
	  an offer).

	* main/netsock.c: Find even more network interfaces. The previous
	  change made the code look for emN and pciN in addition to what it
	  did originally, which was search for ethN. However, it needed to
	  be looking for pciN#N, so that's what it does now. This also
	  moves the memset() to be before every ioctl().

	  set in initialize_udptl or in sip_new to account for this

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add some missing locking in chan_sip. This
	  patch adds some missing locking to the function
	  send_provisional_keepalive_full(). This function is called from
	  the scheduler, which is processed in the SIP monitor thread. The
	  associated channel (or pbx) thread will also be using the same
	  sip_pvt and ast_channel so locking must be used. The
	  sip_pvt_lock_full() function is used to ensure proper locking
	  order in a safe manner. In passing, document a suspected
	  reference counting error in this function. The "fix" is left
	  commented out because when the "fix" is present, crashes occur.
	  My theory is that fixing it is exposing a reference counting
	  error elsewhere, but I don't know where. (Or my analysis of this
	  being a problem could have been completely wrong in the first
	  place). Leave the comment in the code for so that someone may
	  investigate it again in the future. Also add a bit of doxygen to
	  transmit_provisional_response(). (closes issue ASTERISK-18979)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure ACK retransmit & hangup on non-200
	  response to INVITE When handling a non-2xx final response on an
	  INVITE transaction, we have to keep the transaction around after
	  we send an ACK in case we receive a retransmission of the
	  response so we can re-transmit the ACK, but also tear down the
	  ast_channel as soon as we transmit the ACK. Before this patch, we
	  could fail at both of these things. Calling
	  sip_alreadygone/needdestroy prevented us from keeping the
	  transaction up and retransmitting the ACK, and queueing
	  CONGESTION was not sufficient to cause the channel to be torn
	  down when originating calls via the CLI, for example. This patch
	  queues a hangup with CONGESTION instead of just queueing
	  CONGESTION for these responses and removes the sip_alreadygone
	  and sip_needdestroy calls from handle_response_invite on non-2xx
	  responses. It relies on the hangup calling sip_scheddestroy. For
	  more information, see section 17.1.1.1 of RFC 3261. (closes issue

	  the SIP session timer expires after half the time the sip
	  endpoint indicates in the Session-expires header in
	  proc_session_timer(). The session timer was being stopped totally
	  and being handled as an error case instead of running again until
	  the second expiry. This patch treats the half-time expiry as a
	  non-error case and continues the timer until the true expiry.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Create and initialize udptl only when dialog
	  negotiates for image media Prior to this patch, the udptl struct
	  was allocated and initialized when a dialog was associated with a
	  peer that supported T.38, when a new SIP channel was allocated,
	  or what an INVITE request was received. This resulted in any
	  dialog associated with a peer that supported T.38 having udptl
	  support assigned to it, including the UDP ports needed for
	  communication. This occurred even in non-INVITE dialogs that
	  would never send image media. This patch creates and initializes
	  the udptl structure only when the SDP for a dialog specifies that
	  image media is supported, or when Asterisk indicates through the
	  appropriate control frame that a dialog is to support T.38.

	* main/rtp_engine.c: Handle AST_CONTROL_UPDATE_RTP_PEER frames in
	  local bridge loop Failing to handle AST_CONTROL_UPDATE_RTP_PEER
	  frames in the local bridge loop causes the loop to exit
	  prematurely. This causes a variety of negative side effects,
	  depending on when the loop exits. This patch handles the frame by
	  essentially swallowing the frame in the local loop, as the
	  current channel drivers expect the RTP bridge to handle the
	  frame, and, in the case of the local bridge loop, no additional
	  action is necessary. (issue ASTERISK-19040) (issue

	  with MOH Prior to this patch, res_musiconhold existed at the same
	  module priority level as the timing sources that it depends on.
	  This would cause a problem when music on hold was reloaded, as
	  the timing source could be changed after res_musiconhold was
	  processed. This patch adds a new module priority level,
	  AST_MODPRI_TIMING, that the various timing modules are now loaded
	  at. This now occurs before loading other resource modules, such
	  that the timing source is guaranteed to be set prior to resolving
	  the timing source dependencies. (closes issue ASTERISK-17474)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: In ChanSpy, don't create audiohooks that will
	  never be used. When ChanSpy is initialized it creates and
	  attaches 3 audiohooks: 1) Read audio off of the channel that we
	  are spying on 2) Write audio to the channel that we are spying on
	  3) Write audio to the channel that is bridged to the channel that
	  we are spying on. The first is always necessary, but the others
	  are used only when specific options are passed to the ChanSpy
	  application (B, d, w, and W to be specific). When those flags are
	  not passed, neither of those audiohooks are ever sent frames, but
	  we still try to process the hooks for each voice frame that we
	  recieve on the channel. So in short - only create and attach
	  audiohooks that we actually need.

	* include/asterisk/pbx.h, main/pbx.c, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix
	  extension state callback references in chan_sip. Chan_sip gives a
	  dialog reference to the extension state callback and assumes that
	  when ast_extension_state_del() returns, the callback cannot
	  happen anymore. Chan_sip then reduces the dialog reference count
	  associated with the callback. Recent changes (ASTERISK-17760)
	  have resulted in the potential for the callback to happen after
	  ast_extension_state_del() has returned. For chan_sip, this could
	  be very bad because the dialog pointer could have already been
	  destroyed. * Added ast_extension_state_add_destroy() so chan_sip
	  can account for the sip_pvt reference given to the extension
	  state callback when the extension state callback is deleted. *
	  Fix pbx.c awkward statecbs handling in
	  ast_extension_state_add_destroy() and handle_statechange() now
	  that the struct ast_state_cb has a destructor to call. * Ensure
	  that ast_extension_state_add_destroy() will never return -1 or 0
	  for a successful registration. * Fixed pbx.c statecbs_cmp() to
	  compare the correct information. The passed in value to compare
	  is a change_cb function pointer not an object pointer. * Make
	  pbx.c ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() not perform callbacks with
	  AST_EXTENSION_REMOVED with locks held. Chan_sip is notorious for
	  deadlocking when those locks are held during the callback. *
	  Removed unused lock declaration for the pbx.c store_hints list.

	* main/pbx.c: Resolve duplicate label used in multiple priorities
	  for the same extension. Prior to this patch, if labels with the
	  same name were used for different priorities in the same
	  extension, the new label would be accepted, but it would be
	  unusable since attempts to reach that label would just go to the
	  first one. Now pbx.c detects this, generates a warning in logs,
	  and culls the label before adding it to the dialplan. (closes

	  domain ACL bypass. The code that allowed admins to create users
	  with domain-only uri's had stopped to work in 1.8 because of the

	  [mydomain.com] sip user, you can register with useraddr
	  sip:mydomain.com. Note that in that case -- if you're using
	  domain ACLs (a configured domain list) -- mydomain.com must be in

	* CHANGES: Change nat=yes to nat=force_rport in CHANGES Fix a small
	  documentation merge issue ASTERISK-18862

	* configs/sip.conf.sample, CHANGES, /, channels/chan_sip.c: Default
	  to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ It is
	  possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
	  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a
	  request is sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via
	  header. In 1.4 and 1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was
	  nat=yes or nat=route and the other was either nat=no or
	  nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one was
	  nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no. In order to address
	  this problem, it was decided to switch the default behavior to
	  nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option and to
	  strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
	  possible. For more discussion of the issue, please see:

	  channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c: Don't treat a host:port string as
	  a domain The domain matching code prior to 1.8 used to manually
	  remove the port from the host:port string when determining if an
	  incoming request matched the list of domains. When switching to
	  the new parsing functions, the documentation implied that the
	  "domain" was being returned by these functions, when instead it
	  was returning the "hostport" as defined by RFC 3261. This led to
	  confusion and resulted in 1.8+ rejecting an incoming request from

	  renames the "domain" variables in the parsing functions to
	  "hostport" to more accurately describe what it is that they are
	  returning and also properly truncates the resulting hostport
	  strings when dealing with domain matching. Review:

	  were several problems with the dynamic realtime peer/user lookup

	  of incremental changes to the realtime_peer function. And, during
	  the addition of the sipregs functionality, several possibilities
	  for memory leaks had been introduced. The insecure=port matching
	  has always been broken for anyone using the sipregs family. And,
	  related, the broken implementation forced those using sipregs to
	  *still* have an ipaddr column on their sippeers table. Thanks
	  Terry Wilson for comprehensive testing and finding and fixing
	  unexpected behaviour from the multientry realtime call which
	  caused the realtime_peer to have a completely unused code path.
	  This changeset fixes the leaks, the lookup inconsistenties and
	  that you won't need an ipaddr column on your sippeers table
	  anymore (when you're using sipregs). Beware that when you're
	  using sipregs, peers with insecure=port will now start matching!

	* apps/app_queue.c: Simplify queue membercount code Despite an
	  ominous sounding comment stating that membercount was for "logged

	  I could not find a single place in the code where that seemed to
	  be accurate. The only time we decremented membercount was when we
	  were marking something dead or actually removing it. The only
	  places we incremented it were either after ao2_link(), or trying
	  to correct for having set it to 0 during a reload. In every case
	  where we were correcting the value, it seemed that we were trying
	  to make the count actually match what ao2_container_count() would
	  return. The only place I could find where we made a determination
	  about something being "logged in" or not, we didn't trust the
	  membercount, but instead looked at devicestate, paused, etc. This
	  patch removes membercount, replaces its use with

	* Fixed crash from orphaned MWI subscriptions in chan_sip

	  This patch resolves the issue where MWI subscriptions are orphaned
	  by subsequent SIP SUBSCRIBE messages.  When a peer is removed, either
	  by pruning realtime SIP peers or by unloading / loading chan_sip, the
	  MWI subscriptions that were orphaned would still be on the event engine
	  list of valid subscriptions but have a pointer to a peer that no longer
	  was valid.  When an MWI event would occur, this would cause a seg fault.

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-18663)
	  Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1610/

	* Don't crash on INFO automon request with no channel

	  AST-2011-014. When automon was enabled in features.conf, it was possible
	  to crash Asterisk by sending an INFO request if no channel had been
	  created yet.

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-18805)

	* Default to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ

	  AST-2011-013.  It is possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
	  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a request is
	  sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via header. In 1.4 and
	  1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was nat=yes or nat=route and the other
	  was either nat=no or nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one
	  was nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no.

	  In order to address this problem, it was decided to switch the default
	  behavior to nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option
	  and to strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
	  possible.

2011-10-05  Asterisk Development Team <asteriskteam@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 1.8.8.0-rc1 Released.

2011-10-05 21:30 +0000 [r339566]  Leif Madsen <lmadsen@digium.com>

	* build_tools/prep_tarball: Update prep_tarball script to download
	  pre-exported documentation. I've updated the prep_tarball script
	  to now download the pre-exported documentation from the Asterisk
	  wiki. This will give us more control over what is being included
	  in the tarball releases, and will make both the PDF and HTML
	  exported documentation look much better (especially when viewing
	  from a console). (Closes issue ASTERISK-18677)

	  connection problems it introduces. I'm going to attempt some
	  generic res_jabber cleanup and come up with a new fix for this
	  problem, but first it seems prudent to remove this rather broad
	  attempt to fix it and instead approach this problem either from
	  the same angle but looking only at canceling (or possibly
	  rescheduling) the send when we absolutely know it will cause a
	  segfault or, if that can't be easily accomplished, strictly from
	  the devstate side of things. Also, I'm pretty sure a lot of the
	  code in res_jabber isn't thread safe. (issue ASTERISK-18626)

	  external notifications This patch fixes an issue where the
	  voicemail duration was being reported with a duration
	  significantly less than the actual sound file duration.
	  Voicemails that contained mostly silence were reporting the
	  duration of only the sound in the file, as opposed to the
	  duration of the file with the silence. This patch fixes this by
	  having two durations reported in the __ast_play_and_record family
	  of functions - the sound_duration and the actual duration of the
	  file. The sound_duration, which is optional, now reports the
	  duration of the sound in the file, while the actual full duration
	  of the file is reported in the duration parameter. This allows
	  the voicemail applications to use the sound_duration for minimum
	  duration checking, while reporting the full duration to external
	  parties if the voicemail is kept. (issue ASTERISK-2234) (closes

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix crashes in ast_rtcp_write(). This
	  patch addresses crashes related to RTCP handling. The backtraces
	  just show a crash in ast_rtcp_write() where it appears that the
	  RTP instance is no longer valid. There is a race condition with
	  scheduled RTCP transmissions and the destruction of the RTP
	  instance. This patch utilizes the fact that ast_rtp_instance is a
	  reference counted object and ensures that it will not get
	  destroyed while a reference is still around due to scheduled RTCP
	  transmissions. RTCP transmissions are scheduled and executed from
	  the chan_sip scheduler context. This scheduler context is
	  processed in the SIP monitor thread. The destruction of an RTP
	  instance occurs when the associated sip_pvt gets destroyed (which
	  happens when the sip_pvt reference count reaches 0). However, the
	  SIP monitor thread is not the only thread that can cause a
	  sip_pvt to get destroyed. The sip_hangup function, executed from
	  a channel thread, also decrements the reference count on a
	  sip_pvt and could cause it to get destroyed. While this is being
	  changed anyway, the patch also removes calling ast_sched_del()
	  from within the RTCP scheduler callback. It's not helpful. Simply
	  returning 0 prevents the callback from being rescheduled. (closes

	* UPGRADE.txt, apps/app_dial.c: Made Dial d and H options no longer

	  break DTMF attended transfer atxferdropcall option. 1) Party A

	  C. If the dialplan uses the Dial d or H options to call Party C
	  then the Dial application answers the call immediately before
	  initiating the call leg to Party C. The premature answer causes
	  the transfer code to not invoke the atxferdropcall=no behavior
	  for a blonde transfer since Party C has "answered". The transfer

	  during the module loading process, in order to obtain priority

	  ast_do_pickup() 3) target is unlocked by ast_do_pickup() 4) app
	  dial or queue gets a chance to hang up losing calls and calls
	  ast_hangup() on target 5) SINCE A MASQUERADE HAS NOT BEEN SETUP
	  YET BY ast_do_pickup() with ast_channel_masquerade(),
	  ast_hangup() completes successfully and the channel is no longer
	  in the channels container. 6) ast_do_pickup() then calls
	  ast_channel_masquerade() to schedule the masquerade on the dead
	  channel. 7) ast_do_pickup() then calls ast_do_masquerade() on the
	  dead channel 8) bad things happen while doing the masquerade and
	  in the process ast_do_masquerade() puts the dead channel back
	  into the channels container 9) The "orphaned" channel is visible
	  in the channels list if a crash does not happen. This patch does
	  the following: * Made ast_hangup() set AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE on a
	  successfully hung-up channel and not release the channel lock
	  until that has happened. * Made __ast_channel_masquerade() not
	  setup a masquerade if either channel has AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE set. *
	  Fix chan_agent misuse of AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE since it would no longer
	  work. (closes issue ASTERISK-18222) Reported by: Alec Davis

	  calls fail when using Asterisk 1.8 with HA8, HB8, and B410P
	  cards. France Telecom brings layer 2 and layer 1 down on BRI
	  lines when the line is idle. When layer 1 goes down Asterisk
	  cannot make outgoing calls and the HA8 and HB8 cards also get IRQ
	  misses. The inability to make outgoing calls is because the line
	  is in red alarm and Asterisk will not make calls over a line it
	  considers unavailable. The IRQ misses for the HA8 and HB8 card
	  are because the hardware is switching clock sources from the line
	  which just brought layer 1 down to internal timing. There is a
	  DAHDI option for the B410P card to not tell Asterisk that layer 1
	  went down so Asterisk will allow outgoing calls: "modprobe
	  wcb4xxp teignored=1". There is a similar DAHDI option for the HA8
	  and HB8 cards: "modprobe wctdm24xxp bri_teignored=1".
	  Unfortunately that will not clear up the IRQ misses when the
	  telco brings layer 1 down. * Add layer 2 persistence option to

	  has three settings: 1) Use libpri default layer 2 setting. 2)
	  Keep layer 2 up. Bring layer 2 back up when the peer brings it

	  have no effect on a DAHDI channel. These two AMI actions are
	  highly specialized to analog channels and appear to make the

	* main/app.c, apps/app_voicemail.c, include/asterisk/app.h,
	  configs/voicemail.conf.sample: Fixes some voicemail forwarding
	  behavior based around prepend mode. Formerly, prepend forwarding
	  would have the user record a message with no useful prompt and an
	  expectation for the user to push a button on the phone when
	  finished recording. If a length of silence was detected instead,
	  the recording would be canceled and the user would re-enter the
	  voicemail forwarding menu. Subsequent time-outs in prepend
	  recording would also bug out in the sense that they would write
	  over the original message and get sent to the recipient
	  regardless of whether they timed out or were accepted. This patch
	  fixes this issue and adds a prompt which will be played after a
	  timeout informing the user that they needed to press a button.
	  Currently, the sound files that we have are somewhat inadquate
	  for this, so after the call we simply have Allison say "Please
	  try again. Then press pound." which actually relies on two
	  separate sound files. Just one would be more appropriate.

	* main/pbx.c: Deadlocks dealing with dialplan hints during reload.
	  There are two remaining different deadlocks reported dealing with

	  must be locked before the hint object. The deadlock in
	  ASTERISK-17760 is caused by a catch-22 situation in
	  handle_statechange(). The deadlock is caused by not having the
	  conlock before calling the watcher callbacks. Unfortunately,
	  having that lock causes a different deadlock as reported in
	  ASTERISK-16961. * Fixed ast_remove_hint() locking order. * Made
	  handle_statechange() no longer call the watcher callbacks holding
	  any locks that matter. * Made hint ao2 destructor do the watcher
	  callbacks for extension deactivation to guarantee that they get
	  called. * Fixed hint reference leak in ast_add_hint() if the
	  callback container constructor failed. * Fixed hint reference
	  leak in complete_core_show_hint() for every hint it found for CLI
	  tab completion. * Adjusted locking in

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Inband DTMF regression The functionality of
	  inband DTMF in chan_sip relied upon
	  ast_rtp_instance_dtmf_mode_get/set not working properly to avoid
	  calling ast_rtp_instance_dtmf_begin/end on RTP streams with
	  inband DTMF. According to documentation,
	  ast_rtp_instance_dtmf_begin/end is meant only for RFC2833 DTMF,
	  never inband. This fixes the regression introduced in revision
	  328823.

	* sounds/Makefile, Makefile, Makefile.moddir_rules: Revert partial
	  attempt at handling pathnames with spaces. Revision 299794
	  attempted to improve the build system to be able to handle
	  pathnames (primarily DESTDIR) with spaces in them, since this is
	  common on some platforms (including Mac OSX). Unfortunately, the
	  changes were incomplete and did not actually provide the desired
	  behavior, and as a side effect the functionality that ensured
	  that stale headers in the Asterisk 'include' directory were
	  removed got broken. In addition, the check for stale (and
	  possibly incompatible) modules in the Asterisk 'modules'
	  directory also got broken, and would never report any stale
	  modules. Users upgrading to this version or later versions would
	  then see unexpected module load errors. Since there are few users
	  who actually want to install Asterisk into paths that contain
	  spaces, and a proper fix for the build system would take many
	  hours, the best solution for now is to just revert the partial
	  solution.

	* include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h, res/res_rtp_asterisk.c,
	  main/rtp_engine.c, channels/chan_sip.c: RTP bridge away with
	  inband DTMF and feature detection When deciding whether Asterisk
	  was allowed to bridge the call away from the core, chan_sip did
	  not take into account the usage of features on dialed channels
	  that require monitoring of DTMF on channels utilizing inband
	  DTMF. This would cause Asterisk to allow the call to be locally
	  or remotely bridged, preventing access to the data required to
	  detect activations of such features. (closes 17237) Review:

	  the conference. This behavior was introduced in rev 311616 when

	* main/manager.c: Correct double-free situation in manager output
	  processing. The process_output() function calls ast_str_append()
	  and xml_translate() on its 'out' parameter, which is a pointer to
	  an ast_str buffer. If either of these functions need to
	  reallocate the ast_str so it will have more space, they will free
	  the existing buffer and allocate a new one, returning the address
	  of the new one. However, because process_output only receives a
	  pointer to the ast_str, not a pointer to its caller's variable
	  holding the pointer, if the original ast_str is freed, the caller
	  will not know, and will continue to use it (and later attempt to
	  free it). (reported by jkroon on #asterisk-dev)

	* tests/test_substitution.c: Use 'printf' (POSIX issue 4) instead
	  of 'echo -n', for portability. The problem with using 'echo -n'
	  is that it is not portable. While BSD systems required that the
	  '-n' option be removed and interpreted, System V required that
	  all strings should be echoed with no interpretation of options.
	  This fundamental difference of behavior means that it is never
	  possible to use the '-n' flag to echo in tests which are meant to
	  be portable. In this case, on Mac OS X 10.6, the /bin/sh shell
	  builtin 'echo' uses the System V semantics of the command, and
	  thus the SHELL test failed on that platform.

	* main/event.c: [regression] Voicemail MWI is no longer sent. When
	  leaving a voicemail, the MWI message is never sent. The same

	  If you restart Asterisk, everything comes up at that state
	  correctly, but changes to the messages in voicemail causes the
	  light to not be set appropriately. Very easy to reproduce. * Made
	  ast_event_check_subscriber() return TRUE if there are ANY
	  subscribers to an event type when there are no restricting ie
	  values passed. This allows an event being queued to be queued.

	  memory that falls on a page boundary. The fix for ASTERISK-15359
	  was incorrect in that it added 1 to the length of the mmap'd
	  region. The problem with this is that reading/writing to that
	  extra byte outside of the bounds of the underlying fd causes a
	  bus error. The real issue is that we are working with both a FILE
	  * and the raw fd underneath it and not synchronizing between
	  them. The code that was removed in ASTERISK-15359 was correct,
	  but we weren't flushing the FILE * before mapping the fd. Looking
	  at the manager code in 1.4 reveals that the FILE * in 'struct
	  mansession' is never used except to create a temporary file that
	  we immediately fdopen. This means we just need to write a 0 byte
	  to the fd and everything will just work. The other branches
	  require a call to fflush() which, while not a guaranteed fix,
	  should reduce the likelihood of a crash. This all makes sense in
	  my head. (closes issue ASTERISK-16460) Reported by:

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, main/channel.c, main/features.c: Give
	  zombies a safe channel driver to use. Recent crashes from zombie
	  channels suggests that they need a safe home to goto. When a
	  masquerade happens, the physical part of the zombie channel is
	  hungup. The hangup normally sets the channel private pointer to
	  NULL. If someone then blindly does a callback to the channel
	  driver, a crash is likely because the private pointer is NULL.
	  The masquerade now sets the channel technology of zombie channels
	  to the kill channel driver. Related to the following issues:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: This commit modifies the way polling is done
	  on TLS sockets. Because of the buffering the TLS layer does,
	  polling is unreliable. If poll is called while there is data
	  waiting to be read in the TLS layer but not at the network layer,
	  the messaging processing engine will not proceed until something
	  else writes data to the socket, which may not occur. This change
	  modifies the logic around TLS sockets to only poll after a failed
	  read on a non-blocking socket. This way we know that there is no
	  data waiting to be read from the buffering layer. (closes issue

	  and must not continue executing the dialplan. * Changes the
	  return value of the directed pickup applications to return zero
	  if the pickup failed and nonzero(-1) if the pickup succeeded. *
	  Made some code optimizations that no longer require re-checking

	  being leaked. This would cause RTP ports to never be destroyed
	  (leading to exhaustion of all available RTP ports) and memory
	  leaks. The original patch for this issue from rgagnon was the

	  | 18 lines Allow transfer loops without allowing forwarding loops
	  We try to avoid the situation where two phones may be forwarded
	  to each other causing an infinite loop by storing each dialed
	  interface in a channel datastore and checking the list before
	  dialing out. This works, but currently breaks situations like A
	  calls B, A transfers B to C, B transfers C to A, and A transfers
	  C to B. Since human interaction is happening here and not an
	  automated forwarding loop, it should be allowed. This patch
	  removes the dialed_interfaces datastore when a call is bridged (a
	  suggestion from the brilliant mmichelson). If a call is being
	  bridged, it should be safe to assume that we aren't stuck in a
	  loop. Since we are now handling this is the bridge code, the
	  previous attempts at handling it in app_dial and app_queue are
	  removed. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1195/

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove the need for deadlock avoidance in
	  chan_sip do_monitor. Deadlock avoidance between the sip pvt and
	  the pvt->owner is very difficult. Now that channel's are ao2
	  objects, this complication is no longer necessary. It turns out
	  the pvt's msg queue only exists because of deadlock avoidance
	  (when deadlock avoidance fails msgs were added to a queue to be
	  processed later), so this goes away as well. The technique used
	  in the new sip_lock_pvt_full() function should be used as a
	  template for replacing all locations where deadlock avoidance
	  occurs between a channel tech_pvt and the pvt's owner. My hope is
	  that this will begin a reversal of the invalid channel driver
	  locking architecture we have been using for so long. This patch
	  also resolves an issue where the pvt->owner gets unlocked during
	  processing the msg queue. (closes issue #18690) Reported by:

	* include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h, main/rtp_engine.c,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: sip codec negotiation of dynamic rtp
	  payloads error fix This patch fixes how chan_sip handles dynamic
	  rtp payload types it does not understand. At the moment if a
	  dynamic payload's mime type does not match one we understand, the
	  payload does not get removed from our payload table. As a result
	  of this, the payload is set to whatever dynamic codec we use
	  internally for that payload number on outgoing INVITES. This is
	  incorrect. This patch fixes this by properly checking the rtpmap
	  set function's return code to make sure it was found. The
	  function can return both -1 and -2 depending on the source of the
	  mismatch. We were just checking -1 explicitly. Review:

	  | 25 lines Stuck channel using FEATD_MF if caller hangs up at the
	  right time. The cause was actually a caller hanging up just at
	  the end of the Feature Group D DTMF tones that setup the call.
	  The reason for this is a "guard timer" that's implemented using
	  ast_safe_sleep(100). If the caller happens to hang up AFTER the
	  final tone of the DTMF string but BEFORE the end of that
	  ast_safe_sleep(), then ast_safe_sleep() will return non-zero.
	  This causes the code to bounce to the end of ss_thread(), but it
	  does NOT tear down the call properly. This should be a rare
	  occurrence because the caller has to hang up at EXACTLY the right
	  time. Nonetheless, it was happening quite regularly on the
	  reporter's system. It's not easily reproducible, unless you
	  purposely increase the guard-time to 2000 or more. Once you do
	  that, you can reproduce it every time by watching the DTMF debug
	  and hanging up just as it ends. Simply add an ast_hangup() before
	  goto quit. (closes issue #15671) Reported by: jcromes Patches:

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: When a call going out an NT-PTMP port gets
	  rejected, Asterisk crashes. If a call is sent to an ISDN phone
	  that rejects the call with RELEASE_COMPLETE(cause: call
	  reject(21), or busy(17)) Asterisk crashes. I could not get my
	  setup to crash. However, I could see the possibility from a race
	  condition between queuing an AST_CONTROL_BUSY to the core and
	  then queueing an AST_CONTROL_HANGUP. If the AST_CONTROL_BUSY is
	  processed before the AST_CONTROL_HANGUP is queued, the
	  ast_channel could be destroyed out from under chan_misdn. Avoid
	  this particular crash scenario by not queueing the
	  AST_CONTROL_HANGUP if the AST_CONTROL_BUSY was queued. (closes

	  feature added. The patch restores the o option behavior and adds
	  the ability to specify the CallerID. The Dial o and f options are
	  complementary to each other. The o option stores the CallerID on
	  the outgoing channel as the channel's CallerID. The f option
	  forces the CallerID sent by the outgoing channel. o(x) - The
	  argument 'x' is optional. If not present, then specify that the
	  CallerID that was present on the *calling* channel be stored as
	  the CallerID on the *called* channel. This was the behavior of
	  Asterisk 1.0 and earlier. If present, then specify the CallerID
	  stored on the *called* channel. Note that o(${CALLERID(all)}) is
	  similar to option o without parameters. f(x) - The argument 'x'
	  is optional and its presence changes the behavior of this option.
	  If not present, then force the outgoing CallerID on a
	  call-forward or deflection to the dialplan extension for this
	  Dial() using a dialplan 'hint'. For example, some PSTNs do not
	  allow CallerID to be set to anything other than the numbers

	  | 29 lines Don't delay DTMF in core bridge while listening for
	  DTMF features This patch is mostly the work of Olle Johansson. I
	  did some cleanup and added the silence generating code if
	  transmit_silence is set. When a channel listens for DTMF in the
	  core bridge, the outbound DTMF is not sent until we have received
	  DTMF_END. For a long DTMF, this is a disaster. We send 4 seconds
	  of DTMF to Asterisk, which sends no audio for those 4 seconds.
	  Some products see this delay and the time skew on RTP packets
	  that results and start ignoring the audio that is sent afterward.
	  With this change, the DTMF_BEGIN frame is inspected and checked.
	  If it matches a feature code, we wait for DTMF_END and activate
	  the feature as before. If transmit_silence=yes in asterisk.conf,
	  silence is sent if we paritally match a multi-digit feature. If
	  it doesn't match a feature, the frame is forwarded along with the
	  DTMF_END without delay. By doing it this way, DTMF is not
	  delayed. (closes issue #15642) Reported by: jasonshugart Patches:

	  | 25 lines "Caller*ID failed checksum" on Wildcard TDM2400P and
	  TDM410 The last character in the caller id message is getting a
	  framing error. The checksum is the last character in the message.
	  A framing error in the checksum could be because: 1) The sender
	  did not send a full stop bit. 2) The sender cut off the FSK
	  carrier too soon. 3) The sender opted to send zero of the
	  specified zero to 10 trailing mark bits and round-off errors in
	  the code resulted in the code not being where it thought it was
	  in the demodulated bit stream. Bit 8 of 'b' is set when parity
	  error. Bit 9 of 'b' is set when framing error. Made ignore the
	  framing and parity error bits if the errored character is the
	  checksum. We can tolerate a framing/parity error there. The
	  checksum character validates the message. (closes issue #18474)

	  | 31 lines Add AELSub, which provides a stable entry point into
	  AEL subroutines. This commit needs some explanation, given that
	  we're adding a new application into an existing release branch.
	  This is generally a violation of our release policy, except in
	  very limited circumstances, and I believe this is one of those
	  circumstances. The problem that this solves is one of the sanity
	  of using multiple dialplan languages to define a dialplan. In the
	  case of the reporter, he or she is using AEL is define
	  subroutines, while using Realtime extensions to invoke those
	  subroutines. While you can do this, it's based upon the reality
	  of AEL using actual dialplan extensions; however, there is no
	  guarantee that the details of _how_ AEL is compiled into
	  extensions will remain stable. In fact, at the time of this
	  commit, it has already changed twice, once in a fundamental way.
	  Now normally, a new application would only be added to trunk.
	  However, this application is explicitly to create a stable
	  user-level API between versions, and adding it to trunk only will
	  not solve the user's problem of switching between 1.6.2 and 1.8,
	  nor will it help anybody switching from 1.8 to 1.10. Therefore,
	  it needs to go into existing release branches. For the sake of
	  consistency, and also because one of the changes was between 1.4
	  and 1.6.x, I am also electing to commit this to 1.4. (closes

	* UPGRADE.txt, channels/sig_pri.c, channels/sig_pri.h,
	  channels/chan_dahdi.c, funcs/func_channel.c: Get real channel of
	  a DAHDI call. Starting with Asterisk v1.8, the DAHDI channel name
	  format was changed for ISDN calls to:
	  DAHDI/i<span>/<number>[:<subaddress>]-<sequence-number> There
	  were several reasons that the channel name had to change. 1) Call
	  completion requires a device state for ISDN phones. The generic
	  device state uses the channel name. 2) Calls do not necessarily
	  have B channels. Calls placed on hold by an ISDN phone do not
	  have B channels. 3) The B channel a call initially requests may
	  not be the B channel the call ultimately uses. Changes to the
	  internal implementation of the Asterisk master channel list
	  caused deadlock problems for chan_dahdi if it needed to change
	  the channel name. Chan_dahdi no longer changes the channel name.
	  4) DTMF attended transfers now work with ISDN phones because the
	  channel name is "dialable" like the chan_sip channel names. For
	  various reasons, some people need to know which B channel a DAHDI
	  call is using. * Added CHANNEL(dahdi_span),
	  CHANNEL(dahdi_channel), and CHANNEL(dahdi_type) so the dialplan
	  can determine the B channel currently in use by the channel. Use
	  CHANNEL(no_media_path) to determine if the channel even has a B
	  channel. * Added AMI event DAHDIChannel to associate a DAHDI
	  channel with an Asterisk channel so AMI applications can
	  passively determine the B channel currently in use. Calls with
	  "no-media" as the DAHDIChannel do not have an associated B
	  channel. No-media calls are either on hold or call-waiting.

	* channels/sig_pri.c, include/asterisk/ccss.h, channels/sig_pri.h,
	  channels/chan_dahdi.c, channels/chan_sip.c, main/ccss.c: No
	  response sent for SIP CC subscribe/resubscribe request. Asterisk
	  does not send a response if we try to subscribe for call
	  completion after we have received a 180 Ringing. You can only
	  subscribe for call completion when the call has been cleared.
	  When we receive the 180 Ringing, for this call, its
	  call-completion state is 'CC_AVAILABLE'. If we then send a
	  subscribe message to Asterisk, it trys to change the
	  call-completion state to 'CC_CALLER_REQUESTED'. Because this is
	  an invalid state change, it just ignores the message. The only
	  state Asterisk will accept our subscribe message is in the
	  'CC_CALLER_OFFERED' state. Asterisk will go into the
	  'CC_CALLER_OFFERED' when the SIP client clears the call by
	  sending a CANCEL. Asterisk should always send a response. Even if
	  its a negative one. The fix is to allow for the CCSS core to
	  notify a CC agent that a failure has occurred when CC is
	  requested. The "ack" callback is replaced with a "respond"
	  callback. The "respond" callback has a parameter indicating
	  either a successful response or a specific type of failure that
	  may need to be communicated to the requester. (closes issue

	* apps/app_queue.c, apps/app_dial.c: Calling a gosub routine
	  defined in AEL from Dial/Queue ceased to work. A bug in AEL did

	  "s" extension that was required to exist by the chan_dahdi (or
	  another channel) that was not supplied with a starting extension.
	  Therefore, AEL made incorrect assumptions about what commands
	  were permissable in the context. This was fixed by making AEL
	  generate a different extension name. However, Dial and Queue make
	  additional assumptions about the name of the default gosub
	  extension. Therefore, they needed to be brought into line with a
	  "macro" rendered by AEL (as a gosub), without breaking

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix SIP deadlock involving state changes.
	  Once again a call to pbx_builtin_getvar_helper (and
	  pbx_builtin_setvar_helper) has caused locking problems. Both of
	  these functions lock the channel when the channel argument is
	  passed in! In this case, the suspected problem (the backtrace
	  makes it impossible to tell) was the private being locked in

	  | 16 lines Guard against retransmitting BYEs indefinitely In the
	  case of an attended transfer (A calls B, A atxfers to C) where A
	  becomes unreachable before replying to Asterisk's BYE, Asterisk
	  can sometimes retransmit the BYE indefinitely. This is because
	  __sip_autodestruct tests p->refer && !ast_test_flag(&p->flags[0],
	  SIP_ALREADYGONE and will then transmit a BYE. When this BYE times
	  out, it will not ever be marked as ALREADYGONE, so when
	  __sip_autodestruct is called again, we end up starting the cycle
	  over. This patch adds a call to sip_alreadygone(pkt->owner) in
	  retrans_pkt in the case of a BYE that has timed out. This should
	  prevent Asterisk from trying to transmit new BYE messages in the
	  future. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1077/ ........

	  overlap dialing. Issue #16789 was a good idea. Unfortunately, it
	  breaks overlap dialing through Asterisk. There is not enough

	  and ast_canmatch_extension() calls are not adequate to detect a

	  overlap dialing to hear dialtone and other early media. A

	  sent after the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message for non-digital calls.
	  An AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS is now generated for incoming
	  SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE messages for non-digital calls. * Handling of
	  the AST_CONTROL_CONGESTION in chan_dahdi/sig_pri was inconsistent

	  | 31 lines Fix channel redirect out of MeetMe() and other issues
	  with channel softhangup. Mantis issue #18585 reports that a
	  channel redirect out of MeetMe() stopped working properly. This
	  issue includes a patch that resolves the issue by removing a call
	  to ast_check_hangup() from app_meetme.c. I left that in my patch,
	  as it doesn't need to be there. However, the rest of the patch
	  fixes this problem with or without the change to app_meetme. The
	  key difference between what happens before and after this patch
	  is the effect of the END_OF_Q control frame. After END_OF_Q is
	  hit in ast_read(), ast_read() will return NULL. With the
	  ast_check_hangup() removed, app_meetme sees this which causes it
	  to exit as intended. Checking ast_check_hangup() caused
	  app_meetme to exit earlier in the process, and the target of the
	  redirect saw the condition where ast_read() returned NULL.
	  Removing ast_check_hangup() works around the issue in app_meetme,
	  but doesn't solve the issue if another application did the same
	  thing. There are also other edge cases where if an application
	  finishes at the same time that a redirect happens, the target of
	  the redirect will think that the channel hung up. So, I made some
	  changes in pbx.c to resolve it at a deeper level. There are
	  already places that unset the SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO flag in an
	  attempt to abort the hangup process. My patch extends this to
	  remove the END_OF_Q frame from the channel's read queue, making
	  the "abort hangup" more complete. This same technique was used in
	  every place where a softhangup flag was cleared. (closes issue

	* main/manager.c: Resolve a memory leak with the manager interface
	  is disabled. The intent of this check as it stands in previous
	  versions of Asterisk was to check if there are any active
	  sessions. If there were no sessions, then the function would
	  return immediately and not bother with queueing up the manager
	  event to be processed. Since the conversion of storing sessions
	  in an astobj2 container, this check will always pass. I changed

	  1 1. A call B, B answered 2. B *2(atxfer) call C 3. B hangup, C

	  completes. Issue #17273 Same scenario as issue 18395 but party B
	  is an FXS port. Party B cannot do anything until the transfer it
	  started completes. If B goes back off hook before C answers, B
	  hears ringback instead of the expected dialtone. ********** Note
	  for the issue #17273 and #18395 fix: DTMF attended transfer works
	  within the channel bridge. Unfortunately, when either party A or
	  B in the channel bridge hangs up, that channel is not completely
	  hung up until the transfer completes. This is a real problem
	  depending upon the channel technology involved. For chan_dahdi,
	  the channel is crippled until the hangup is complete. Either the
	  channel is not useable (analog) or the protocol disconnect
	  messages are held up (PRI/BRI/SS7) and the media is not released.
	  For chan_sip, a call limit of one is going to block that endpoint
	  from any further calls until the hangup is complete. For party A
	  this is a minor problem. The party A channel will only be in this
	  condition while party B is dialing and when party B and C are
	  conferring. The conversation between party B and C is expected to
	  be a short one. Party B is either asking a question of party C or
	  announcing party A. Also party A does not have much incentive to
	  hangup at this point. For party B this can be a major problem
	  during a blonde transfer. (A blonde transfer is our term for an
	  attended transfer that is converted into a blind transfer. :))
	  Party B could be the operator. When party B hangs up, he assumes
	  that he is out of the original call entirely. The party B channel
	  will be in this condition while party C is ringing, while
	  attempting to recall party B, and while waiting between call
	  attempts. WARNING: The ATXFER_NULL_TECH conditional is a hack to
	  fix the problem. It will replace the party B channel technology
	  with a NULL channel driver to complete hanging up the party B
	  channel technology. The consequences of this code is that the 'h'
	  extension will not be able to access any channel technology
	  specific information like SIP statistics for the call.

	main/features: Use POLLPRI when waiting for events on parked channels.

	This change resolves a regression in the 1.6.2 when converting from
	select to poll. The DAHDI timers use POLLPRI to indicate that the
	timer
	fired, but features was not waiting for that flag. The result was no
	audio for MOH when a call was parked and res_timing_dahdi was in use.

	This patch is slightly modified from the one on the mantis issue. It
	does
	not set an exception on the channel if the POLLPRI flag is set.

	Resolve a memory leak with the manager interface is disabled.

	The intent of this check as it stands in previous versions of Asterisk
	was to
	check if there are any active sessions.  If there were no sessions,
	then the
	function would return immediately and not bother with queueing up the
	manager
	event to be processed.  Since the conversion of storing sessions in an
	astobj2
	container, this check will always pass.  I changed it to go back to
	checking
	what was intended.

	The side effect of this was that if the AMI is disabled, the manager
	event
	queue is populated anyway, but the code that runs to clear out the
	queue
	never runs.  A producer with no consumer is a bad thing.

	* channels/sig_pri.c: Deadlock between dahdi_request() and

	  sig_pri_new_ast_channel() is called with the channel private lock
	  held when pri_dchannel() calls it and no channel private lock
	  held when dahdi_request() calls it. The use of pri_grab() in
	  sig_pri_new_ast_channel() could leave the channel private lock
	  held when it returns if the lock was not held before calling it.
	  Make sig_pri_new_ast_channel() just lock the PRI span lock
	  instead of using pri_grab(). It is safe to do this because
	  dahdi_request() does not have the channel private lock and the
	  deadlock potential with the PRI span lock is only between

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve deadlock involving REFER. Two fixes:
	  1) One must always have the private unlocked before calling
	  pbx_builtin_setvar_helper to not invalidate locking order since
	  it locks the channel. 2) Unlock the channel before calling
	  pbx_find_extension, which starts and stops autoservice during the
	  lookup. The problem scenario as illustrated by the reporter:
	  Thread: do_monitor ----------------------- handle_request_do
	  handle_incoming handle_request_refer ast_parking_ext_valid
	  pbx_find_extension ast_autoservice_stop while (chan_list_state ==
	  as_chan_list_state) { usleep(1000); } Thread: autoservice_run
	  ----------------------- autoservice_run chan = ast_waitfor_n
	  ast_waitfor_nandfds ast_waitfor_nandfds_classic / simple /
	  complex (depending on your system) ast_channel_lock(c[x]);
	  handle_request_do and schedule_process_request_queue locks the
	  owner if it exists. The autoservice thread is waiting for the
	  channel lock, which wasn't ever released since the do_monitor
	  thread was waiting for autoservice operations to complete. Solved
	  by unlocking the channel but keeping a reference to guarantee
	  safety. (closes issue #18403) Reported by: jthurman Patches:

	  | 23 lines Fix not stopping MOH when transfered local channel
	  queue member is answered. The problem here is only present when
	  local channels are used with the MOH passthru option as well as
	  no optimization (/nm). I will describe the slightly bizarre
	  scenario that was used to test, where phones B and C are queue
	  members: Phone A dials into a queue with two members using local
	  channels and the above options. Phone B answers. Phone A blind
	  transfers phone B into the same queue. Phone A hangs up. Phone C
	  answers, but phone B didn't stop playing MOH. In this scenario,
	  the unhold frame that should have gotten to phone B never arrived
	  due to the masquerade from the blind transfer. This is usually
	  fine since app_queue manages the starting and stopping of MOH.
	  However, with the passthrough option enabled when app_queue
	  attempts to stop MOH it tries to do so on the local channel
	  rather than the real channel. The easiest solution was to just
	  make sure to send an unhold frame during the transfer since it
	  wouldn't make sense to have MOH playing after a transfer anyway.
	  This only modifies SIP transfers, but the other transfers did not
	  seem to be a problem. If DTMF based transfers were a problem it
	  might be okay to add ast_moh_stop to finishup, but I didn't want
	  to have to add that unless required. ABE-2624 ........

	  gets a CallWaiting pip. The FXS connected phone has to have
	  CW/CID support to fail, as it will send back a DTMF 'A' or 'D'
	  when it's ready to receive CallerID. A normal phone with no CID
	  never fails. Also the SIP phone does not hear MOH when the CW
	  call is answered. The DTMF end frame is suppressed when the phone
	  acknowledges the CW signal for CID. The problem is the DTMF begin
	  frame needs to be suppressed as well. The DTMF begin frame is
	  causing SIP to start sending the DTMF RTP frames. Since the DTMF
	  end frame is suppressed, SIP will not stop sending those DTMF RTP
	  packets. * Suppress the DTMF begin and end frames when the
	  channel driver is looking for DTMF digits. * Fixed a couple
	  issues caused by not cleaning up the CID spill if you answer the
	  CW call while it is sending the CID spill. * Fixed not sending
	  CW/CID spill to the phone when the call is natively bridged.
	  (Fixed by not using native bridge if CW/CID is possible.) *
	  Suppress received audio when sending CW/CID spills. The other
	  parties involved do not need to hear the CW/CID spills and may be
	  confused if the CW call is for them. (closes issue #18129)

	  NOTE: * v1.4 does not have the main problem fixed by suppressing
	  the DTMF start frames. The other three items fixed are relevant.
	  * If you really must restore native bridging between analog
	  ports, you need to disable CW/CID either by configuring
	  chan_dahdi.conf callwaitingcallerid=no or dialing *70 before
	  dialing the number to temporarily disable CW. ........

	  | 38 lines Handle failures building translation paths more
	  effectively. The problem scenario occurred on a heavily loaded
	  system that was using the codec_dahdi module and exceeded the
	  hardware transcoding capacity. The failure mode at that point was
	  not good. The report came in to us as an Asterisk lock-up. The
	  "core show locks" shows a ton of threads locked up (but no
	  obvious deadlock). Upon deeper investigation, when the system is
	  in this state, the CPU was maxed out. The CPU was being consumed
	  by the Asterisk logger spewing messages on every audio frame for
	  calls set up after transcoder capacity was reached. The purpose
	  of this patch is to make Asterisk handle failures to create a
	  translation path in a more graceful manner. If we can't
	  translate, then the call just needs to be dropped, as it's not
	  going to work. These are the changes: 1) In set_format() of
	  channel.c (which is called by set_read_format() and
	  set_write_format()), it was ignoring if
	  ast_translator_build_path() failed and returned NULL. It now pays
	  attention to that case and returns a result reflecting failure.
	  With this change in place, the bridging code will immediately
	  detect a failure and end the bridge instead of proceeding to try
	  to bridge frames that can't be translated and making channel
	  drivers freak out by sending them frames in a format they weren't
	  expecting. 2) In ast_indicate_data() of channel.c, failure of
	  ast_playtones_start() was ignored. It is now reflected in the
	  return value of the function. This didn't turn out to have any
	  affect on the bug, but seemed like a good change to leave in. 3)
	  In app_dial(), when only sending a call to a single endpoint, it
	  will attempt to do some bridging of its own of early audio. It
	  uses make_compatible() when it's going to do this. However, it
	  ignored failure from make compatible. So, even with the fix from
	  #1, if there was early audio going through app_dial, there would
	  still be a period of invalid frames passing through. After
	  detecting failure here, Dial() exits. ABE-2658 ........

	  | 46 lines The channel redirect function (CLI or AMI) hangs up
	  the call instead of redirecting the call. To recreate the
	  problem: 1) Party A calls Party B 2) Invoke CLI "channel
	  redirect" command to redirect channel call leg associated with A.
	  3) All associated channels are hung up. Note that if the CLI
	  command were done on the channel call leg associated with B it
	  works. This regression was a result of the fix for issue #16946
	  (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/740/). The regression affects
	  all features that use an async goto to execute the dialplan
	  because of an external event: Channel redirect, AMI redirect, SIP
	  REFER, and FAX detection. The struct ast_channel._softhangup code
	  is a mess. The variable is used for several purposes that do not
	  necessarily result in the call being hung up. I have added
	  doxygen comments to describe how the various _softhangup bits are
	  used. I have corrected all the places where the variable was
	  tested in a non-bit oriented manner. The primary fix is the new
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q frame. It acts as a weak hangup request so
	  the soft hangup requests that do not normally result in a hangup
	  do not hangup. JIRA SWP-2470 JIRA SWP-2489 (closes issue #18171)

	  | 29 lines Fix cache of device state changes for multiple
	  servers. This patch addresses a regression where device states
	  across multiple servers were not being processing completely
	  correctly. The code works to determine the overall state by
	  looking at the last known state of a device on each server.
	  However, there was a regression due to some invasive rewrites of
	  how the cache works that led to the cache only storing the last
	  device state change for a device, regardless of which server it
	  was on. The code is set up to cache device state change events by
	  ensuring that each event in the cache has a unique device name +
	  entity ID (server ID). The code that was responsible for
	  comparing raw information elements (which EID is) always returned
	  a match due to a memcmp() with a length of 0. There isn't much
	  code to fix the actual bug. This patch also introduces a new CLI
	  command that was very useful for debugging this problem. The
	  command allows you to dump the contents of the event cache.

	  | 18 lines Fix problem with qualify option packets for realtime
	  peers never stopping. The option packets not only never stopped,
	  but if a realtime peer was not in the peer list multiple options
	  dialogs could accumulate over time. This scenario has the
	  potential to progress to the point of saturating a link just from
	  options packets. The fix was to ensure that the poke scheduler
	  checks to see if a peer is in the peer list before continuing to
	  poke. The reason a peer must be in the peer list to be able to
	  properly manage an options dialog is because otherwise the call
	  pointer is lost when the peer is regenerated from the database,
	  which is how existing qualify dialogs are detected. (closes issue

	  | 47 lines Fix a deadlock in device state change processing.
	  Copied from some notes from the original author (Russell):
	  Deadlock scenario: Thread 1: device state change thread Holds -
	  rdlock on contexts Holds - hints lock Waiting on channels
	  container lock Thread 2: SIP monitor thread Holds the "iflock"
	  Holds a sip_pvt lock Holds channel container lock Waiting for a
	  channel lock Thread 3: A channel thread (chan_local in this case)
	  Holds 2 channel locks acquired within app_dial Holds a 3rd
	  channel lock it got inside of chan_local Holds a local_pvt lock
	  Waiting on a rdlock of the contexts lock A bunch of other threads
	  waiting on a wrlock of the contexts lock To address this
	  deadlock, some locking order rules must be put in place and
	  enforced. Existing relevant rules: 1) channel lock before a pvt
	  lock 2) contexts lock before hints lock 3) channels container
	  before a channel What's missing is some enforcement of the order
	  when you involve more than any two. To fix this problem, I put in
	  some code that ensures that (at least in the code paths involved
	  in this bug) the locks in (3) come before the locks in (2). To
	  change the operation of thread 1 to comply, I converted the
	  storage of hints to an astobj2 container. This allows processing
	  of hints without holding the hints container lock. So, in the
	  code path that led to thread 1's state, it no longer holds either
	  the contexts or hints lock while it attempts to lock the channels
	  container. (closes issue #18165) Reported by: antonio ABE-2583

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: valgrind reported references to freed
	  memory during a mISDN hangup collision. Bad things have been
	  happening in chan_misdn because the chan_misdn channel private
	  struct chan_list is not protected from reentrancy. Hangup
	  collisions have be causing read and write accesses to freed
	  memory. Converted chan_misdn struct chan_list to an ao2 object
	  for its reference counting feature. ********** Removed an
	  impediment to converting chan_list to an ao2 object. The use of
	  the other_ch member in chan_list is shaky at best. It is set if
	  the incoming and outgoing call legs are mISDN. The use of the
	  other_ch member goes against the Asterisk architecture and can
	  even cause problems. 1) It is used to disable echo cancellation.
	  This could be bad if the call is forked and the winning call leg
	  is not mISDN or the winning call leg is not the last mISDN
	  channel called by the fork. The other_ch would become a dangling
	  pointer. 2) It is used when the far end is alerting to hear the
	  far end's inband audio instead of Asterisk's generated ringback
	  tone. This is bad if the call is forked. You would only hear the
	  last forked mISDN channel and it may not be ringing yet. The
	  other_ch would become a dangling pointer if the call is later
	  transferred. ********** JIRA SWP-2423 JIRA ABE-2614

	  receiving unexpected frame sizes. dahdi-linux 2.4.0 (specifically
	  commit 9034) added the capability for the wctc4xxp to return more
	  than a single packet of data in response to a read. However, when
	  decoding packets, codec_dahdi was still assuming that the default
	  number of samples was in each read. In other words, each packet
	  your provider sent you, regardless of size, would result in 20 ms
	  of decoded data (30 ms if decoding G723). If your provider was
	  sending 60 ms packets then codec_dahdi would end up stripping 40
	  ms of data from each transcoded frame resulting in "choppy"
	  audio. This would only affect systems where G729 packets are
	  arriving in sizes greater than 20ms or G723 packets arriving in
	  sizes greater than 30ms. DAHDI-744. ........ ................

	* include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h, main/rtp_engine.c,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: Avoid valgrind warnings for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_xxx_address The documentation for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_(local/remote)_address stated that they
	  returned 0 for success and -1 on failure. Instead, they returned
	  0 if the address structure passed in was already equivalent to
	  the address instance local/remote address or 1 otherwise. 90% of
	  the calls to these functions completely ignored the return
	  address and passed in an uninitialized struct, which would make
	  valgrind complain even though the operation was technically safe.
	  This patch fixes the documentation and converts the
	  get_xxx_address functions to void since all they really do is
	  copy the address and cannot fail. Additionally two new functions
	  (ast_rtp_instance_get_and_cmp_(local/remote)_address) are created
	  for the 3 times where the return value was actually checked. The
	  get_and_cmp_local_address function is currently unused, but
	  exists for the sake of symmetry. The only functional change as a
	  result of this change is that we will not do an
	  ast_sockaddr_cmp() on (mostly uninitialized) addresses before
	  doing the ast_sockaddr_copy() in the get_*_address functions. So,
	  even though it is an API change, it shouldn't have a noticeable
	  change in behavior. Review:

	  | 29 lines Fix inprocess_container in voicemail to correctly
	  restrict max messages. The comparison function logic was off, so
	  the number of sessions for a given mailbox were not being
	  incremented properly. This problem caused the maximum number of
	  messages per folder to not be respected when simultaneously
	  leaving multiple voicemails just below the threshold. These
	  problems should be fixed by the above, but just in case: Fixed
	  resequence_mailbox to rely on the actual number of detected
	  number of files in a directory rather than just assuming only 10
	  messages more than the maximum had been left. Also if more
	  messages than the maximum are deleted they are actually removed
	  now. The second purpose of this commit should have been separated
	  out probably, but is related to the above. Again, if the number
	  of messages in a given voicemail folder exceeds the maximum set
	  limit make sure to allocate enough space for the deleted and
	  heard index tracking array. A few random fixes: There was a
	  forgotten decrement of the inprocess count in imap_store_file.
	  When using IMAP storage, do not look in the directory where file
	  based storage messages may still reside and influence the message
	  count. Ensure to use only the first format in sendmail. ABE-2516

	  | 27 lines This patch turns chan_local pvts into astobj2 objects.
	  chan_local does some dangerous things involving deadlock
	  avoidance. tech_pvt functions like hangup and queue_frame are
	  provided with a locked channel upon entry. Those functions are
	  completely safe as long as you don't attempt to give up that
	  channel lock, but that is impossible to guarantee due to the
	  required deadlock avoidance necessary to lock both the tech_pvt
	  and both channels involved. In the past, we have tried to account
	  for this by doing things like setting a "glare" flag that
	  indicates what function should destroy the pvt. This was used in
	  local_hangup and local_queue_frame to decided who should destroy
	  the pvt if they collided in separate threads. I have removed the
	  need to do this by converting all chan_local tech_pvts to
	  astobj2. This means we can ref a pvt before deadlock avoidance
	  and not have to worry about that pvt possibly getting destroyed
	  under us. It also cleans up where we destroy the tech_pvt. The
	  only unlink from the tech_pvt container occurs in local_hangup
	  now, which is where it should occur. Since there still may be
	  thread collisions on some functions like local_hangup after
	  deadlock avoidance, I have added some checks to detect those
	  collisions and exit appropriately. I think this patch is going to
	  solve quite a bit of weirdness we have had with local channels in
	  the past. ........ ................

	* tests/test_event.c: Prevent multiple runs of event_sub_test from
	  producing false failure results. The array of test subscriptions
	  was declared "static," meaning that the data.count field would
	  retain its value between runs of the test. After the first test
	  run, this would result in false reports of test failures. I chose
	  to just remove the "static" keyword from the structure since it's
	  not a huge deal to construct this structure during each run of
	  the test. Another alternative would have been to zero out the
	  data.count fields of each test subscription instead.

	* contrib/scripts/ast_tls_cert (added): Add TLS cert helper script
	  This script is useful for quickly generating self-signed CA,
	  server, and client certificates for use with Asterisk. It is
	  still recommended to obtain certificates from a recognized
	  Certificate Authority and to develop an understanding how SSL
	  certificates work. Real security is hard work. OPTIONS: -h Show
	  this message -m Type of cert "client" or "server". Defaults to
	  server. -f Config filename (openssl config file format) -c CA
	  cert filename (creates new CA cert/key as ca.crt/ca.key if not
	  passed) -k CA key filename -C Common name (cert field) For a
	  server cert, this should be the same address that clients attempt
	  to connect to. Usually this will be the Fully Qualified Domain
	  Name, but might be the IP of the server. For a CA or client cert,
	  it is merely informational. Make sure your certs have unique
	  common names. -O Org name (cert field) An informational string
	  (company name) -o Output filename base (defaults to asterisk) -d
	  Output directory (defaults to the current directory) Example: To
	  create a CA and a server (pbx.mycompany.com) cert with output in
	  /tmp: ast_tls_cert -C pbx.mycompany.com -O "My Company" -d /tmp
	  This will create a CA cert and key as well as asterisk.pem and
	  the the two files that it is made from: asterisk.crt and
	  asterisk.key. Copy asterisk.pem and ca.crt somewhere (like
	  /etc/asterisk) and set tlscertfile=/etc/asterisk.pem and
	  tlscafile=/etc/ca.crt. Since this is a self-signed key, many
	  devices will require you to import the ca.crt file as a trusted
	  cert. To create a client cert using the CA cert created by the
	  example above: ast_tls_cert -m client -c /tmp/ca.crt -k
	  /tmp/ca.key -C "Joe User" -O \ "My Company" -d /tmp -o joe_user
	  This will create client.crt/key/pem in /tmp. Use this if your
	  device supports a client certificate. Make sure that you have the
	  ca.crt file set up as a tlscafile in the necessary Asterisk
	  configs. Make backups of all .key files in case you need them
	  later.

	* main/netsock2.c: Set TCLASS field of IPv6 header when sip qos
	  options are set. (closes issue #18099) Reported by: jamesnet

	  Tested by: dvossel, jamesnet

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Safer xml parsing, treat all clients the
	  same, and better local candidate selection. The gtalk channel
	  driver was doing several unsafe operations in regards to how it
	  parsed incoming XML messages. I have cleaned that code up so it
	  should be much safer now. We now treat all clients types the
	  same. We have no reason to distinguish between GMAIL and GOOGLE
	  VOICE clients anymore because they all work the same way. I also
	  modified how the local ip is found. If no bindaddress is provided
	  in the config file, we attempt to determine the local ip we would
	  use to connect to google.com. If that fails, then we fall back to
	  the ast_find_ourip() function as a last resort. Using the new
	  method makes it much less likely that we would ever advertise a
	  local RTP candidate as a loopback address.

	  | 21 lines Don't ignore frames that have been queued when
	  softhangup'd When an outgoing call is answered and hung up by the
	  far end *very* quickly, we may not read any frames and therefor
	  end up with a call that displays the wrong
	  disposition/DIALSTATUS. The reason is because ast_queue_hangup()
	  immediately sets the _softhangup flag on the channel and then
	  queues the HANGUP control frame, but __ast_read refuses to read
	  any frames if ast_check_hangup() indicates that a hangup request
	  has been made (which it will if _softhangup is set). So, we end
	  up losing control frames. This change makes __ast_read continue
	  to read frames even if a soft hangup has been requested. It
	  queues a hangup frame to make sure that __ast_read() will still
	  eventually return NULL. Much thanks to David Vossel for all of

	* main/manager.c: Fixes manager.c crash. This issue was caused by
	  improper use of the mansession lock and manession_session lock.
	  These two structures are confusing to begin with so I'm not
	  surprised this occurred. I fixed this by consistently making sure
	  we use each of these locks only to protect the data in the
	  corresponding structure. We had mismatched usage of these locks
	  which resulted in no mutual exclusivity occurring at all. (closes

	* CHANGES: Update CHANGES to reflect new gtalk.conf options.

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c, include/asterisk/stun.h,

	  enhancements and general code cleanup. This patch includes
	  several chan_gtalk enhancements. Two new gtalk.conf options have
	  been added, externip and stunadd. Setting externip allows us to
	  manually specify what the external IP address is outside of a NAT
	  environment. Setting the stunaddr option to a valid stun server
	  allows for that external ip to be retrieved via a STUN server
	  automatically. This external IP is then advertised during call
	  setup as a possible candidate. I have also attempted to clean up
	  chan_gtalk's code so it meets our coding guidelines. During this
	  cleanup I noticed several things that need to be done in the code
	  and made a TODO section at the top of the file.

	  telephony-event and then sending DTMF as payload 101. This has
	  been resolved by always negotiating 101 as the payload type like

	  event duration is a running total that is incremented when
	  sending continuation packets. These continuation packets are only
	  triggered upon incoming media from the remote side, which means
	  that the running total probably is not going to end up matching

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, CHANGES, include/asterisk/framehook.h
	  (added), main/channel.c, main/framehook.c (added),
	  funcs/func_frame_trace.c (added): Addition of the FrameHook API
	  (AKA AwesomeHooks) So far all our tools for viewing and
	  manipulating media streams within Asterisk have been entirely
	  focused on audio. That made sense then, but is not scalable now.
	  The FrameHook API lets us tap into and manipulate _ANY_ type of
	  media or signaling passed on a channel present today or in the
	  future. This tool is a step in the direction of expanding
	  Asterisk's boundaries and will help generate some rather
	  interesting applications in the future. In addition to the
	  FrameHook API, a simple dialplan function exercising the api has
	  been included as well. This function is called FRAME_TRACE().
	  FRAME_TRACE() allows for the internal ast_frames read and written
	  to a channel to be output. Filters can be placed on this function

	  | 54 lines Fixes interoperability problems with session timer
	  behavior in Asterisk. CHANGES: 1. Never put "timer" in "Require"
	  header. This is not to our benefit and RFC 4028 section 7.1 even
	  warns against it. It is possible for one endpoint to perform
	  session-timer refreshes while the other endpoint does not support
	  them. If in this case the end point performing the refreshing
	  puts "timer" in the Require field during a refresh, the dialog
	  will likely get terminated by the other end. 2. Change the
	  behavior of 'session-timer=accept' in sip.conf (which is the
	  default behavior of Asterisk with no session timer configuration
	  specified) to only run session-timers as result of an incoming
	  INVITE request if the INVITE contains an "Session-Expires"
	  header... Asterisk is currently treating having the "timer"
	  option in the "Supported" header as a request for session timers
	  by the UAC. I do not agree with this. Session timers should only
	  be negotiated in "accept" mode when the incoming INVITE supplies
	  a "Session-Expires" header, otherwise RFC 4028 says we should
	  treat a request containing no "Session-Expires" header as a
	  session with no expiration. Below I have outlined some situations
	  and what Asterisk's behavior is. The table reflects the behavior
	  changes implemented by this patch. SITUATIONS: -Asterisk as UAS
	  1. Incoming INVITE: NO "Session-Expires" 2. Incoming INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires" -Asterisk as UAC 3. Outgoing INVITE: NO
	  "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response HAS "Session-Expires" header
	  4. Outgoing INVITE: NO "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response NO
	  "Session-Expires" header 5. Outgoing INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires". Active - Asterisk will have an active refresh
	  timer regardless if the other endpoint does. Inactive - Asterisk
	  does not have an active refresh timer regardless if the other
	  endpoint does. XXXXXXX - Not possible for mode.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: During OPTIONS authentication, the authpeer
	  does not need to be returned for any reason.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample, CHANGES, channels/sip/include/sip.h,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: authenticate OPTIONS requests just like we
	  would an INVITE OPTIONS requests should be treated the same as an
	  INVITE This includes authentication. This patch adds the ability
	  for incoming out of dialog OPTION requests to be authenticated
	  before providing a response indicating whether an extension is
	  available or not. The authentication routine works the exact same
	  way as it does for incoming INVITEs. This means that if a peer
	  has 'insecure=invite' in their peer definition, the same will be
	  true for the processing of the OPTIONS request. Review:

	  | 19 lines Fixed how Asterisk destroys a dialog on channel hangup
	  before invite receives a response. If an ast_channel with a SIP
	  tech pvt hangs up before the sip dialog gets a response to its
	  outgoing INVITE, Asterisk used to pretend_ack the INVITE. This is
	  not rfc compliant and results in confusion at the other endpoint.
	  sip_pretend_ack will ack and remove all the packets in the
	  retransmit queue. This means that the INVITE will stop
	  retransmitting, and that any response to that INVITE that comes
	  after the pretend_ack occurs will be ignored. Instead of faking
	  any sort of acknowledgement for an outgoing INVITE during an
	  internal hangup, we should let the protocol stack process the
	  INVITE transaction and terminate the dialog properly. This is
	  achieved by setting the PENDING_BYE flag. When this flag is used,
	  once the dialog proceeds to an escapable state the transaction
	  will either be canceled with a SIP_CANCEL or completed followed
	  immediately by a BYE. Attempting to do this any other way is
	  incorrect. If the endpoint is not responding to the INVITE
	  request, the INVITE must continue to be retransmitted until it
	  times out which will result in the dialog being destroyed.

	  | 11 lines This fix makes sure the ast_channel hangs up correctly
	  when the dialog's PENDING_BYE flag is set. When the pending bye
	  flag is used, it is possible that the dialog will terminate and
	  leave the sip_pvt->owner channel up. This is because we never
	  hangup the ast_channel after sending the SIP_BYE request. When we
	  receive the response for the SIP_BYE we set need_destroy which we
	  would expect to destroy the dialog on the next do_monitor loop,
	  but this is not the case. The dialog will only be destroyed once
	  the owner is hungup even with the need_destroy flag set. This
	  patch sets the softhangup flag on the ast_channel when a SIP_BYE
	  request is sent as a result of the pending bye flag. ........

	* CHANGES, include/asterisk/translate.h, main/cli.c,
	  main/translate.c: improved translation paths for wideband codecs
	  The problem I'm addressing is that Asterisk's current method of
	  building the least cost translation paths between codecs does not
	  take into account sample rate. For instance, it was possible for
	  siren14 (a 32khz codec), to contain the a translation path to
	  siren7 (a 16khz audio codec) that goes through slin at 8khz. In
	  this case Asterisk takes a 32khz codec, down samples it to 8khz
	  and then up samples it to 16khz which is terrible regardless if
	  it is computationally less expensive. This patch now builds
	  translation paths that give priority to maintaining the best
	  possible sample rate before taking into consideration
	  computational cost. This patch also adds cli commands to expose
	  what translation paths are actually being used. Changes: 1.
	  Translation paths will never contain a step that changes the
	  sample rate unless absolutely necessary. 2. When choosing the
	  best codec to make two channels compatible. Shared codecs with
	  the highest sample rate are given priority. 3. A new cli command
	  to show all translation paths available for a specific codec
	  'core show translation paths [codec name]' has been added. 4.
	  'core show translation' which displays the translation matrix now
	  includes the new higher bit audio codecs in the table. 5. 'core
	  show channel [channel name]' now displays the translation paths
	  if translation is used. (closes issue #16841) Reported by:

	  | 20 lines Ensure SSRC is changed when media source is changed to
	  resolve audio delay. This change causes the SSRC to change right
	  before the channels are bridged, which is what used to happen. It
	  seems that fixes were made to attempt limiting SSRC changes,
	  targeted mainly at sending DTMF. DTMF is not affecting the SSRC
	  with this change. There are two other control frames sent in
	  ast_channel_bridge that probably should also be changed to
	  AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE as well, but I'm going to leave this change
	  up to the discretion of resolving issue #17007. For reference -

	* channels/sig_pri.c, channels/chan_dahdi.c: Fix inband DTMF
	  detection on outgoing ISDN calls. This is a regression from the
	  sig_pri split from chan_dahdi. When a call is first initiated,
	  the inband DTMF detector is not enabled if it's an outgoing ISDN
	  call. However, it needs to be turned on once the media path
	  starts up. This handling was put back in the open_media()
	  callback of chan_dahdi. In sig_pri, open_media() calls were added
	  to a few places where it was needed, including handling of
	  PRI_EVENT_RINGING, PRI_EVENT_PROGRESS, and PRI_EVENT_PROCEEDING.

	* channels/sip/include/sip.h,
	  channels/sip/include/reqresp_parser.h, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c: transaction matching using top
	  most Via header This patch modifies the way chan_sip.c does
	  transaction to dialog matching. Asterisk now stores information
	  in the top most Via header of the initial incoming request and
	  compares that against other Requests that have the same call-id.
	  This results in Asterisk being able to detect a forked call in
	  which it has received multiple legs of the fork. I completely
	  stripped out the previous matching code and made the comparisons
	  a little more explicit and easier to understand. My comments in
	  the code should offer all the details involving this patch. This
	  patch also fixes a bug with the usage of the OBJ-MULTIPLE flag to
	  find multiple dialogs with the same call-id. Since the callback
	  function was returning (CMP_MATCH | CMP_STOP) only the first item
	  found was being returned. I fixed this by making a new callback
	  function for finding multiple dialogs that only returns
	  (CMP_MATCH) on a match allowing for multiple items to be
	  returned. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/776/

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Fix port setting of external address
	  in SIP. There are two changes here: 1. Since the externip setting
	  can now have a port attached to it, calling it "externip" is
	  misleading. The option is now documented and parsed as
	  "externaddr." This also extends to the "matchexterniplocally"
	  setting. It is now documented and parsed as
	  "matchexternaddrlocally." The old names for the options may still
	  be used, but they are no longer used in the sip.conf.sample file.
	  2. If no port is set for the externaddr, and UDP is the transport
	  to be used, then we will set the port of the externaddr to that
	  of the udpbindaddr. This was how things worked prior to the IPv6
	  merge, so this is a regression fix. (closes issue #17665)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix MWI notification transmission problems
	  over SIP. MWI updates were not being sent if no messages were
	  found in the event cache. This was corrected since a phone may
	  need to clear its MWI status configured previously from another
	  mailbox. Upon module or sip reload, MWI updates could not be sent
	  due to the sipsock socket not being set early enough in
	  reload_config. The code handling the descriptor assignment and
	  such has simply been moved before the call to build_peer. Issuing
	  a sip reload cleared the IP address of the peer, but skipped
	  checking the database for registration information. The database
	  is now checked both for sip reload and actually reloading the
	  module. If a transmission occurs before the do_monitor thread has
	  started, do not attempt to send a signal to it. (closes issue

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, main/dnsmgr.c, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  main/acl.c: Fix errors where incorrect address information was
	  printed. ast_sockaddr_stringiy_fmt (which is call by all
	  ast_sockaddr_stringify* functions) uses thread-local storage for
	  storing the string that it creates. In cases where
	  ast_sockaddr_stringify_fmt was being called twice within the same
	  statement, the result of one call would be overwritten by the
	  result of the other call. This usually was happening in
	  printf-like statements and was resulting in the same stringified
	  addressed being printed twice instead of two separate addresses.
	  I have fixed this by using ast_strdupa on the result of stringify
	  functions if they are used twice within the same statement. As
	  far as I could tell, there were no instances where a pointer to
	  the result of such a call were saved anywhere, so this is the
	  only situation I could see where this error could occur.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: handle special case were "200 Ok" to pending
	  INVITE never receives ACK Unlike most responses, the 200 Ok to a
	  pending INVITE Request is acknowledged by an ACK Request. If the
	  ACK Request for this Response is not received the previous
	  behavior was to immediately destroy the dialog and hangup the
	  channel. Now in an effort to be more RFC compliant, instead of
	  immediately destroying the dialog during this special case,
	  termination is done with a BYE Request as the dialog is
	  technically confirmed when the 200 Ok is sent even if the ACK is
	  never received. The behavior of immediately hanging up the
	  channel remains. This only affects how dialog termination
	  proceeds for this one special case. RFC 3261 section 13.3.1.4 "If
	  the server retransmits the 2xx response for 64*T1 seconds without
	  receiving an ACK, the dialog is confirmed, but the session SHOULD
	  be terminated. This is accomplished with a BYE, as described in

	  restructuring The purpose of this patch is to eliminate struct
	  ast_callerid since it has turned into a miscellaneous collection
	  of various party information. Eliminate struct ast_callerid and
	  replace it with the following struct organization: struct
	  ast_party_name { char *str; int char_set; int presentation;
	  unsigned char valid; }; struct ast_party_number { char *str; int
	  plan; int presentation; unsigned char valid; }; struct
	  ast_party_subaddress { char *str; int type; unsigned char
	  odd_even_indicator; unsigned char valid; }; struct ast_party_id {
	  struct ast_party_name name; struct ast_party_number number;
	  struct ast_party_subaddress subaddress; char *tag; }; struct
	  ast_party_dialed { struct { char *str; int plan; } number; struct
	  ast_party_subaddress subaddress; int transit_network_select; };
	  struct ast_party_caller { struct ast_party_id id; char *ani; int
	  ani2; }; The new organization adds some new information as well.
	  * The party name and number now have their own presentation value
	  that can be manipulated independently. ISDN supplies the
	  presentation value for the name and number at different times
	  with the possibility that they could be different. * The party
	  name and number now have a valid flag. Before this change the
	  name or number string could be empty if the presentation were
	  restricted. Most channel drivers assume that the name or number
	  is then simply not available instead of indicating that the name
	  or number was restricted. * The party name now has a character
	  set value. SIP and Q.SIG have the ability to indicate what
	  character set a name string is using so it could be presented
	  properly. * The dialed party now has a numbering plan value that
	  could be useful to have available. The various channel drivers
	  will need to be updated to support the new core features as
	  needed. They have simply been converted to supply current
	  functionality at this time. The following items of note were
	  either corrected or enhanced: * The CONNECTEDLINE() and
	  REDIRECTING() dialplan functions were consolidated into
	  func_callerid.c to share party id handling code. * CALLERPRES()
	  is now deprecated because the name and number have their own
	  presentation values. * Fixed app_alarmreceiver.c
	  write_metadata(). The workstring[] could contain garbage. It also
	  can only contain the caller id number so using
	  ast_callerid_parse() on it is silly. There was also a typo in the
	  CALLERNAME if test. * Fixed app_rpt.c using ast_callerid_parse()
	  on the channel's caller id number string. ast_callerid_parse()
	  alters the given buffer which in this case is the channel's
	  caller id number string. Then using ast_shrink_phone_number()
	  could alter it even more. * Fixed caller ID name and number
	  memory leak in chan_usbradio.c. * Fixed uninitialized char arrays
	  cid_num[] and cid_name[] in sig_analog.c. * Protected access to a
	  caller channel with lock in chan_sip.c. * Clarified intent of
	  code in app_meetme.c sla_ring_station() and dial_trunk(). Also
	  made save all caller ID data instead of just the name and number
	  strings. * Simplified cdr.c set_one_cid(). It hand coded the
	  ast_callerid_merge() function. * Corrected some weirdness with
	  app_privacy.c's use of caller presentation. Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h: chan_sip: RFC
	  compliant retransmission timeout Retransmission of packets should
	  not be based on how many packets were sent, but instead on a
	  timeout period. Depending on whether or not the packet is for a
	  INVITE or NON-INVITE transaction, the number of packets sent
	  during the retransmission timeout period will be different, so
	  timing out based on the number of packets sent is not accurate.
	  This patch fixes this by removing the retransmit limit and only
	  stopping retransmission after a timeout period is reached. By
	  default this timeout period is 64*(Timer T1) for both INVITE and
	  non-INVITE transactions. For more information on sip timer values
	  refer to RFC3261 Appendix A. Review:

	  parsing + new unit test RFC 3261 section 8.2.2.3 states that if
	  any unsupported options are found in the Require header field, a
	  "420 (Bad Extension)" response should be sent with an Unsupported
	  header field containing only the unsupported options. This is not
	  currently being done correctly. Right now, if Asterisk detects
	  any unsupported sip options in a Require header the entire list
	  of options are returned in the Unsupported header even if some of
	  those options are in fact supported. This patch fixes that by
	  building an unsupported options character buffer when parsing the
	  options that can be sent with the 420 response. A unit test
	  verifying this functionality has been created. Some code
	  refactoring was required. Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: more accurate retransmissions
	  RFC3261 states that Timer A should start at 500ms (T1) by
	  default. In chan_sip this value initially started at 1000ms and I
	  changed it to 500ms recently. After doing that I noticed in my
	  packet captures that it still occasionally retransmitted starting
	  at 1000ms instead of 500ms like I told it to. This occurs because
	  the scheduler runs in the do_monitor thread. If a new
	  retransmission is added while the do_monitor thread is sleeping
	  then it may not detect that retransmission for nearly 1000ms. To
	  fix this I just poke the do_monitor thread to wake up when a new
	  packet is sent reliably requiring retransmits. The thread then
	  detects the new scheduler entry and adjusts its sleep time to
	  account for it. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/747

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Resolve some errors produced during module
	  unload of chan_iax2. The external test suite stops Asterisk using
	  the "core stop gracefully" command. The logs from the tests show
	  that there are a number of problems with Asterisk trying to
	  cleanly shut down. This patch addresses the following type of
	  error that comes from chan_iax2: [Jun 22 16:58:11] ERROR[29884]:
	  lock.c:129 __ast_pthread_mutex_destroy: chan_iax2.c line 11371

	  &thread->lock: Device or resource busy For an example in the
	  context of a build, see:
	  http://bamboo.asterisk.org/browse/AST-TRUNK-739/log The primary
	  purpose of this patch is to change the thread pool shutdown
	  procedure to be more explicit to ensure that the thread exits
	  from a point where it is not holding a lock. While testing that,
	  I encountered various crashes due to the order of operations in
	  unload_module() being problematic. I reordered some things there,
	  as well. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/736/

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add extra protection for reinvite glare
	  scenario. Testing proved that if Asterisk sent a connected line
	  reinvite, and the endpoint to which the reinvite were being sent
	  sent a reinvite, Asterisk would not properly respond with a 491
	  response. The reason is that on connected line reinvites, we set
	  the dialog's invitestate to INV_CALLING to prevent Asterisk from
	  sending a rapid flurry of connected line reinvites. For other
	  reinvites we do not do this. Because of the current invitestate,
	  when Asterisk received the reinvite, we interpreted this as a
	  spiraled INVITE, and thus did not behave properly. The fix for
	  this is to not enter the loop detection or spiral logic in
	  handle_request_invite if the channel state is currently up. This
	  way, no mid-call reinvites will be misinterpreted, no matter what
	  the nature of the reinvite may have been.

	* channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c: fixes some coding guideline issue

	* channels/sip/include/dialog.h, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: retransmit response to BYE requests
	  until timer J expires According to RFC 3261 section 17.2.2, which
	  describes non-INVITE server transaction, when a dialog enters the
	  Completed state it must destroy the dialog after Timer J (T1*64)
	  fires. For a BYE transaction Asterisk terminates the dialog
	  immediately during sip_hangup() when it should be waiting T1*64
	  ms. This results in some odd behavior. For instance if Asterisk
	  receives a BYE and transmits a 200ok in response, if the endpoint
	  never receives the 200ok it will retransmit the BYE to which
	  Asterisk responds with a "481 Call leg/transaction does not
	  exist" because the dialog is already gone. To resolve this I made
	  a function called sip_scheddestroy_final(). This differs slightly
	  from sip_schedestroy() in that it enables a flag that will
	  prevent the destruction from ever being rescheduled or canceled
	  afterwards. It also prevents the pvt's needdestroy flag from
	  being set which triggers the destruction of the dialog within the
	  do_monitor thread(). By using this function we are guaranteed
	  destruction will not occur until the scheduled time. This allows
	  Asterisk to respond to any possible retransmits for a dialog
	  after we process the initial BYE request for T1*64 ms. Other
	  changes: I removed two instances where sip_cancel_destroy is used
	  right before calling sip_scheddestroy. sip_scheddestroy always
	  calls sip_cancel_destroy before scheduling the new destruction so
	  it is completely unnecessary. Review:

	  Jun 2010) | 22 lines fixes chan_iax2 race condition There is code
	  in chan_iax2.c that attempts to guarantee that only a single
	  active thread will handle a call number at a time. This code
	  works once the thread is added to an active_list of threads, but
	  we are not currently guaranteed that a newly activated thread
	  will enter the active_list immediately because it is left up to
	  the thread to add itself after frames have been queued to it.
	  This means that if two frames come in for the same call number at
	  the same time, it is possible for them to grab two separate
	  threads because the first thread did not add itself to the
	  active_list fast enough. This causes some pretty complex
	  problems. This patch resolves this race condition by immediately
	  adding an activated thread to the active_list within the network
	  thread and only depending on the thread to remove itself once it
	  is done processing the frames queued to it. By doing this we are
	  guaranteed that if another frame for the same call number comes
	  in at the same time, that this thread will immediately be found
	  in the active_list of threads. Review:

	  on a PLC-enabled channel. The issue here was that the frame
	  created when adjusting for PLC had no offset to its audio data.
	  If this frame were translated to another format prior to being
	  sent out an RTP socket, all went well because the translation
	  code would put an appropriate offset into the frame. However, if
	  the SLIN audio were not translated before being sent out the RTP
	  socket, bad things would happen. Specifically, the
	  ast_rtp_raw_write makes the assumption that the frame has at
	  least enough of an offset that it can accommodate an RTP header.
	  This was not the case. As such, data was being written prior to
	  the allocation, likely corrupting the data the memory allocator
	  had written. Thus when the time came to free the data, all hell
	  broke loose. ....Well, Asterisk crashed at least. The fix was
	  just what one would expect. Offset the data in the frame by a
	  reasonable amount. The method I used is a bit odd since the data
	  in the frame is 16 bit integers and not bytes. I left a big ol'
	  comment about it. This can be improved on if someone is
	  interested. I was more interested in getting the crash resolved.

	  while the owner pointers are in a potentially inconsistent state
	  is a potentially bad thing in principle. However, calling
	  dahdi_indicate() when the channel private lock is already held
	  can cause a deadlock if the PRI lock is needed because
	  dahdi_indicate() will also get the channel private lock. The
	  pri_grab() function assumes that the channel private lock is held
	  once to avoid deadlock.

	  dial by name in chan_dahdi * chan_dahdi supports dialing
	  configuring and dialing by device file name.
	  DAHDI/span-name!local!1 will use /dev/dahdi/span-name/local/1 .
	  Likewise it may appear in chan_dahdi.conf as 'channel =>

	  chan_dahdi will ignore failed 'channel' entries. Handy for the
	  above name-based syntax as it does not depend on initialization

	* channels/chan_sip.c: fixes compile error from uninitialized
	  variable

	* channels/chan_sip.c: RFC3261 compliant sip unreliable retransmit
	  timing + 'registerattempts' option tweak Changes. 1. RFC 3261
	  states in section 17.1.2.2 and 17.1.1.2 that retransmission
	  timers should initially be set to timer T1. T1 by default is
	  500ms. Asterisk was starting the retransmission timers at T1*2
	  which shouldn't cause any problems, but is not RFC compliant. 2.
	  RFC 3261 states in section 17.1.2.2 that for a non-INVITE client
	  transaction, if the retransmit timer fires while in the
	  proceeding state that the request must be retransmitted. Asterisk
	  currently ack's requests for both INVITE and non-INVITE
	  transactions when a 1XX response is received, this patch changes
	  this for non-INVITE requests. 3. The 'registerattempts' option in
	  sip.conf is supposed to set how many registry attempts will be
	  made before giving up. When this option is set to 1, I would
	  expect only one registry attempt to be made before stopping
	  because of a failure, but instead two are made. In my opinion
	  this is not expected behavior. This option does not indicate that
	  these are re-attempts. The logic behind this option has been
	  changed to only attempt registers the exact number of times this
	  option is set to. If this option is 0, it still continues to
	  re-attempt the registration forever. Review:

	  __ast_channel_alloc_ap() has several points in the initialization

	  structure is now an ao2 object, the destructor callback needs to
	  be able to handle clean up when the structure setup is
	  incomplete. Problems corrected: 1) Failing to setup the alertpipe
	  would not unreference the structure but free it directly. Doing
	  this to an ao2_object is very bad. 2) File descriptors need to be
	  initialized to -1 before a construction failure could occur so
	  the destructor will not close unopened descriptors. 3) The
	  destructor needs to check that the string field has been
	  initialized before using any string field values. Crashes
	  expected. 4) The destructor should not notify devstate if the
	  device name is empty. It is a waste of cycles and a couple ERROR
	  log messages are generated. Review:

	  frames until after the sleep has concluded. From reviewboard
	  Background: A Digium customer discovered a somewhat odd bug. The
	  setup is that parties A and B are bridged, and party A places
	  party B on hold. While party B is listening to hold music, he
	  mashes a bunch of DTMF. Party A takes party B off hold while this
	  is happening, but party B continues to hear hold music. I could
	  reproduce this about 1 in 5 times. The issue: When DTMF features
	  are enabled and a user presses keys, the channel that the DTMF is
	  streamed to is placed in an ast_safe_sleep for 100 ms, the
	  duration of the emulated tone. If an AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD frame is
	  read from the channel during the sleep, the frame is dropped.
	  Thus the unhold indication is never made to the channel that was
	  originally placed on hold. The fix: Originally, I discussed with
	  Kevin possible ways of fixing the specific problem reported.
	  However, we determined that the same type of problem could happen
	  in other situations where ast_safe_sleep() is used. Using
	  autoservice as a model, I modified ast_safe_sleep_conditional()
	  to defer specific frame types so they can be re-queued once the
	  sleep has finished. I made a common function for determining if a
	  frame should be deferred so that there are not two identical
	  switch blocks to maintain. Review:

	* main/channel.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/_private.h,
	  include/asterisk/options.h, main/asterisk.c, main/loader.c: Fix
	  transcode_via_sln option with SIP calls and improve PLC usage.
	  From reviewboard: The problem here is a bit complex, so try to
	  bear with me... It was noticed by a Digium customer that generic
	  PLC (as configured in codecs.conf) did not appear to actually be
	  having any sort of benefit when packet loss was introduced on an
	  RTP stream. I reproduced this issue myself by streaming a file
	  across an RTP stream and dropping approx. 5% of the RTP packets.
	  I saw no real difference between when PLC was enabled or disabled
	  when using wireshark to analyze the RTP streams. After analyzing
	  what was going on, it became clear that one of the problems faced
	  was that when running my tests, the translation paths were being
	  set up in such a way that PLC could not possibly work as
	  expected. To illustrate, if packets are lost on channel A's read
	  stream, then we expect that PLC will be applied to channel B's
	  write stream. The problem is that generic PLC can only be done
	  when there is a translation path that moves from some codec to
	  SLINEAR. When I would run my tests, I found that every single
	  time, read and write translation paths would be set up on channel
	  A instead of channel B. There appeared to be no real way to
	  predict which channel the translation paths would be set up on.
	  This is where Kevin swooped in to let me know about the
	  transcode_via_sln option in asterisk.conf. It is supposed to work
	  by placing a read translation path on both channels from the
	  channel's rawreadformat to SLINEAR. It also will place a write
	  translation path on both channels from SLINEAR to the channel's
	  rawwriteformat. Using this option allows one to predictably set
	  up translation paths on all channels. There are two problems with
	  this, though. First and foremost, the transcode_via_sln option
	  did not appear to be working properly when I was placing a SIP
	  call between two endpoints which did not share any common
	  formats. Second, even if this option were to work, for PLC to be
	  applied, there had to be a write translation path that would go
	  from some format to SLINEAR. It would not work properly if the
	  starting format of translation was SLINEAR. The one-line change
	  presented in this review request in chan_sip.c fixed the first
	  issue for me. The problem was that in sip_request_call, the
	  jointcapability of the outbound channel was being set to the
	  format passed to sip_request_call. This is nativeformats of the
	  inbound channel. Because of this, when
	  ast_channel_make_compatible was called by app_dial, both channels
	  already had compatibly read and write formats. Thus, no
	  translation path was set up at the time. My change is to set the
	  jointcapability of the sip_pvt created during sip_request_call to
	  the intersection of the inbound channel's nativeformats and the
	  configured peer capability that we determined during the earlier
	  call to create_addr. Doing this got the translation paths set up
	  as expected when using transcode_via_sln. The changes presented
	  in channel.c fixed the second issue for me. First and foremost,
	  when Asterisk is started, we'll read codecs.conf to see the value
	  of the genericplc option. If this option is set, and ast_write is
	  called for a frame with no data, then we will attempt to fill in
	  the missing samples for the frame. The implementation uses a
	  channel datastore for maintaining the PLC state and for creating
	  a buffer to store PLC samples in. Even when we receive a frame
	  with data, we'll call plc_rx so that the PLC state will have
	  knowledge of the previous voice frame, which it can use as a
	  basis for when it comes time to actually do a PLC fill-in. So,
	  reviewers, now I ask for your help. First off, there's the one
	  line change in chan_sip that I have put in. Is it right? By my
	  logic it seems correct, but I'm sure someone can tell me why it
	  is not going to work. This is probably the change I'm least
	  concerned about, though. What concerns me much more is the set of
	  changes in channel.c. First off, am I even doing it right? When I
	  run tests, I can clearly see that when PLC is activated, I see a
	  significant increase in RTP traffic where I would expect it to
	  be. However, in my humble opinion, the audio sounds kind of
	  crappy whenever the PLC fill-in is done. It sounds worse to me
	  than when no PLC is used at all. I need someone to review the
	  logic I have used to be sure that I'm not misusing anything. As
	  far as I can see my pointer arithmetic is correct, and my use of
	  AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET should be correct as well, but I'm sure
	  someone can point out somewhere where I've done something
	  incorrectly. As I was writing this review request up, I decided
	  to give the code a test run under valgrind, and I find that for
	  some reason, calls to plc_rx are causing some invalid reads.
	  Apparently I'm reading past the end of a buffer somehow. I'll
	  have to dig around a bit to see why that is the case. If it's
	  obvious to someone reviewing, speak up! Finally, I have one other
	  proposal that is not reflected in my code review. Since without
	  transcode_via_sln set, one cannot predict or control where a
	  translation path will be up, it seems to me that the current
	  practice of using PLC only when transcoding to SLINEAR is not
	  useful. I recommend that once it has been determined that the
	  method used in this code review is correct and works as expected,
	  then the code in translate.c that invokes PLC should be removed.

	  funcs/func_callerid.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h: Enhancements
	  to connected line and redirecting work. From reviewboard: Digium
	  has a commercial customer who has made extensive use of the
	  connected party and redirecting information present in later
	  versions of Asterisk Business Edition and which is to be in the
	  upcoming 1.8 release. Through their use of the feature, new
	  problems and solutions have come about. This patch adds several
	  enhancements to maximize usage of the connected party and
	  redirecting information functionality. First, Asterisk trunk
	  already had connected line interception macros. These macros
	  allow you to manipulate connected line information before it was
	  sent out to its target. This patch adds the same feature except
	  for redirecting information instead. Second, the ast_callerid and
	  ast_party_id structures have been enhanced to provide a "tag."
	  This tag can be set with func_callerid, func_connectedline,
	  func_redirecting, and in the case of DAHDI, mISDN, and SIP
	  channels, can be set in a configuration file. The idea behind the
	  callerid tag is that it can be set to whatever value the
	  administrator likes. Later, when running connected line and
	  redirecting macros, the admin can read the tag off the
	  appropriate structure to determine what action to take. You can
	  think of this sort of like a channel variable, except that
	  instead of having the variable associated with a channel, the
	  variable is associated with a specific identity within Asterisk.
	  Third, app_dial has two new options, s and u. The s option lets a
	  dialplan writer force a specific caller ID tag to be placed on
	  the outgoing channel. The u option allows the dialplan writer to
	  force a specific calling presentation value on the outgoing
	  channel. Fourth, there is a new control frame subclass called
	  AST_CONTROL_READ_ACTION added. This was added to correct a very
	  specific situation. In the case of SIP semi-attended (blond)
	  transfers, the party being transferred would not have the
	  opportunity to run a connected line interception macro to
	  possibly alter the transfer target's connected line information.
	  The issue here was that during a blond transfer, the SIP transfer
	  code has no bridged channel on which to queue the connected line
	  update. The way this was corrected was to add this new control
	  frame subclass. Now, we queue an AST_CONTROL_READ_ACTION frame on
	  the channel on which the connected line interception macro should
	  be run. When ast_read is called to read the frame, ast_read
	  responds by calling a callback function associated with the
	  specific read action the control frame describes. In this case,
	  the action taken is to run the connected line interception macro
	  on the transferee's channel. Review:

	  to external (PSTN). In that case this is the only way to get rid

	  have to be at their own extension to clear their voicemail, they
	  have no way of escaping VoicemailMain to allow entry of new

	  test_heap.diff uploaded by cappucinoking (license 1036) Tested
	  by: cappucinoking, russell

	* main/heap.c: Fix handling of removing nodes from the middle of a
	  heap. This bug surfaced in 1.6.2 and does not affect code in any
	  other released version of Asterisk. It manifested itself as SIP
	  qualify not happening when it should, causing peers to go
	  unreachable. This was debugged down to scheduler entries
	  sometimes not getting executed when they were supposed to, which
	  was in turn caused by an error in the heap code. The problem only
	  sometimes occurs, and it is due to the logic for removing an
	  entry in the heap from an arbitrary location (not just popping
	  off the top). The scheduler performs this operation frequently
	  when entries are removed before they run (when ast_sched_del() is
	  used). In a normal pop off of the top of the heap, a node is
	  taken off the bottom, placed at the top, and then bubbled down
	  until the max heap property is restored (see max_heapify()). This
	  same logic was used for removing an arbitrary node from the
	  middle of the heap. Unfortunately, that logic is full of fail.
	  This patch fixes that by fully restoring the max heap property
	  when a node is thrown into the middle of the heap. Instead of
	  just pushing it down as appropriate, it first pushes it up as
	  high as it will go, and _then_ pushes it down. Lastly, fix a
	  minor problem in ast_heap_verify(), which is only used for
	  debugging. If a parent and child node have the same value, that
	  is not an error. The only error is if a parent's value is less
	  than its children. A huge thanks goes out to cappucinoking for
	  debugging this down to the scheduler, and then producing an
	  ast_heap test case that demonstrated the breakage. That made it
	  very easy for me to focus on the heap logic and produce a fix.
	  Open source projects are awesome. (closes issue #16936) Reported

	  | 33 lines resolves deadlocks in chan_local Issue_1. In the
	  local_hangup() 3 locks must be held at the same time... pvt,
	  pvt->chan, and pvt->owner. Proper deadlock avoidance is done when
	  the channel to hangup is the outbound chan_local channel, but
	  when it is not the outbound channel we have an issue... We
	  attempt to do deadlock avoidance only on the tech pvt, when both
	  the tech pvt and the pvt->owner are locked coming into that loop.
	  By never giving up the pvt->owner channel deadlock avoidance is
	  not entirely possible. This patch resolves that by doing deadlock
	  avoidance on both the pvt->owner and the pvt when trying to get
	  the pvt->chan lock. Issue_2. ast_prod() is used in
	  ast_activate_generator() to queue a frame on the channel and make
	  the channel's read function get called. This function is used in
	  ast_activate_generator() while the channel is locked, which
	  mean's the channel will have a lock both from the generator code
	  and the frame_queue code by the time it gets to chan_local.c's
	  local_queue_frame code... local_queue_frame contains some of the
	  same crazy deadlock avoidance that local_hangup requires, and
	  this recursive lock prevents that deadlock avoidance from
	  happening correctly. This patch removes ast_prod() from the
	  channel lock so only one lock is held during the
	  local_queue_frame function. (closes issue #17185) Reported by:

	  'fax show sessions', the 'Type' column has been renamed to 'Tech'
	  and replaced with a new 'Tech' column that will report 'G.711' or
	  'T.38'. Control of ECM defaults has been added to res_fax A 'fax

	* tests/test_event.c, main/event.c: Add ast_event subscription unit
	  test and fix some ast_event API bugs. This patch introduces
	  another test in test_event.c that exercises most of the
	  subscription related ast_event API calls. I made some minor
	  additions to the existing event allocation test to increase API
	  coverage by the test code. Finally, I made a list in a comment of
	  API calls not yet touched by the test module as a to-do list for
	  future test development. During the development of this test
	  code, I discovered a number of bugs in the event API. 1)
	  subscriptions to AST_EVENT_ALL were not handled appropriately in
	  a couple of different places. The API allows a subscription to
	  all event types, but with IE parameters, just as if it was a
	  subscription to a specific event type. However, the parameters
	  were being ignored. This affected ast_event_check_subscriber()
	  and event distribution to subscribers. 2) Some of the logic in
	  ast_event_check_subscriber() for checking subscriptions against
	  query parameters was wrong. Review:

	  frames faster Mantis issue 17078 reports MixMonitor recordings
	  have shorter durations than the call duration. This was because
	  the mixmonitor thread was not processing frames from the
	  audiohook fast enough. The mixmonitor thread would slowly fall
	  behind the most recent audio frame and when the channel hangs up,
	  the mixmonitor thread would exit without processing the same
	  number of frames as the channel; leaving the mixmonitor recording
	  shorter than actual call duration. This revision fixes this issue
	  by moving the ast_audiohook_trigger_wait() and the subsequent
	  audiohook.status check into the block where the

	* main/ccss.c: Fix issue where recall would not happen when it
	  should. Specifically, the situation would happen when multiple
	  callers would request CC for a single generically-monitored
	  device. If the monitored device became available but the caller
	  did not answer the recall, then there was nothing that would poke
	  the CC core to let it know that it should attempt to recall
	  someone else instead. After careful consideration, I came to the
	  conclusion that the only area of Asterisk that needed to be
	  touched was the generic CC monitor. All other types of CC would
	  require something outside of Asterisk to invoke a recall for a
	  separate device. This was accomplished by changing the generic
	  monitor destructor to poke other generic monitor instances if the
	  device is currently available and the specific instance was
	  currently not suspended. In order to not accidentally trigger
	  recalls at bad times, the fit_for_recall flag was also added to
	  the generic_monitor_instance_list struct. This gets set as soon
	  as a monitored device becomes available. It gets cleared if a
	  CCNR request triggers the creation of a new generic monitor
	  instance. By doing this, we don't accidentally try to recall a
	  device when the monitored device was being monitored for CCNR and
	  never actually became available for recall in the first place.
	  This error was discovered by Steve Pitts during in-house testing
	  at Digium.

	  trunk. From Reviewboard: CCSS stands for Call Completion
	  Supplementary Services. An admittedly out-of-date overview of the
	  architecture can be found in the file doc/CCSS_architecture.pdf
	  in the CCSS branch. Off the top of my head, the big differences
	  between what is implemented and what is in the document are as
	  follows: 1. We did not end up modifying the Hangup application at
	  all. 2. The document states that a single call completion monitor
	  may be used across multiple calls to the same device. This proved
	  to not be such a good idea when implementing protocol-specific
	  monitors, and so we ended up using one monitor per-device
	  per-call. 3. There are some configuration options which were
	  conceived after the document was written. These are documented in
	  the ccss.conf.sample that is on this review request. For some
	  basic understanding of terminology used throughout this code, see
	  the ccss.tex document that is on this review. This implements
	  CCBS and CCNR in several flavors. First up is a "generic"
	  implementation, which can work over any channel technology
	  provided that the channel technology can accurately report device
	  state. Call completion is requested using the dialplan
	  application CallCompletionRequest and can be canceled using
	  CallCompletionCancel. Device state subscriptions are used in
	  order to monitor the state of called parties. Next, there is a
	  SIP-specific implementation of call completion. This method uses
	  the methods outlined in draft-ietf-bliss-call-completion-06 to
	  implement call completion using SIP signaling. There are a few
	  things to note here: * The agent/monitor terminology used
	  throughout Asterisk sometimes is the reverse of what is defined
	  in the referenced draft. * Implementation of the draft required
	  support for SIP PUBLISH. I attempted to write this in a
	  generic-enough fashion such that if someone were to want to write
	  PUBLISH support for other event packages, such as dialog-state or
	  presence, most of the effort would be in writing callbacks
	  specific to the event package. * A subportion of supporting
	  PUBLISH reception was that we had to implement a PIDF parser. The
	  PIDF support added is a bit minimal. I first wrote a validation
	  routine to ensure that the PIDF document is formatted properly.
	  The rest of the PIDF reading is done in-line in the
	  call-completion-specific PUBLISH-handling code. In other words,
	  while there is PIDF support here, it is not in any state where it
	  could easily be applied to other event packages as is. Finally,
	  there are a variety of ISDN-related call completion protocols
	  supported. These were written by Richard Mudgett, and as such I
	  can't really say much about their implementation. There are notes
	  in the CHANGES file that indicate the ISDN protocols over which
	  call completion is supported. Review:

	* main/srv.c, channels/chan_sip.c, funcs/func_srv.c (added),
	  CHANGES, include/asterisk/srv.h: func_srv and explicit
	  specification of a remote IP for SIP. From Review Board: There
	  are two interrelated changes here. First, there is the
	  introduction of func_srv. This adds two new read-only dialplan
	  functions, SRVQUERY and SRVRESULT. They work very similarly to
	  the ENUMQUERY and ENUMRESULT functions, except that this allows
	  one to query SRV records instead. In order to facilitate this
	  work, I added a couple of new API calls to srv.h.
	  ast_srv_get_record_count tells the number of records returned by
	  an SRV lookup. This number is calculated at the time of the SRV
	  lookup. ast_srv_get_nth_record allows one to get a numbered SRV
	  record. Second, there is the modification to chan_sip that allows
	  one to specify a hostname or IP address (along with a port) to
	  send an outgoing INVITE to when dialing a SIP peer. This goes
	  hand-in-hand with func_srv. You can query SRV records and then
	  use the host and port from the results to dial via a specific
	  host instead of what is configured in sip.conf. Review:

	* /, Makefile.rules, build_tools/make_linker_version_script: Ensure
	  that linker version scripts (used for symbol export control)
	  always exist. Using wildcard matching in the Makefile is not
	  adequate to determine whether an export file should exist for a
	  module or not, so instead we'll just create one if the module
	  needs one, or copy the default one if it does not.

	  addresses is used to determine whether we would allow those

	  2010) | 44 lines Several fixes regarding RFC2833 DTMF detection.
	  Here is a copy and paste of the details from my request on
	  reviewboard that dealt with these changes: Fix 1. The first
	  change in place is to fix Mantis issue 15811, which deals with a
	  situation where Asterisk will incorrectly interpret out of order
	  RFC2833 frames as duplicate DTMF digits. For instance, we would
	  receive a sequence like: seqno 1: DTMF 1 seqno 2: DTMF 1 seqno 3:
	  DTMF 1 seqno 4: DTMF 1 seqno 6: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 5: DTMF 1
	  seqno 7: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 8: DTMF 1 (end) Prior to this patch
	  when we received the frame with seqno 5, we would interpret this
	  as a new DTMF 1. With this patch, we will check the seqno of the
	  incoming digit and not process the frame if the seqno is lower
	  than the last recorded seqno. Note that we do not record the
	  seqno of the dropped DTMF frame for future processing. While the
	  above situation is what was designed to be fixed, the patch is
	  written in such a way that the following would also be fixed too:
	  seqno 9: DTMF 1 seqno 10: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 11: DTMF 1 (end)
	  seqno 13: DTMF 2 seqno 12: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 14: DTMF 2 seqno
	  15: DTMF 2 (end) seqno 16: DTMF 2 (end) seqno 17: DTMF 2 (end) In
	  this second situation, the beginning of the DTMF 2 arrives before
	  the final end frame of the DTMF 1. With the patch, seqno 12 is no
	  processed and thus we properly interpret the DTMF. Fix 2. The
	  second change in place is to fix an issue like the following:
	  seqno 1: DTMF 1 seqno 2: DTMF 1 seqno 3: DTMF 1 (end) *packet
	  lost* seqno 4: DTMF 1 (end) *packet lost* seqno 5: DTMF 1 (end)
	  *packet lost* seqno 6: DTMF 2 When we receive seqno 6, we had
	  code in place that was supposed to properly end the previously
	  unended DTMF 1. The problem was that the code was essentially a
	  no-op. The code would set up an end frame for the DTMF 1 but
	  would immediately overwrite the frame with the begin for DTMF 2.
	  I changed process_dtmf_rfc2833() so that instead of returning a
	  single frame, it is given as an output parameter a list of
	  frames. Each frame that needs to be returned is appended to this
	  list. Fix 3. The final change is a minor one where an
	  AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE frame could get lost. If we process a cisco
	  DTMF or an RFC 3389 frame and no frame was returned, then we
	  would return &ast_null_frame. The problem is that earlier in the
	  function, we may have generated an AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE frame
	  and put it in the list of frames we wish to return. This frame
	  would be lost in such a case. The patch fixes this problem

	* main/channel.c, channels/chan_sip.c, res/res_fax.c,
	  configs/sip.conf.sample, include/asterisk/frame.h,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Improve handling of T.38 re-INVITEs
	  that arrive before a T.38-capable application is executing on a
	  channel. This patch addresses an issue found during working with
	  end-users using res_fax. If an incoming call is answered in the
	  dialplan, or jumps to the 'fax' extension due to reception of a
	  CNG tone (with faxdetect enabled), and then the remote endpoint
	  sends a T.38 re-INVITE, it is possible for the channel's T.38
	  state to be 'T38_STATE_NEGOTIATING' when the application starts
	  up. Unfortunately, even if the application wants to use T.38, it
	  can't respond to the peer's negotiation request, because the
	  AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS control frame that chan_sip sent
	  originally has been lost, and the application needs the content
	  of that frame to be able to formulate a reply. This patch adds a
	  new 'request' type to AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS,
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS. If the application sends this request,
	  chan_sip will re-send the original control frame (with
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_NEGOTIATE as the request type), and the
	  application can respond as normal. If this occurs within the five
	  second timeout in chan_sip, the automatic cancellation of the
	  peer reinvite will be stopped, and the application will 'own' the
	  negotiation process from that point onwards. This also improves
	  the code path in chan_sip to allow sip_indicate(), when called
	  for AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS, to be able to return a non-zero
	  response, which should have been in place before since the
	  control frame *can* fail to be processed properly. It also
	  modifies ast_indicate() to return whatever result the channel
	  driver returned for this control frame, rather than converting
	  all non-zero results into '-1'. Finally, the new request type
	  intentionally returns a positive value, so that an application
	  that sends AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS can know for certain whether the
	  channel driver accepted it and will be replying with a control
	  frame of its own, or whether it was ignored (if the
	  sip_indicate()/ast_indicate() path had properly supported failure
	  responses before, this would not be necessary). This patch also
	  modifies res_fax to take advantage of the new request. In
	  addition, this patch makes sip_t38_abort() actually lock the
	  private structure before doing its work... bad programmer, no
	  donut. This patch also enhances chan_sip's 'faxdetect' support to
	  allow triggering on T.38 re-INVITEs received as well as CNG tone
	  detection. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/556/

	* main/pbx.c: Fix potential invalid reads that could occur in pbx.c
	  Here is a cut and paste of my review request for this change:
	  This past weekend, Russell ran our current suite of unit tests
	  for Asterisk under valgrind. The PBX pattern match test caused
	  valgrind to spew forth two invalid read errors. This patch
	  contains two changes that shut valgrind up and do not cause any
	  new memory leaks. Change 1: In
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2, valgrind reported an
	  invalid read in the for loop close to the function's end.
	  Specifically, one of the the strcmp calls in the loop control was
	  reading invalid memory. This was because the caller of
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2 (__ast_context destroy in
	  this case) passed as a parameter a shallow copy of an ast_exten's
	  exten field. This same ast_exten was what was destroyed inside
	  the for loop, thus any iterations of the for loop beyond the
	  destruction of the ast_exten would result in invalid reads. My
	  fix for this is to make a copy of the ast_exten's exten field and
	  pass the copy to ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2. In
	  addition, I have also acted similarly with the ast_exten's
	  matchcid field. Since in this case a NULL is handled quite
	  differently than an empty string, I needed to be a bit more
	  careful with its handling. Change 2: In __ast_context_destroy, we
	  iterated over a hashtab and called
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2 on each item.
	  Specifically, the hashtab over which we were iterating was an
	  ast_exten's peer_table. Inside of
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2, we could possibly destroy
	  this ast_exten, which also caused the hashtab to be freed.
	  Attempting to call ast_hashtab_end_traversal on the hashtab
	  iterator caused an invalid read to occur when trying to read the
	  iterator->tab->do_locking field since iterator->tab had already
	  been freed. My handling of this problem is a bit less
	  straightforward. With each iteration over the hashtab's contents,
	  we set a variable called "end_traversal" based on the return of
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2. If 0 is ever returned,
	  then we know that the extension was found and destroyed. Because
	  of this, we cannot call ast_hashtab_end_traversal because we will
	  be guaranteeing a read of invalid memory. In such a case, we
	  forego calling ast_hashtab_end_traversal and instead call
	  ast_free on the hashtab iterator. Review:

	  that source file is included in. With examples like chan_sip,
	  chan_iax2, chan_misdn and others consisting of multiple source
	  files, this will not lead to the behavior that users expect. If
	  they want to set the debug level for chan_sip, they want it set
	  for all of chan_sip, and not to have to also set it for
	  reqresp_parser and other files that comprise the chan_sip module.
	  This patch changes this functionality to be module-name based
	  instead of file-name based. To make this work, some Makefile
	  modifications were required to ensure that the AST_MODULE

	  updating of the RTP synchronization source to only those times
	  when we detect that the other side of the conversation has
	  changed the ssrc. The problem is that SRCUPDATE control frames
	  are sent many times where we don't want a new ssrc, including
	  whenever Asterisk has to send DTMF in a normal bridge. This is
	  also not the first time that this mistake has been made. The
	  initial implementation of the ast_rtp_new_source function also
	  changed the ssrc--and then it was removed because of this same
	  issue. Then, we put it back in again to fix a different issue.
	  This patch attempts to only change the ssrc when we see that the
	  other side of the conversation has changed the ssrc. It also
	  renames some functions to make their purpose more clear. Review:

	  following: 1. Basic allocation and setting of string fields. 2.
	  Shrinking a string field and re-expanding it. 3. Growing the last
	  allocation in a string field pool. 4. Setting a string to a large
	  value such that a new string field pool must be allocated. In
	  each part, we make sure that the string field is accurate (has
	  the correct value in it), make sure that the 2 bytes before the
	  string field has the correct capacity for the field, and for
	  tests 2-4, we make sure that the string field is where we expect
	  it to be in memory. Also tested: 5. Shrinking a string field and
	  partially re-expanding it. 6. Setting strings in such a way as to
	  create three separate string field pools and then removing the
	  middle pool. There is a bug fix in the init function, which
	  ensures the embedded_pool is set to NULL which is important for
	  stack allocated structures. Review:

	  all to match. The wording in 1.6.2 and trunk was ambiguous, so
	  you could interpret the wording the mean that recording would
	  continue upon hangup indefinitely, or you could interpret it to
	  mean that the recorded data would not be discarded upon hangup.
	  This change makes it clear we mean the latter, and not the
	  former. Came from a discussion in #asterisk on IRC.

	  it would cause the search for a call waiting interface to be very
	  expensive and slow down D channel message servicing.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a crash in SIP blind transfer handling
	  found by an automated external test. The first real test added to
	  the external test suite found a pretty nasty crash that occurred
	  in Asterisk trunk. The crash was due to a race condition between
	  the REFER handling and channel destruction in the channel thread.
	  After the transfer has been completed, we go back to the
	  transferrer channel and try to lock it so we can fire off a CEL
	  event. However, there was no guarantee that the channel was still
	  around at that point since it's racing against the channel
	  thread. Since ast_channel is a reference counted object, the fix
	  is simple. The code unlocks the transferrer channel before
	  finally completing the transfer with an async goto. At this point
	  the channel thread is going to start call tear down and the
	  channel will eventually be destroyed. To ensure that the channel
	  is valid when we want to fire off the CEL event, increase the
	  channel's reference count.

	  From the issue: The automatic overnight line tests (or manual
	  ones) used on UK (BT) lines causes a red alarm on a dahdi /
	  TDM400P connected channel. This is because the line uses voltage
	  tests (battery loss) and polarity reversal. The polarity reversal
	  causes chan_dahdi to initiate v23 CallerID processing but during
	  this the event DAHDI_EVENT_NOALARM is ignored so that the alarm
	  is never cleared. (closes issue #14163) Reported by: jedi98

	  While we could create it in the init script, that would not work

	  the safest thing to do is to create it as part of the Asterisk
	  boot process. This also changes the ownership of the directory,

	  19 Feb 2010) | 49 lines Make chan_misdn DTMF processing
	  consistent with other channel technologies. The processing of
	  DTMF tones on the receiving side of an ISDN channel is
	  inconsistent with the way it is handled in other channels,
	  especially DAHDI analog. This causes DTMF tones sent from an ISDN
	  phone to be doubled at the connected party. We are using the
	  following 2 options of misdn.conf 1) astdtmf=yes 2) senddtmf=yes
	  Option one is necessary because the asterisk DSP DTMF detection
	  is better than mISDN's internal DSP. Not as many false positives.
	  Option two is necessary to transmit DTMF tones end to end when
	  mISDN channels are connected to SIP channels with out of band
	  DTMF for example. The symptom is that DTMF tones sent by an ISDN
	  phone are doubled on the way through asterisk when two mISDN
	  channels are connected with a Local channel in between or if it
	  is bridged to an analog channel. The doubling of DTMF tones is
	  because DTMF is passed inband to asterisk by the mISDN channel
	  and passed out of band once again after the release of the DTMF
	  tone. Passing it inband is wrong. Neither an analog channel nor
	  SIP channel passes DTMF inband if configured to inband DTMF.
	  Analog and SIP channels filter out the DTMF tones because they
	  use the voice frames returned by ast_dsp_process. But chan_misdn
	  passes the unfiltered input voice frames instead. To overcome one
	  aspect of the problem, the doubling of DTMF tones when two mISDN
	  channels are directly bridged, someone made an 'optimization',
	  where in that case the DTMF tone passed out-of-band to the peer
	  channel is not translated to an inband tone at the transmit side.
	  This optimization is bad because it does not work in general. For
	  example, analog channels or mISDN channels when bridged through
	  an intermediary local channel will generate DTMF tones from
	  out-of-band information. Also, of course, it must not be done
	  when there is no inband DTMF available. This patch fixes the
	  issue. Now chan_misdn will filter the received inband DTMF signal
	  the same as other channel types. Another change included: No need
	  to build an extra translation path because ast_process_dsp does
	  it if required. Patches: misdn-dtmf.patch JIRA ABE-2080

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If the peer record is from realtime, it
	  could be set to 0, due to MySQL not representing NULL well in
	  integer columns. NULL means the value is not specified for the
	  column, which normally means the driver uses whatever is the
	  default value. However, on MySQL, placing a NULL in either a
	  float or integer column results in a retrieval of the 0 value.
	  Hence, users get an errant error on load. This patch suppresses
	  that error and makes the value as if it was not there. Note that
	  this cannot be done in the realtime driver, because the lack of
	  difference between NULL and 0 can only be intepreted correctly by
	  the driver itself. If we did it in the realtime driver, then it
	  would be effectively impossible to set any realtime field to 0,
	  because it would act as if the field were unspecified and
	  possibly take on a different value. (closes issue #16683)

	  max_len parameter may be -1 in order to limit the size of the
	  ast_str to its current allocated size. The problem was that the
	  max_len parameter in all cases was a size_t, which is unsigned.
	  Thus a -1 was interpreted as UINT_MAX instead of -1. Changing the
	  max_len parameter to be ssize_t fixed this issue. 2. Once issue 1
	  was fixed, there was an off-by-one error in the case where we
	  attempted to write a string larger than the current allotted size
	  to a string when -1 was passed as the max_len parameter. When
	  trying to write more than the allotted size, the ast_str's
	  __AST_STR_USED was set to 1 higher than it should have been.
	  Thanks to Tilghman for quickly spotting the offending line of

	* channels/chan_sip.c: fixes areas where port should be removed

	  converted duplicate uri parsing code to use the parse_uri
	  function. There were two instances where this conversion did not
	  mimic previous behavior exactly because the port was not being
	  parsed off the end of the domain. In order to do this, a dummy
	  pointer argument needs to be passed into parse_uri so it will
	  know it must parse out the port from the domain. If a port output
	  paramenter is not present, the domain is returned with the port
	  still attached.

	  (removed), channels/sip/config_parser.c, tests/test_sched.c:
	  Various updates to the unit test API. 1) It occurred to me that
	  the difference in usage between the error ast_str and the
	  ast_test_update_status() usage has turned out to be a bit
	  ambiguous in practice. In a lot of cases, the same message was
	  being sent to both. In other cases, it was only sent to one or
	  the other. My opinion now is that in every case, I think it makes
	  sense to do both; we should output it to the CLI as well as save
	  it off for logging purposes. This change results in most of the
	  changes in this diff, since it required changes to all existing
	  unit tests. It also allowed for some simplifications of unit test
	  API implementation code. 2) Update ast_test_status_update() to
	  include the file, function, and line number for the code
	  providing the update. 3) There are some formatting tweaks here
	  and there. Hopefully they aren't too distracting for code review
	  purposes. Reviewboard's diff viewer seems to do a pretty good job
	  of pointing out when something is a whitespace change. 4) I moved
	  the md5_test and sha1_test into the test_utils module. It seemed
	  like a better approach since these tests are so tiny. 5) I
	  changed the number of nodes used in heap_test_2 from 1 million to
	  100 thousand. The only reason for this was to reduce the time it
	  took for this test to run. 6) Remove an unused function prototype
	  that was at the bottom of utils.h. 7) Simplify test_insert()
	  using the LIST_INSERT_SORTALPHA() macro. The one minor difference
	  in behavior is that it no longer checks for a test registered
	  with the same name. 8) Expand the code in test_alloc() to provide
	  specific error messages for each failure case, to clearly inform
	  developers if they forget to set the name, summary, description,
	  etc. 9) Tweak the output of the "test show registered" CLI
	  command. I swapped the name and category to have the category
	  first. It seemed more natural since that is the sort key. 10)
	  Don't output the status ast_str in the "test show results" CLI
	  command. This is going to tend to be pretty verbose, so just
	  leave that for the detailed test logs (test generate results).

	* channels/chan_sip.c, channels/sip/include/config_parser.h
	  (added), channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c (added), channels/sip
	  (added), channels/Makefile, channels/sip/config_parser.c (added),
	  channels/sip/include (added), channels/sip/include/sip.h (added),
	  channels/sip/include/sip_utils.h (added),
	  channels/sip/include/reqresp_parser.h (added): -----Changes -----
	  New files - channels/sip/sip.h – A new header for shared #define,
	  enum, and struct definitions. - channels/sip/include/sip_utils.h
	  – sip util functions shared among the all the sip APIs -
	  channels/sip/include/config_parser.h – sip config-parser API -
	  channels/sip/config_parser.c – Contains sip.conf parsing helper
	  functions with unit tests. -
	  channels/sip/include/reqresp_parser.h – sip request response
	  parser API - channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c – Contains sip request
	  and response parsing helper functions with unit tests. New Unit
	  Tests - sip_parse_uri_test - sip_parse_host_test -
	  sip_parse_register_line_test Code Refactoring - All reusable
	  #define, enum, and struct definitions were moved out of
	  chan_sip.c into sip.h. During this process formatting changes
	  were made to comments in both sip.h and chan_sip.c in order to
	  better adhere to the coding guidelines. - The beginnings of three
	  new sip APIs, sip-utils.h, config-parser.h, reqresp-parser.h
	  using existing chan_sip.c functions. - parse_uri() and
	  get_calleridname() were moved from chan_sip.c to request-parser.c
	  along with unit tests for both functions. - sip_parse_host() and
	  sip_parse_register_line() were moved from chan_sip.c to
	  config-parser.c along with unit tests for both functions. Changes
	  to parse_uri() -removal of the options parameter. It was never
	  used and did not behave correctly. -additional check for
	  [?header] field. When this field was present, the transport type
	  was not being set correctly. ----- Overview ----- This patch is
	  introduced with the hope that unit tests for all our sip parsing
	  functions will be written soon. chan_sip is a huge file, and with
	  the addition of each unit test chan_sip is going to grow larger
	  and harder to maintain. I'm proposing we begin refactoring
	  chan_sip, starting with the parsing functions. With each parsing
	  function we move into a separate helper file, a unit test should
	  accompany it. I've attempted to lay down the ground work for this
	  change by creating two new parser helper files (config-parser.c
	  and reqresp-parser.c) and moving all shared structs, enums, and
	  defines from chan_sip.c into a shared sip.h file. We can't verify
	  everything in Asterisk using unit tests, but string parsing is
	  one area where unit tests make the most sense. By beginning to
	  restructure the code in this way, chan_sip not only becomes less
	  bloated, but Asterisk as a whole will become more stable. Review:

	  Unfortunately, that is not a suitable approach. It's not possible
	  to get the value set on the channel soon enough using that
	  method. So, go back to the simple channel variable method.

	* main/test.c: modify 'test show registered' cli output format In
	  order to improve readability, the output from 'test show
	  registered' has been modified to truncate fields to fit within
	  the format output if they are over a certain length.

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, channels/chan_sip.c, tests/test_utils.c
	  (added), main/test.c, main/utils.c: RFC compliant uri and
	  display-name encode/decode 1. URI Encoding This patch changes
	  ast_uri_encode()'s behavior when doreserved is enabled.
	  Previously when doreserved was enabled only a small set of
	  reserved characters were encoded. This set was comprised
	  primarily of the reserved characters defined in RFC3261 section
	  25.1, but contained other characters as well. Rather than only
	  escaping the reserved set, doreserved now escapes all characters
	  not within the unreserved set as defined by RFC 3261 and RFC
	  2396. Also, the 'doreserved' variable has been renamed to
	  'do_special_char' in attempts to avoid confusion. When doreserve
	  is not enabled, the previous logic of only encoding the
	  characters <= 0X1F and > 0X7f remains, except for the '%'
	  character, which must always be encoded as it signifies a HEX
	  escaped character during the decode process. 2. URI Decoding:
	  Break up URI before decode. In chan_sip.c ast_uri_decode is
	  called on the entire URI instead of it's individual parts after
	  it is parsed. This is not good as ast_uri_decode can introduce
	  special characters back into the URI which can mess up parsing.
	  This patch resolves this by not decoding a URI until parsing is
	  completely done. There are many instances where we check to see
	  if pedantic checking is enabled before we decode a URI. In these
	  cases a new macro, SIP_PEDANTIC_DECODE, is used on the individual
	  parsed segments of the URI rather than constantly putting if
	  (pedantic) { decode() } checks everywhere in the code. In the
	  areas where ast_uri_decode is not dependent upon pedantic
	  checking this macro is not used, but decoding is still moved to
	  each individual part of the URI. The only behavior that should
	  change from this patch is the time at which decoding occurs.
	  Since I had to look over every place URI parsing occurs to create
	  this patch, I found several places where we use duplicate code
	  for parsing. To consolidate the code, those areas have updated to
	  use the parse_uri() function where possible. 3. SIP display-name
	  decoding according to RFC3261 section 25. To properly decode the
	  display-name portion of a FROM header, chan_sip's
	  get_calleridname() function required a complete re-write. More
	  information about this change can be found in the comments at the
	  beginning of this function. 4. Unit Tests. Unit tests for
	  ast_uri_encode, ast_uri_decode, and get_calleridname() have been
	  written. This involved the addition of the test_utils.c file for
	  testing the utils api. (closes issue #16299) Reported by: wdoekes

	  bison and flex are detected by the configure script. Changed
	  after discussion on the -dev list about possible unnecessary

	  This should additionally ensure that nobody need learn about

	* main/pbx.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h: Add the TESTTIME() dialplan

	  whether a dialplan correctly branches as was intended. This was
	  developed after recent questions on the -users list on how to
	  test their holiday dialplan logic. (closes issue #16464) Reported

	  asterisk.conf's 'transmit_silence' option existed before this

	* include/asterisk/audiohook.h, main/audiohook.c: fixes
	  AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT regression During the process of removing an
	  audiohook from one channel and attaching it to another the
	  audiohook's status is updated to DONE and then back to whatever
	  it was previously. Typically updating the status after setting it
	  to DONE is not a good idea because DONE can trigger unrecoverable
	  audiohook destruction events... because of this a conditional
	  check was added to audiohook_update_status to explicitly prevent
	  the audiohook from ever changing after being set to DONE. It was
	  this check that prevented audiohook inherit from work properly
	  though. Now ast_audiohook_move_by_source is treated as a special
	  exception, as the audiohook must be returned to its previous
	  status after attaching it to the new channel. This is only a safe
	  operation because the audiohook's lock is held the entire time,
	  otherwise this could cause trouble. (closes issue #16522)

	  During a module reload if multiple extension configs are present,
	  such as both extensions.conf and extensions.ael, watchers for one
	  config's hints will be lost during the merging of the other
	  config. This happens because hint watchers are only preserved for
	  the current config being merged. The old context list is
	  destroyed after the merging takes place, meaning any watchers
	  that were not perserved will be removed. Now all hints are
	  preserved during merging regardless of what config file is being
	  merged. These hints are only restored if they are present within

	  | 16 lines Add a flag to disable the Background behavior, for AGI
	  users. This is in a section of code that relates to two other
	  issues, namely issue #14011 and issue #14940), one of which was
	  the behavior of Background when called with a context argument
	  that matched the current context. This fix broke FreePBX,
	  however, in a post-Dial situation. Needless to say, this is an
	  extremely difficult collision of several different issues. While
	  the use of an exception flag is ugly, fixing all of the issues
	  linked is rather difficult (although if someone would like to

	* CHANGES: Update CHANGES to reflect new QUEUE_MEMBER option,
	  "ready"

	* apps/app_queue.c: QUEUE_MEMBER(..., ready) counts only ready
	  agents, not free agents wrapping up The QUEUE_MEMBER dialplan
	  function can return total members, logged-in members and "free"
	  members count. A member is counted as "free" immediately after
	  his call ends, even though its wrap-up time, if specified in
	  queues.conf, has not yet expired, and the queue will not actually
	  route a call to it. This Patch introduces a new "ready" option
	  that only counts free agents no longer in the wrap up time
	  period. (closes issue #16240) Reported by: kkm Patches:

	  API The Unit Test Framework is a new API that manages
	  registration and execution of unit tests in Asterisk with the
	  purpose of verifying the operation of C functions. The Framework
	  consists of a single test manager accompanied by a list of
	  registered test functions defined within the code. A test is
	  defined, registered, and unregistered from the framework using a
	  set of macros which allow the test code to only be compiled
	  within asterisk when the TEST_FRAMEWORK flag is enabled in
	  menuselect. This allows the test code to exist in the same file
	  as the C functions it intends to verify. Registered tests may be
	  viewed and executed via a set of new CLI commands. CLI commands
	  are also present for generating and exporting test results into
	  xml and txt formats. For more information and use cases please
	  refer to the documentation provided at the beginning of the
	  test.h file. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/447/

	  set a module load priority on them to ensure that they get loaded
	  first when autoloading. This fix applies to trunk, 1.6.1, and

	* main/udptl.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/udptl.h:
	  Another round of UDPTL stack fixes/improvements: 1) Allow users
	  of UDPTL stack to associate a character-string tag with a UDPTL
	  session, so that log/error/debug messages generated by the UDPTL
	  stack can be 'connected' to the endpoint that caused them to be
	  generated. 2) Improve comments (and process) of calculating the
	  far end's maximum IFP size when redundancy mode is in use for
	  error correction. 3) When an IFP larger than the calculated 'far
	  max IFP' size is presented for writing, truncate it rather than
	  putting in the buffer and allowing the buffer to overflow; this
	  will cause the ends to retrain to a lower bit rate that produces
	  IFPs of an appropriate size if possible, and if not possible, the
	  FAX transfer will fail completely. In these cases, it is due to
	  the one endpoint supplying a T38FaxMaxDatagram value that is
	  improperly calculated and is too low to be of use; we have
	  configuration options available to override this behavior. 4)
	  Eliminate use of T38FaxMaxDatagram value in udptl.conf; it is no
	  longer needed.

	* main/features.c: Fix erroneous hangup extension execution
	  ast_spawn_extension behaves differently from 1.4 in that hangups
	  and extensions that do not exist do not return an error, whereas
	  in 1.6 it does. This is now taken into account so that the
	  AST_FLAG_BRIDGE_HANGUP_RUN flag gets set properly. (closes issue
	  #16106) Reported by: ajohnson Tested by: ajohnson

	* channels/sig_pri.h, channels/chan_dahdi.c, channels/sig_pri.c:
	  Fix problem on digital channels due to digital flag not getting
	  set Changed areas in sig_pri to set the digital flag using a
	  callback that will also set the corresponding flag in chan_dahdi.
	  Modified dahdi_request slightly so that if a bearer is marked as
	  digital, that information is available when creating the new
	  channel. (closes issue #16151) Reported by: alecdavis Patch based

	* include/asterisk/app.h, funcs/func_strings.c, CHANGES: Add
	  REPLACE & PASSTHRU functions, overhaul of func_strings, fix API
	  docs for the ast_get_encoded_* functions. * Add REPLACE function,
	  which searches a given variable for a set of characters and
	  replaces each with a given character. * Add PASSTHRU function,
	  which passes a literal string back, like a NoOp for functions.
	  Intent is to be able to specify a literal string to another
	  function that takes a variable name as an argument. * Let the
	  array manipulation functions work with dialplan functions, in
	  addition to variables. This allows the array manipulation
	  functions to modify ASTDB and ODBC backends, assuming the
	  func_odbc configuration has both read and write functions.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Change fax
	  detection in chan_sip so it behaves as one would expect.
	  Internally the way T.38 is negotiated has changed and the option
	  no longer reflects a behavior that is valid. It will now look for
	  a CNG tone on received calls and if present send the call to the
	  'fax' extension. It is then up to the application or channel to
	  request the switch over to T.38.

	* channels/sig_pri.h, channels/chan_dahdi.c, UPGRADE.txt,
	  channels/sig_pri.c: DAHDI ISDN channel names will not allow
	  device state to work. (Interim solution.) Since ISDN works like
	  SIP and not analog ports in regard to devices, the device state
	  based on the ISDN channel number could not work. This has not
	  been an issue until the advent of PTMP NT mode. Previously, ISDN
	  lines were used as trunks and did not have to keep track of
	  specific devices. As an interim solution until device states are
	  properly implemented, the channel name is being changed to the
	  following format to use the generic device state support:
	  DAHDI/i<span>/<number>[:<subaddress>]-<sequence-number> Dialplan
	  hints would thus be: exten => xxx,hint,DAHDI/i2/5551212 This will
	  work with the following restrictions: * The number of
	  devices/phones cannot exceed the number of B channels. (i.e., BRI
	  has 2) * Each device/phone can only have one number. No shared
	  MSN's. * The phones/devices probably should not use
	  subaddressing.

	* main/tcptls.c, channels/chan_sip.c, apps/app_externalivr.c,
	  include/asterisk/tcptls.h: SIP TCP/TLS: move client connection
	  setup/write into tcp helper thread, various related
	  locking/memory fixes. What this patch fixes 1.Moves sip TCP/TLS
	  connection setup into the TCP helper thread: Connection setup
	  takes awhile and before this it was being done while holding the
	  monitor lock. 2.Moves TCP/TLS writing to the TCP helper thread:
	  Through the use of a packet queue and an alert pipe, the TCP
	  helper thread can now be woken up to write data as well as read
	  data. 3.Locking error: sip_xmit returned an XMIT_ERROR without
	  giving up the tcptls_session lock. This lock has been completely
	  removed from sip_xmit and placed in the new sip_tcptls_write()
	  function. 4.Memory leak: When creating a tcptls_client the
	  tls_cfg was alloced but never freed unless the tcptls_session
	  failed to start. Now the session_args for a sip client are an ao2
	  object which frees the tls_cfg on destruction. 5.Pointer to stack
	  variable: During sip_prepare_socket the creation of a client's
	  ast_tcptls_session_args was done on the stack and stored as a
	  pointer in the newly created tcptls_session. Depending on the
	  events that followed, there was a slight possibility that pointer
	  could have been accessed after the stack returned. Given the new
	  changes, it is always accessed after the stack returns which is
	  why I found it. Notable code changes 1.I broke tcptls.c's
	  ast_tcptls_client_start() function into two functions. One for
	  creating and allocating the new tcptls_session, and a separate
	  one for starting and handling the new connection. This allowed me
	  to create the tcptls_session, launch the helper thread, and then
	  establish the connection within the helper thread. 2.Writes to a
	  tcptls_session are now done within the helper thread. This is
	  done by using an alert pipe to wake up the thread if new data
	  needs to be sent. The thread's sip_threadinfo object contains the
	  alert pipe as well as the packet queue. 3.Since the threadinfo
	  object contains the alert pipe, it must now be accessed outside
	  of the helper thread for every write (queuing of a packet). For
	  easy lookup, I moved the threadinfo objects from a linked list to
	  an ao2_container. (closes issue #13136) Reported by: pabelanger

	  with no destination call number It is possible for the PBX thread
	  to queue up signaling frames before a destination call number is
	  received. This can result in signaling frames being sent out with
	  no destination call number. Since recent versions of Asterisk
	  require accurate destination callnumbers for all Full Frames,
	  this can cause a VNAK loop to occur. To resolve this no signaling
	  frames are sent until a destination callnumber is received, and
	  destination call numbers are now only required for iax_pvt
	  matching when the frame is an ACK. Review:

	  'ao2_flags' arguments to the ast_channel_iterator constructor

	  | 13 lines Fix stale caller id data from being reported in AMI
	  NewChannel event The problem here is that chan_dahdi is designed
	  in such a way to set certain values in the dahdi_pvt only once.
	  One of those such values is the configured caller id data in
	  chan_dahdi.conf. For PRI, the configured caller id data could be
	  overwritten during a call. Instead of saving the data and
	  restoring, it was decided that for all non-analog channels it was
	  simply best to not set the configured caller id in the first
	  place and also clear it at the end of the call. (closes issue
	  #15883) Reported by: jsmith ........

	  isolating frames before returning them. This patch is related to
	  a number of issues on the bug tracker that show crashes related
	  to freeing frames that came from a filestream. A number of fixes
	  have been made over time while trying to figure out these
	  problems, but there re still people seeing the crash. (Note that
	  some of these bug reports include information about other
	  problems. I am specifically addressing the filestream frame crash
	  here.) I'm still not clear on what the exact problem is. However,
	  what is _very_ clear is that we have seen quite a few problems
	  over time related to unexpected behavior when we try to use
	  embedded frames as an optimization. In some cases, this
	  optimization doesn't really provide much due to improvements made
	  in other areas. In this case, the patch modifies filestream
	  handling such that the embedded frame will not be returned.
	  ast_frisolate() is used to ensure that we end up with a
	  completely mallocd frame. In reality, though, we will not
	  actually have to malloc every time. For filestreams, the frame
	  will almost always be allocated and freed in the same thread.
	  That means that the thread local frame cache will be used. So,
	  going this route doesn't hurt. With this patch in place, some
	  people have reported success in not seeing the crash anymore.

	  for the entire function. At the end of the function both channels

	* CHANGES: Updates CHANGES to reflect the new externtcpport and
	  externtlsport sip options

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: contact header port
	  ignored transport when using externip This patch adds support for
	  TCP/TLS in the Contact header when using NAT, specifically
	  externip or externhost. The original issue was that Asterisk sent
	  5060 as the port in the contact header whether TLS was used or
	  not. Additionally, this patch adds 2 config options to sip.conf,
	  specifically externtcpport and externtlsport. This allows a user
	  to specify different external ports for TCP and TLS other than
	  those used internally, this is especially useful in in a PAT/port
	  redirection setup. Thanks to ebroad for reporting the issue and
	  providing the patch! (closes issue #15880) Reported by: ebroad

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c: Fix 222298 (crash during destruction of

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c: Make sure digit events are not reported as
	  "ERROR" dahdievent_to_analogevent used a simple switch statement
	  to convert DAHDI event numbers to "ANALOG_*" event numbers.
	  However "digit" events (DAHDI_EVENT_PULSEDIGIT,
	  DAHDI_EVENT_DTMFDOWN, DAHDI_EVENT_DTMFUP) are accompannied by the
	  digit in the low word of the event number. This fix makes
	  dahdievent_to_analogevent() return the event number as-is for
	  such an event. This is also required to fix #15924 (in addition
	  to r222108).

	  instead of a macro, with a name that fits our naming policy;
	  also, it is now necessary to call ao2_iterator_destroy() on any
	  iterator that has been created. Currently this only releases the
	  reference to the container being iterated, but in the future this
	  could also release other resources used by the iterator, if the

	* main/udptl.c, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/udptl.conf.sample,
	  UPGRADE.txt, configs/sip.conf.sample: Allow non-compliant T.38
	  endpoints to be supportable via configuration option. Many T.38
	  endpoints incorrectly send the maximum IFP frame size they can
	  accept as the T38FaxMaxDatagram value in their SDP, when in fact
	  this value is supposed to be the maximum UDPTL payload size
	  (datagram size) they can accept. If the value they supply is
	  small enough (a commonly supplied value is '72'), T.38 UDPTL
	  transmissions will likely fail completely because the UDPTL
	  packets will not have enough room for a primary IFP frame and the
	  redundancy used for error correction. If this occurs, the
	  Asterisk UDPTL stack will emit log messages warning that data
	  loss may occur, and that the value may need to be overridden.
	  This patch extends the 't38pt_udptl' configuration option in
	  sip.conf to allow the administrator to override the value
	  supplied by the remote endpoint and supply a value that allows
	  T.38 FAX transmissions to be successful with that endpoint. In
	  addition, in any SIP call where the override takes effect, a
	  debug message will be printed to that effect. This patch also
	  removes the T38FaxMaxDatagram configuration option from
	  udptl.conf.sample, since it has not actually had any effect for a
	  number of releases. In addition, this patch cleans up the T.38
	  documentation in sip.conf.sample (which incorrectly documented
	  that T.38 support was passthrough only). (issue #15586) Reported

	  where it should have been all along. This patch removes the
	  ability to configure it in udptl.conf, but issues a warning if
	  the user tries to do, telling them to look at sip.conf.sample for
	  how to configure it now. For any SIP peers that are T.38 enabled
	  in sip.conf, there is already a default for FEC error correction
	  even if the user does not specify any mode, so this change will
	  not turn off error correction by default, it will have the same
	  default value that has been in the udptl.conf sample file.

	  server which sends a re-invite back toAsterisk--not to negotiate
	  to send media directly to the ITSP, but to indicatethat it's
	  changing the stream it's sending to Asterisk. The app
	  servergenerates a new SSRC, sequence numbers, timestamps, and
	  sets the marker bit on the new stream. Asterisk passes through
	  the teimstamp of the new stream, butdoes not reset the SSRC,
	  sequence numbers, or set the marker bit. When the timestamp on
	  the new stream is older than the timestamp on the originalstream,
	  the ITSP (which doesn't know there has been any change) discards
	  the newframes because it thinks they are too old. This patch
	  addresses this by changing the SSRC on a stream update unless

	  Token security patch inadvertently broke the use of encryption
	  due to the reorganization of code in the socket_process()

	  first be decrypted before the information elements can be parsed.
	  The security release mistakenly moved IE parsing before
	  decryption in order to process the new Call Token IE. To resolve
	  this, decryption of full frames is once again done before looking
	  into the frame. This involves searching for an existing callno,
	  checking the pvt to see if encryption is turned on, and
	  decrypting the packet before the internal fields of the full
	  frame are accessed. (closes issue #15834) Reported by: karesmakro

	  lines Make apps send PROGRESS control frame for early media and
	  fix too early media issue in SIP The issue at hand is that some
	  legacy (dying) PBX systems send empty media frames on PRI links
	  *before* any call progress. The SIP channel receives these frames
	  and by default signals 183 Session progress and starts sending
	  media. This will cause phones to play silence and ignore the
	  later 180 ringing message. A bad user experience. The fix is
	  twofold: - We discovered that asterisk apps that support early
	  media ("noanswer") did not send any PROGRESS frame to indicate
	  early media. Fixed. - We introduce a setting in chan_sip so that
	  users can disable any relay of media frames before the outbound
	  channel actually indicates any sort of call progress. In 1.4,
	  1.6.0 and 1.6.1, this will be disabled for backward
	  compatibility. In later versions of Asterisk, this will be
	  enabled. We don't assume that it will change your Asterisk phone
	  experience - only for the better. We encourage third-party
	  application developers to make sure that if they have
	  applications that wants to send early media, add a PROGRESS
	  control frame transmission to make sure that all channel drivers
	  actually will start sending early media. This has not been the
	  default in Asterisk previous to this patch, so if you got
	  inspiration from our code, you need to update accordingly. Sorry
	  for the trouble and thanks for your support. This code has been
	  running for a few months in a large scale installation (over 250
	  servers with PRI and/or BRI links to old PBX systems). That's no
	  proof that this is an excellent patch, but, well, it's tested :-)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Do not treat every SIP peer as if they were
	  configured with insecure=port. There was a problem in the
	  function responsible for doing peer matching by IP address and
	  port number such that during the second pass for checking for a
	  peer configured with insecure=port, it would end up treating
	  every peer as if it had been configured that way. These changes
	  fix the logic in the peer IP and port comparison callback to
	  handle insecure=port checking properly. This problem was
	  introduced when SIP peers were converted to astobj2. Many thanks
	  to dvossel for noticing this while working on another peer
	  matching issue.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: port string to int conversion using sscanf
	  There are several instances where a port is parsed from a uri or

	  platforms to REMOVE certain API calls that are not in the POSIX
	  specification, such as vasprintf(3). Thus, defining it while
	  depending upon vasprintf (and other extensions to the POSIX

	  | 8 lines Modify comment to be a bit more accurate. We have kept
	  this comment around long enough, that it's pretty clear that
	  we're keeping the code, because changing the code would require a
	  pretty fundamental architectural shift. We've also taken
	  criticism in some quarters, because it was believed that it was
	  referring to the code being nasty. No, the code isn't nasty, just
	  the operation itself is rather odd. Fixed for eternity (probably
	  not). ........

	* Makefile, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  makeopts.in: Ensure that CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS provided to
	  configure script are preserved. Cross-compilation environments
	  want to provide 'defaults' for compiler and linker options, and
	  frequently do this by specifying CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in the
	  environment or as command-line arguments to the configure script.
	  This patch modifies the configure script and Makefile to preserve
	  these settings and ensure they are used in the build process.

	  | 19 lines ast_write() ignores ast_audiohook_write() results In
	  ast_write(), if a channel has a list of audiohooks, those lists
	  are written to and the resulting frame is what ast_write() should
	  continue with. The problem was the returned audiohook frame was
	  not being handled at all, and the original frame passed into it
	  did not contain the mixed audio, so essentially audio was being
	  lost. One result of this was chan_spy's whisper mode no longer
	  worked. To complicate the issue, frames passed into ast_write may
	  either be a single frame, or a list of frames. So, as the list of
	  frames is processed in the audiohook_write, the returned frames
	  had to be added to a new list. (closes issue #15660) Reported by:

	  searching by uniqueid was not actually implemented. This patch
	  fixes that problem. The ast_channel_get_full() function now makes
	  a second search attempt by uniqueid if the parameter was a name.
	  The channel comparison function also now knows how to compare by
	  unqieueid. Finally, a bug was fixed in passing where OBJ_POINTER
	  was being passed in some scenarios where it should not have been.

	* main/udptl.c: Workaround broken T.38 endpoints that offer tiny

	  UDPRedundancy as the error correction mode, we'll end up
	  calculating a tiny maximum IFP size, so small as to be unusable.
	  This patch sets a lower bound on what we'll consider the remote's
	  maximum IFP size to be, assuming that endpoints that do this
	  really can accept larger packets than they've offered to accept.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample: Add configuration sample code for

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Improve chan_sip's ability to determine what
	  methods should and should not be used in a dialog. The previous
	  effort here was to store what a peer is capable of receiving by
	  parsing REGISTER requests from the peer and keeping that
	  information for as long as the registration was active. The
	  problem with this is that there are a great number of SIP devices
	  which give no indication of the methods allowed in their REGISTER
	  requests, and it is unreasonable to try to guess what the device
	  may or may not support. In addition, some SIP devices have been
	  found to claim support for a specific method, but their handling
	  the method is less than ideal, or they are actually lying. With
	  this patch, we now determine what methods a device supports by
	  parsing the Allow header we receive from them, and we do this
	  with each new dialog. In addition, a configuration option has
	  been added so that an administrator can essentially blacklist
	  certain methods from being used with certain peers if the admin
	  knows that support for a specific method is dodgy or nonexistent.

	  channels/chan_sip.c, apps/app_fax.c, UPGRADE.txt,
	  include/asterisk/udptl.h, include/asterisk/frame.h: Rework of
	  T.38 negotiation and UDPTL API to address interoperability
	  problems Over the past couple of months, a number of issues with
	  Asterisk negotiating (and successfully completing) T.38 sessions
	  with various endpoints have been found. This patch attempts to
	  address many of them, primarily focused around ensuring that the
	  endpoints' MaxDatagram size is honored, and in addition by
	  ensuring that T.38 session parameter negotiation is performed
	  correctly according to the ITU T.38 Recommendation. The major
	  changes here are: 1) T.38 applications in Asterisk (app_fax) only
	  generate/receive IFP packets, they do not ever work with UDPTL
	  packets. As a result of this, they cannot be allowed to generate
	  packets that would overflow the other endpoints' MaxDatagram size
	  after the UDPTL stack adds any error correction information. With
	  this patch, the application is told the maximum *IFP* size it can
	  generate, based on a calculation using the far end MaxDatagram
	  size and the active error correction mode on the T.38 session.
	  The same is true for sending *our* MaxDatagram size to the remote
	  endpoint; it is computed from the value that the application says
	  it can accept (for a single IFP packet) combined with the active
	  error correction mode. 2) All treatment of T.38 session
	  parameters as 'capabilities' in chan_sip has been removed; these
	  parameters are not at all like audio/video stream capabilities.
	  There are strict rules to follow for computing an answer to a
	  T.38 offer, and chan_sip now follows those rules, using the
	  desired parameters from the application (or channel) that wants
	  to accept the T.38 negotiation. 3) chan_sip now stores and
	  forwards ast_control_t38_parameters structures for tracking 'our'
	  and 'their' T.38 session parameters; this greatly simplifies
	  negotiation, especially for pass-through calls. 4) Since T.38
	  negotiation without specifying parameters or receiving the final
	  negotiated parameters is not very worthwhile, the AST_CONTROL_T38
	  control frame has been removed. A note has been added to
	  UPGRADE.txt about this removal, since any out-of-tree
	  applications that use it will no longer function properly until
	  they are upgraded to use AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS. Review:

	  out of dialog. This generalizes the fix for issue 13849. The
	  initial fix corrected the problem that Asterisk would reply with
	  a 491 if a reinvite were received from an endpoint and we had not
	  yet received an ACK from that endpoint for the initial INVITE it
	  had sent us. This expansion also allows Asterisk to appropriately
	  handle an INVITE with authorization credentials if Asterisk had
	  not received an ACK from the previous transaction in which
	  Asterisk had responded to an unauthorized INVITE with a 407.

	  2009) | 33 lines Answer video SDP offers properly when
	  videosupport is not enabled. Copied from Review board: In issue
	  12434, the reporter describes a situation in which audio and
	  video is offered on the call, but because videosupport is
	  disabled in sip.conf, Asterisk gives no response at all to the
	  video offer. According to RFC 3264, all media offers should have
	  a corresponding answer. For offers we do not intend to actually
	  reply to with meaningful values, we should still reply with the
	  port for the media stream set to 0. In this patch, we take note
	  of what types of media have been offered and save the information
	  on the sip_pvt. The SDP in the response will take into account
	  whether media was offered. If we are not otherwise going to
	  answer a media offer, we will insert an appropriate m= line with
	  the port set to 0. It is important to note that this patch is
	  pretty much a bandage being applied to a broken bone. The patch
	  *only* helps for situations where video is offered but
	  videosupport is disabled and when udptl_pt is disabled but T.38
	  is offered. Asterisk is not guaranteed to respond to every media
	  offer. Notable cases are when multiple streams of the same type
	  are offered. The 2 media stream limit is still present with this
	  patch, too. In trunk and the 1.6.X branches, things will be a bit
	  different since Asterisk also supports text in SDPs as well.

	  MSNs without type-of-number prefix added. For an incoming ISDN
	  call the dialed.number is incorrectly matched against the
	  configured MSNs in misdn.conf. The numbers passed to the dialplan
	  include the configured prefix for the dialed.number_type, whereas
	  the check against the configured MSNs (to decide if the call is
	  accepted at all), is executed without the configured prefix.
	  e.g., dialed.number = 241168020, TON = national, configured
	  national prefix is "0". (This is the TON which is used by ISDN
	  providers in the Netherlands.) In chan_misdn.c:cb_events() in
	  case EVENT_SETUP the call to misdn_cfg_is_msn_valid() uses the
	  unnormalized number 241168020, but 57 lines later the call to
	  read_config() adds the prefix, and the dialed.number is now
	  0241168020, which is then used in the dialplan.
	  misdn_cfg_is_msn_valid() must use the normalized number, too.

	  .......... Fixed chan_misdn crash because mISDNuser library is
	  not thread safe. With Asterisk the mISDNuser library is driven by
	  two threads concurrently: 1.
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c::manager_event_handler() 2.
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c::misdn_lib_isdn_event_catcher() Calls
	  into the library are done concurrently and recursively from
	  isdn_lib.c. Both threads can fiddle with the master/child
	  layer3_proc_t lists. One thread may traverse the list when the
	  other interrupts it and then removes the list element which the
	  first thread was currently handling. This is exactly what caused
	  the crash. About 60 calls were needed to a Gigaset CX475 before
	  it occurred once. This patch adds locking when calling into the
	  mISDNuser library. This also fixes some cb_log calls with wrong
	  port parameter. JIRA ABE-1913 Patches: misdn-locking.patch

	* doc/tex/security-events.tex (added), tests/test_security_events.c

	  res/res_security_log.c (added), tests/test_ami_security_events.sh
	  (added): Add an API for reporting security events, and a security
	  event logging module. This commit introduces the security events
	  API. This API is to be used by Asterisk components to report
	  events that have security implications. A simple example is when
	  a connection is made but fails authentication. These events can
	  be used by external tools manipulate firewall rules or something
	  similar after detecting unusual activity based on security
	  events. Inside of Asterisk, the events go through the ast_event
	  API. This means that they have a binary encoding, and it is easy
	  to write code to subscribe to these events and do something with
	  them. One module is provided that is a subscriber to these events
	  - res_security_log. This module turns security events into a
	  parseable text format and sends them to the "security" logger
	  level. Using logger.conf, these log entries may be sent to a
	  file, or to syslog. One service, AMI, has been fully updated for
	  reporting security events. AMI was chosen as it was a fairly
	  straight forward service to convert. The next target will be
	  chan_sip. That will be more complicated and will be done as its
	  own project as the next phase of security events work. For more
	  information on the security events framework, see the
	  documentation generated from doc/tex/. "make asterisk.pdf"

	  | 31 lines SIP registration auth loop caused by stale nonce If an
	  endpoint sends two registration requests in a very short period
	  of time with the same nonce, both receive 401 responses from
	  Asterisk, each with a different nonce (the second 401 containing
	  the current nonce and the first one being stale). If the endpoint
	  responds to the first 401, it does not match the current nonce so
	  Asterisk sends a third 401 with a newly generated nonce (which
	  updates the current nonce)... Now if the endpoint responds to the
	  second 401, it does not match the current nonce either and
	  Asterisk sends a fourth 401 with a newly generated nonce... This
	  loop goes on and on. There appears to be a simple fix for this.
	  If the nonce from the request does not match our nonce, but is a
	  good response to a previous nonce, instead of sending a 401 with
	  a newly generated nonce, use the current one instead. This breaks
	  the loop as the nonce is not updated until a response is
	  received. Additional logic has been added to make sure no nonce
	  can be responded to twice though. (closes issue #15102) Reported

	  loops to not actually call ast_read() and attempt to process the
	  returned frame unless a frame actually arrived, eliminating
	  hundreds of LOG_DEBUG messages and slightly improving

	  Move OpenSSL initialization to a single place, make library usage
	  thread-safe. While doing some reading about OpenSSL, I noticed a
	  couple of things that needed to be improved with our usage of
	  OpenSSL. 1) We had initialization of the library done in multiple
	  modules. This has now been moved to a core function that gets
	  executed during Asterisk startup. We already link OpenSSL into
	  the core for TCP/TLS functionality, so this was the most logical
	  place to do it. 2) OpenSSL is not thread-safe by default.
	  However, making it thread safe is very easy. We just have to
	  provide a couple of callbacks. One callback returns a thread ID.
	  The other handles locking. For more information, start with the
	  "Is OpenSSL thread-safe?" question on the FAQ page of
	  openssl.org.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove some bogus deadlock avoidance code
	  from local_attended_transfer. First of all, the code was
	  unnecessary. The goal was to lock a channel which was already
	  locked. Second, the assumption of the deadlock avoidance loop was
	  that the sip_pvt was already locked and we were trying to get the
	  channel lock. The problem is that the sip_pvt was unlocked a few
	  lines above. Basically, I'm removing 5 lines of no-op.

	  2009) | 22 lines Fix a problem where chan_sip would ignore "old"
	  but valid responses. chan_sip has had a problem for quite a long
	  time that would manifest when Asterisk would send multiple SIP
	  responses on the same dialog before receiving a response. The
	  problem occurred because chan_sip only kept track of the highest
	  outgoing sequence number used on the dialog. If Asterisk sent two
	  requests out, and a response arrived for the first request sent,
	  then Asterisk would ignore the response. The result was that
	  Asterisk would continue retransmitting the requests and ignoring
	  the responses until the maximum number of retransmissions had
	  been reached. The fix here is to rearrange the code a bit so that
	  instead of simply comparing the sequence number of the response
	  to our latest outgoing sequence number, we walk our list of
	  outstanding packets and determine if there is a match. If there
	  is, we continue. If not, then we ignore the response. In doing
	  this, I found a few completely useless variables that I have now
	  removed. (closes issue #11231) Reported by: flefoll Review:

	* main/channel.c, include/asterisk/channel.h: Allow trunk to once

	* configs/cel_adaptive_odbc.conf.sample: Remove invalid entries in

	  needed semicolon prefixes, but in reality, the adaptive layer is
	  designed to allow arbitrary CDR variables, without needing the
	  use of a userfield to store multiple items. It's therefore not
	  only invalid syntax but also goes against the intent of the
	  adaptive method.

	  phone side), the CPE side does not have enough information to
	  exclusively pick B channels. (There may be other devices on the

	  2009) | 26 lines Fix a situation in which Asterisk would not stop
	  retransmitting 487s. If a CANCEL were received by Asterisk, we
	  would send a 487 in response to the original INVITE and a 200 OK
	  for the CANCEL. If there were a network hiccup which caused the
	  200 OK and the 487 to be lost, then the UA communicating with
	  Asterisk may try to retransmit its CANCEL. Asterisk's response to
	  this used to be to try sending another 487 to the canceled INVITE
	  and another 200 OK to the CANCEL. The problem here is that the
	  originally-sent 487 was sent "reliably" meaning that it will be
	  retransmitted until it is received properly. So when we receive
	  the second CANCEL it is likely that the first batch of 487s we
	  sent is still going strong and reaches the UA. The result was
	  that the second set of 487s would be retransmitted constantly
	  until the maximum number of retries had been reached. The fix for
	  this is that if we receive a second CANCEL for an INVITE, then we
	  cancel the retransmission of the first set of 487s and start a
	  second set. This causes the dialog to be terminated reasonably.

	  reloads of non files mode MoH classes. For Music on Hold classes
	  that are not files mode, meaning that we are executing an

	  thread also makes use of the MoH class object. In the MoH class
	  destructor, we used pthread_cancel() to ask the thread to exit.
	  Unfortunately, the code did not wait to ensure that the thread
	  actually went away. What needed to be done is a pthread_join() to
	  ensure that the thread fully cleans up before we proceed. By
	  adding this one line, we resolve two significant problems: 1)
	  Since the thread was never joined, it never fully goes away. So,
	  on every reload of non-files mode MoH, an unused thread was
	  sticking around. 2) There was a race condition here where the
	  application monitoring thread could still try to access the MoH
	  class, even though the thread executing the MoH reload has
	  already destroyed it. (issue #15109) Reported by: jvandal (issue

	  not need digit detection nor FAX tone detection while they are

	  detection, this consumes extra CPU cycles that could be better
	  spent on the actual application. This patch allows applications
	  to query and control the state of digit and tone detection on a
	  channel, and modifies app_fax to disable them while the FAX
	  operations are occurring (and re-enable digit detection
	  afterwards).

	* configure, configure.ac: Explicitly test for 'static weakref'

	* channels/chan_sip.c: SIP transport type issues What this patch
	  addresses: 1. ast_sip_ouraddrfor() by default binds to the UDP
	  address/port reguardless if the sip->pvt is of type UDP or not.
	  Now when no remapping is required, ast_sip_ouraddrfor() checks
	  the sip_pvt's transport type, attempting to set the address and
	  port to the correct TCP/TLS bindings if necessary. 2. It is not
	  necessary to send the port number in the Contact header unless
	  the port is non-standard for the transport type. This patch fixes
	  this and removes the todo note. 3. In sip_alloc(), the default
	  dialog built always uses transport type UDP. Now sip_alloc()
	  looks at the sip_request (if present) and determines what
	  transport type to use by default. 4. When changing the transport
	  type of a sip_socket, the file descriptor must be set to -1 and
	  in some cases the tcptls_session's ref count must be decremented
	  and set to NULL. I've encountered several issues associated with
	  this process and have created a function, set_socket_transport(),
	  to handle the setting of the socket type. (closes issue #13865)

	  Voicemail can only use one storage module at the moment. Because
	  it's unclear that selecting one of the storage modules in
	  menuselect will disable filesystem storage we now have a
	  FILE_STORAGE option that conflicts with the other modules.

	* main/manager.c: Don't claim a char * is a mansession object.
	  Since there was only 1 bucket, and no hash function was
	  specified, the code actually worked perfectly fine. However, in
	  theory, this was invalid use of the OBJ_POINTER flag, so remove
	  it so the code provides a better usage example.

	* configure, autoconf/ast_gcc_attribute.m4: Ensure that
	  configure-script testing for compiler attributes actually works.
	  The configure script tests for compiler attributes didn't
	  actually enable enough warnings or provide a proper test harness
	  to determine whether the compiler supports the attribute in
	  question or not; this caused gcc 4.1 to report that it supports
	  'weakref', but it doesn't actually support it in the way that is
	  needed for our optional API mechanism. The new configure script
	  test will properly distinguish between full support and partial
	  support for this attribute, among others.

	* CHANGES: Document the new automatic 'ignoresdpversion' behavior.
	  Asterisk will now automatically ignore incorrect incoming SDP
	  version numbers when necessary to complete a T.38 re-INVITE
	  operation.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Accept T.38 re-INVITE responses with invalid
	  SDP versions. This commit changes the 'incoming SDP version'
	  check logic a bit more; when 'ignoresdpversion' is *not* set for
	  a peer, if we initiate a re-INVITE to switch to T.38, we'll
	  always accept the peer's SDP response, even if they don't
	  properly increment the SDP version number as they should. If this
	  situation occurs, a warning message will be generated suggesting
	  that the peer's configuration be changed to include the
	  'ignoresdpversion' configuration option (although ideally they'd
	  fix their SIP implementation to be RFC compliant). AST-221

	  in include/asterisk/app.h, which many developers followed (thanks
	  for reading the documentation!). In addition, add some basic
	  usage examples of the 'pahole' and 'pglobal' tools to the coding

	  channels/chan_iax2.c: Convert a number of global module variables
	  to 'static'. These modules all contained variables that are
	  module-global but not system-global, but were not marked
	  'static'.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Some minor structure size improvements in
	  sip_pvt and sip_peer. Using the 'pahole' tool, it is now quite
	  easy to see where structure fields could be organized differently
	  to keep the compiler from having to add padding to satisfy
	  alignment requirements. These changes reduced the sizes of
	  sip_pvt and sip_peer by a few bytes each (on 64-bit platforms),
	  and also fixed a spelling error in a field name.

	  'optional API' support. This patch provides a new implementation
	  of the optional API support defined in asterisk/optional_api.h;
	  this new version provides solves compatibility issues with the
	  use of linker version scripts for suppressing global symbols. In
	  addition, there is now a functional (and tested!) implementation
	  for Mac OS/X, so module writers no longer need to use special
	  tests before calling optional API functions. All future
	  implementations must provide these same semantics, so that module
	  writers can rely on them.

	  2009) | 40 lines Safely handle AMI connections/reload requests
	  that occur during startup. During asterisk startup, a lock on the
	  list of modules is obtained by the primary thread while each
	  module is initialized. Issue 13778 pointed out a problem with
	  this approach, however. Because the AMI is loaded before other
	  modules, it is possible for a module reload to be issued by a
	  connected client (via Action: Command), causing a deadlock. The
	  resolution for 13778 was to move initialization of the manager to
	  happen after the other modules had already been lodaded. While
	  this fixed this particular issue, it caused a problem for users
	  (like FreePBX) who call AMI scripts via an #exec in a
	  configuration file (See issue 15189). The solution I have come up
	  with is to defer any reload requests that come in until after the
	  server is fully booted. When a call comes in to ast_module_reload
	  (from wherever) before we are fully booted, the request is added
	  to a queue of pending requests. Once we are done booting up, we
	  then execute these deferred requests in turn. Note that I have
	  tried to make this a bit more intelligent in that it will not
	  queue up more than 1 request for the same module to be reloaded,
	  and if a general reload request comes in ('module reload') the
	  queue is flushed and we only issue a single deferred reload for
	  the entire system. As for how this will impact existing
	  installations - Before 13778, a reload issued before module
	  initialization was completed would result in a deadlock. After
	  13778, you simply couldn't connect to the manager during startup
	  (which causes problems with #exec-that-calls-AMI configuration
	  files). I believe this is a good general purpose solution that
	  won't negatively impact existing installations. (closes issue

	* res/res_timing_pthread.c: Resolve issues with choppy sound when
	  using res_timing_pthread. The situation that caused this problem
	  was when continuous mode was being turned on and off while a rate
	  was set for a timing interface. A very easy way to replicate this
	  bug was to do a Playback() from behind a Local channel. In this
	  scenario, a rate gets set on the channel for doing file playback.
	  At the same time, continuous mode gets turned on and off about
	  every 20 ms as frames get queued on to the PBX side channel from
	  the other side of the Local channel. Essentially, this module
	  treated continuous mode and a set rate as mutually exclusive
	  states for the timer to be in. When I dug deep enough, I observed
	  the following pattern: 1) Set timer to tick every 20 ms. 2) Wait
	  almost 20 ms ... 3) Continuous mode gets turned on for a queued
	  up frame 4) Continuous mode gets turned off 5) The timer goes
	  back to its tick per 20 ms. state but starts counting at 0 ms. 6)
	  Goto step 2. Sometimes, res_timing_pthread would make it 20 ms
	  and produce a timer tick, but not most of the time. This is what
	  produced the choppy sound (or sometimes no sound at all). Now,
	  the module treats continuous mode and a set rate as completely
	  independent timer modes. They can be enabled and disabled
	  independently of each other and things work as expected. (closes

	* main/utils.c: Ensure that accidental calls to
	  ast_string_field_free_memory() on embedded stringfield pools are
	  safe. It is possible for a stringfield manager structure (and
	  pool) structure to be allocated as part of a larger structure
	  allocation (using ast_calloc_with_strinfields()); when this is
	  done, the stringfield pool cannot be separately freed, but users
	  of the tructure may not be aware (and shouldn't have to be aware)

	  This commit add Calendaring support to Asterisk for iCalendar,
	  CalDAV, and MS Exchange calendars. Exchange support has only been
	  tested on Exchange Server 2k3 and does not support forms-based
	  authentication at this time (patches *very* welcome). Exchange
	  support is also currently missing the ability to return a list of
	  a meting's attendees (again, patches are very, very welcome).
	  Features include: Querying a calendar for events over a specific
	  time range Checking a calendar's busy status via the dialplan
	  Writing calendar events via the dialplan (CalDAV and Exchange
	  only) Handling calendar event notifications through the dialplan

	  source when responding to a reinvite with 491. When we receive a
	  SIP reinvite, it is possible that we may not be able to process
	  the reinvite immediately since we have also sent a reinvite out
	  ourselves. The problem is that whoever sent us the reinvite may
	  have also sent a reinvite out to another party, and that reinvite
	  may have succeeded. As a result, even though we are not going to
	  accept the reinvite we just received, it is important for us to
	  not have problems if we suddenly start receiving RTP from a new
	  source. The fix for this is to grab the media source information
	  from the SDP of the reinvite that we receive. This information is
	  passed to the RTP layer so that it will know about the alternate

	  used for outbound connections. This patch changes this. Now the
	  default transport type is only used until the peer registers.
	  When registration takes place the transport type is parsed out of
	  the Contact header. If the Contact header's transport type is
	  equal to one that the peer supports, the peer's default transport
	  type for outbound connections is set to match the Contact
	  header's type. If the Contact header's transport type is not
	  present, then the peer's default transport type is set to match
	  the one the peer registered with. When a peer unregisters or the
	  registration expires, the default transport type for that peer is

	  chooses the cdr record to base the bridged_cdr on. Previously the

	  cdr record is chosen and forked cdr records are moved to the
	  bridge_cdr. This allows the original cdr record and any forked

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Add basic support
	  for handling connected line-related UPDATE requests. SIP purists
	  may want to look the other way... When COLP/CONP support for SIP
	  was committed, there was a condition under which Asterisk may
	  transmit a SIP UPDATE in order to communicate the change in
	  connected line information. The issue here is that while we could
	  send a SIP UPDATE message, we were not prepared to receive such
	  an UPDATE and would always responde with a 501 when we received
	  an UPDATE. The situation was a bit rough. We really want to be
	  able to receive UPDATEs having to do with connected line changes,
	  but the amount of effort involved in properly supporting RFC 3311
	  was staggering. This commit represents a compromise. First, it
	  was decided that it is important to only send a SIP UPDATE to an
	  endpoint that is able to handle one. So, now we have added
	  parsing of the Allow header into SIP. We store the allowed
	  methods on SIP peers so that when we communicate with them, we
	  already will know what we can and cannot send to them. We will
	  parse the peer's allowed methods when he registers with us. If
	  the peer is not the type to register with us, but the qualify
	  option is enabled, then we will use the response to the OPTIONS
	  request we send the peer to determine the peer's allowed methods.
	  When the peer's registration expires, or when qualify deems the
	  peer to be unreachable, we clear the allowed methods from the
	  peer. For an actual call, we will copy the peer's allowed methods
	  to the sip_pvt representing the call leg. If we are communicating
	  with an endpoint which is not a peer, then we will just parse the
	  Allow header from the first message we receive during the call
	  and store the information in the sip_pvt. If, during
	  communication with a peer, we receive a 501 response, then we
	  will make sure to save the fact that we cannot use that method
	  when communicating with that peer. Now, with all that
	  infrastructure in place, the only actual place we use this
	  information currently is when attempting to send a connected line
	  change using an UPDATE request. If we cannot send the change
	  immediately using an UPDATE, we will set the SIP_NEEDREINVITE
	  flag so that we can send a REINVITE as soon as it is allowed. The
	  second part of the changes here is for Asterisk to accept UPDATE
	  requests that have connected line changes. Since we are not fully
	  supporting RFC 3311, Asterisk will NOT place the UPDATE method in
	  Allow headers it sends. Instead, if you are communicating with
	  what you know to be another Asterisk box, you may set the
	  rpid_update parameter in sip.conf so that we will send UPDATEs to
	  that Asterisk box. When we send a connected line update, we set a
	  custom header called "X-Asterisk-rpid-update." On the receiving
	  end, if Asterisk receives an UPDATE that does not have the
	  "X-Asterisk-rpid-update" header present, then Asterisk will
	  respond with a 501 since media-changing UPDATEs are not
	  supported. We should never get such UPDATEs, since as was stated
	  earlier, Asterisk does not put UPDATE in its Allow header. If the
	  custom header is present in the received UPDATE, though, then we
	  will check the incoming request for connected line updates and
	  queue the update on the channel where the change occurred.

	  2009) | 24 lines Fix a race condition where a reinvite could
	  trigger a 482 response. The loop detection/spiral detection code
	  in chan_sip used the owner channel's state as a criterion for
	  determining if the incoming INVITE is a looped request. The
	  problem with this is that the INVITE-handling code happens in a
	  different thread than the thread that marks the owner channel as
	  being up. As a result, if a reinvite were to come in very
	  quickly, say from another Asterisk on the same LAN, it was
	  possible for the reinvite to arrive before the owner channel had
	  been set to the up state. This patch corrects the problem by
	  using the invitestate of the sip_pvt instead, since that can be
	  guaranteed to be set correctly by the time the reinvite arrives.
	  Since there is a switch statement further in the INVITE-handling
	  code, the AST_STATE_RINGING state also checks the invitestate of
	  the sip_pvt in case we should actually be treating the channel as
	  if it were up already. (closes issue #12215) Reported by: jpyle

	* main/pbx.c, main/logger.c: Two fixes found while debugging with

	  an error, because the memory was allocated internally to libc,
	  where we could not intercept that call to wrap it. Therefore,
	  it's not memory we knew about, and the free is reported as an
	  error. 2) Now that channels are objects, the old hack of
	  initializing a channel to all zeroes no longer works, since we
	  may try to call something like ast_channel_lock() within a
	  function on that reference. In that case, it's reported as an
	  error, because the pointer isn't an object reference.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Update spiral support in trunk and 1.6.X to
	  match what is in 1.4. In 1.4, a SIP spiral is treated the same
	  way as a call forward. This works much better than what is
	  currently in trunk and 1.6.X. The code in trunk and 1.6.X did not
	  create a new call to the recipient of the spiral, instead trying
	  to continue the same call. In addition to just being plain wrong,
	  this also had the side effect of only being able to spiral calls
	  to other SIP channels. With this in place, as long as call
	  forwards are honored, SIP spirals will work properly. This means
	  that it will work for outbound calls made by the Queue, Dial, and
	  Page applications. For originated calls and spool calls, however,
	  the spiral will not work properly until a generic call forward
	  mechanism is introduced into Asterisk. (relates to issue #13630)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: TCP not matching valid peer. find_peer()
	  does not find a valid peer when using pvt->recv as the
	  sockaddr_in argument. Because of the way TCP works, the port
	  number in pvt->recv is not what we're looking for at all. There
	  is currently only one place that find_peer searches for a peer
	  using the sockaddr_in argument. If the peer is not found after
	  using pvt->recv (works for UDP since the port number will be
	  correct), a temp sockaddr_in struct is made using the Contact
	  header in the sip_request. This has the correct port number in

	  REDIRECTING(to-xxx,i) and the REDIRECTING(from-xxx,i) values. The
	  PTP call will update the redirecting-to presentation when it
	  becomes available and queue the redirecting update to the calling
	  channel.

	  configs/http.conf.sample: Consistent SSL/TLS options across conf
	  files ast_tls_read_conf() is a new api call for handling SSL/TLS
	  options across all conf files. Before this change, SSL/TLS
	  options were not consistent. http.conf and manager.conf required
	  the 'ssl' prefix while sip.conf used options with the 'tls'
	  prefix. While the options had different names in different conf
	  files, they all did the exact same thing. Now, instead of mixing
	  'ssl' or 'tls' prefixes to do the same thing depending on what
	  conf file you're in, all SSL/TLS options use the 'tls' prefix.
	  For example. 'sslenable' in http.conf and manager.conf is now
	  'tlsenable' which matches what already existed in sip.conf. Since
	  this has the potential to break backwards compatibility, previous
	  options containing the 'ssl' prefix still work, but they are no
	  longer documented in the sample.conf files. The change is noted
	  in the CHANGES file though. Review:

	  Convert the ast_channel data structure over to the astobj2
	  framework. There is a lot that could be said about this, but the
	  patch is a big improvement for performance, stability, code
	  maintainability, and ease of future code development. The channel
	  list is no longer an unsorted linked list. The main container for
	  channels is an astobj2 hash table. All of the code related to
	  searching for channels or iterating active channels has been
	  rewritten. Let n be the number of active channels. Iterating the
	  channel list has gone from O(n^2) to O(n). Searching for a
	  channel by name went from O(n) to O(1). Searching for a channel
	  by extension is still O(n), but uses a new method for doing so,
	  which is more efficient. The ast_channel object is now a
	  reference counted object. The benefits here are plentiful. Some
	  benefits directly related to issues in the previous code include:
	  1) When threads other than the channel thread owning a channel
	  wanted access to a channel, it had to hold the lock on it to
	  ensure that it didn't go away. This is no longer a requirement.
	  Holding a reference is sufficient. 2) There are places that now
	  require less dealing with channel locks. 3) There are places
	  where channel locks are held for much shorter periods of time. 4)
	  There are places where dealing with more than one channel at a
	  time becomes _MUCH_ easier. ChanSpy is a great example of this.
	  Writing code in the future that deals with multiple channels will
	  be much easier. Some additional information regarding channel
	  locking and reference count handling can be found in channel.h,
	  where a new section has been added that discusses some of the
	  rules associated with it. Mark Michelson also assisted with the
	  development of this patch. He did the conversion of ChanSpy and
	  introduced a new API, ast_autochan, which makes it much easier to
	  deal with holding on to a channel pointer for an extended period
	  of time and having it get automatically updated if the channel
	  gets masqueraded. Mark was also a huge help in the code review
	  process. Thanks to David Vossel for his assistance with this
	  branch, as well. David did the conversion of the DAHDIScan
	  application by making it become a wrapper for ChanSpy internally.
	  The changes come from the
	  svn/asterisk/team/russell/ast_channel_ao2 branch. Review:

	* channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx, channels/chan_h323.c,
	  channels/h323/chan_h323.h: Make chan_h323 respect packetization
	  settings and fix small reload issue. Previously, packetization
	  settings were ignored and now they are not. A new config option
	  'autoframing' has been added to mirror the way chan_sip handles
	  it. Turning on the autoframing option (available both as a global
	  option or per peer) overrides the local settings with the remote
	  packetization settings. Testing was performed with varying
	  packetization levels with the following codecs: ulaw, alaw, gsm,
	  and g729. Also, an unrelated config reload issue has been fixed
	  in the case of the config file not changing. (closes issue

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fixes segfault when switching UDP to TCP in
	  sip.conf after reload. If transport in sip.conf is switched from
	  UDP to TCP, Asterisk segfaults right after issuing a sip reload.
	  The problem is the socket type is changed to TCP but the fd may
	  still be present for UDP. Later, when the TCP session should be
	  created or set using an existing one, it isn't because the old
	  file descriptor is still present. Now every time transport is
	  changed during a sip.conf reload, the file descriptor is set to
	  -1, signifying it must be created or found. (closes issue #14727)

	  Differentiate between literal characters in an extension and
	  characters that should be treated as a pattern match. Prior to
	  these fixes, an extension such as NNN would be treated as a
	  pattern, rather than a literal string of N's. 2. Fixed the logic
	  used when matching an extension with a bracketed expression, such
	  as 2[5-7]6. 3. Removed all areas of code that were executed when
	  NOT_NOW was #defined. The code in these areas had the potential
	  to crash, for one thing, and the actual intent of these blocks
	  seemed counterproductive. 4. Fixed many many coding guidelines
	  problems I encountered while looking through the corresponding

	  added to chan_dahdi.conf and is noted in the sample config file.
	  The service message support is turned off by default. The current
	  implementation relies on AstDB to keep track of channel state,
	  which allows the statuses to be preserved across Asterisk
	  restarts. Below is a description of the storage format. The state
	  and reason for the service state are in the form
	  <state>:<reason>, where: <state> ::= { 'O' } // 'O' – Out Of
	  Service <reason> ::= { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' }, where: '0' – No
	  reason (backwards compatibility) '1' – NEAR END '2' – FAR END '3'
	  – both NEAR and FAR END The new CLI commands to handle channel
	  service state are: pri service disable channel <chan> pri service
	  enable channel <chan> Many people contributed to the development

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Use safe macro practices even though they
	  really aren't necessary.

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Fix a crash in res_musiconhold when using
	  cached realtime moh. The moh_register function links an mohclass
	  and then immediately unrefs the class since the container now has
	  a reference. The problem with using realtime music on hold is
	  that the class is allocated, registered, and started in one fell
	  swoop. The refcounting logic resulted in the count being off by
	  one. The same problem did not happen when using a static config
	  because the allocation and registration of an mohclass is a
	  separate operation from starting moh. This also did not affect
	  non-cached realtime moh because the classes are not registered at
	  all. I also have modified res_musiconhold to use the _t_ variants
	  of the ao2_ functions so that more info can be gleaned when
	  attempting to trace the refcounts. I found this to be incredibly
	  helpful for debugging this issue and there's no good reason to
	  remove it. (closes issue #14661) Reported by: sum

	* main/channel.c, main/features.c, include/asterisk/channel.h: Add
	  timer for features so that backup bridge config can go away The
	  biggest change done here was elimination of the backup_config for
	  use with features. Previously, the bridging code upon detecting a
	  feature would set the start time of the bridge to the start time
	  of the feature. Then after the feature had either expired or
	  timed out the start time would be reset to the true bridge start
	  time from the backup_config. Now, the time differences are
	  calculated with respect to the newly added feature_start_time
	  timeval instead. There should be no behavior changes from the
	  previous functionality aside from the bridge timing being
	  unaffected by either valid or partial feature matches. Previously
	  the timing would be increased by the length of time configured
	  for featuredigittimeout, which was probably never noticed.

	  message printed in ast_read(). "ast_read() called with no
	  recorded file descriptor" is a new message added after a bug was
	  discovered. Unfortunately, it seems there are a bunch of places
	  that potentially make such calls to ast_read() and trigger this
	  error message to be displayed. This commit does two things to
	  help to make this message appear less. First, the message has
	  been downgraded to a debug level message if dev mode is not
	  enabled. The message means a lot more to developers than it does
	  to end users, and so developers should take an effort to be sure
	  to call ast_read only when a channel is ready to be read from.
	  However, since this doesn't actually cause an error in operation
	  and is not something a user can easily fix, we should not spam
	  their console with these messages. Second, the message has been
	  moved to after the check for any pending masquerades. ast_read()
	  being called with no recorded file descriptor should not
	  interfere with a masquerade taking place. This could be seen as a
	  simple way of resolving issue #14723. However, I still want to
	  try to clear out the existing ways of triggering this message,
	  since I feel that would be a better resolution for the issue.

	  | 21 lines Fix a memory leak in cdr_radius. I came across this
	  while doing some testing of my ast_channel_ao2 branch. After
	  running a test overnight that generated over 5 million calls,
	  Asterisk had taken up about 1 GB of my system memory. So, I
	  re-ran the test with MALLOC_DEBUG turned on. However, it showed
	  no leaks in Asterisk during the test, even though Asterisk was
	  still consuming it somehow. Instead, I turned to valgrind, which
	  when run with --leak-check=full, told me exactly where the leak
	  came from, which was from allocations inside the radiusclient-ng
	  library. This explains why MALLOC_DEBUG did not report it. After
	  a bit of analysis, I found that we were leaking a little bit of
	  memory every time a CDR record was passed to cdr_radius. I don't
	  actually have a radius server set up to receive CDR records.
	  However, I always have my development systems compile and install
	  all modules. In addition to making sure there are not build
	  errors across modules, always loading modules helps find bugs
	  like this, too, so it is strongly recommend for all developers.

	  and re-Invites never executing after a 491 Acknowledgement for
	  491 responses were never being processed because it didn't match
	  our pending invite's seqno. Since the ACK was never processed,
	  the 491 frame would continue to be retransmitted until eventually
	  the call was dropped due to max retries. Now during a pending
	  invite, if we receive another invite, we send an 491 and hold on
	  to that glare invite's seqno in the "glareinvite" variable for
	  that sip_pvt struct. When ACK's are received, we first check to
	  see if it is in response to our pending invite, if not we check
	  to see if it is in response to a glare invite. In this case, it
	  is in response to the glare invite and must be dealt with or the
	  call is dropped. I've changed the wait time for resending the
	  re-Invite after receving a 491 response to comply with RFC 3261.
	  Before this patch the scheduled re-Invite would only change a

	* main/utils.c, include/asterisk/stringfields.h: Optimizations to
	  the stringfields API This patch provides a number of
	  optimizations to the stringfields API, focused around saving (not
	  wasting) memory whenever possible. Thanks to Mark Michelson for
	  inspiring this work and coming up with the first two
	  optimizations that are represented here: Changes: - Cleanup of
	  some code, fix incorrect doxygen comments - When a field is
	  emptied or replaced with a new allocation, decrease the amount of
	  'active' space in the pool it was held in; if that pool reaches
	  zero active space, and is not the current pool, then free it as
	  it is no longer in use - When allocating a pool, try to allocate
	  a size that will fit in a 'standard' malloc() allocation without
	  wasting space - When allocating space for a field, store the
	  amount of space in the two bytes immediately preceding the field;
	  this eliminates the need to call strlen() on the field when
	  overwriting it, and more importantly it 'remembers' the amount of
	  space the field has available, even if a shorter string has been
	  stored in it since it was allocated - Don't automatically double
	  the size of each successive pool allocated; it's wasteful

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Improve performance of the code handling
	  the frame queue in chan_iax2. In my tests that exercised full
	  frame handling in chan_iax2, the version with these changes took
	  30% to 40% of the CPU time compared to the same test of Asterisk
	  trunk before these modifications. While doing some profiling for
	  <http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/205/>, one function that caught
	  my eye was network_thread() in chan_iax2.c. After the things that
	  I was working on there, it was the next target for analysis and
	  optimization. I used oprofile's source annotation functionality
	  and found that the loop traversing the frame queue in
	  network_thread() was to blame for the excessive CPU cycle
	  consumption. The frame_queue in chan_iax2 previously held all
	  frames that either were pending transmission or had been
	  transmitted and are still pending acknowledgment. In
	  network_thread(), the previous code would go back through the
	  main for loop after reading a single incoming frame or after
	  being signaled because a frame had been queued up for initial
	  transmission. In each iteration of the loop, it traverses the
	  entire frame queue looking for frames that need to be
	  transmitted. On a busy server, this could easily be quite a few
	  entries. This patch is actually quite simple. The frame_queue has
	  become only a list of frames pending acknowledgment. Frames that
	  need to be transmitted are queued up to a dedicated transmit
	  thread via the taskprocessor API. As a result, the code in
	  network_thread() becomes much simpler, as its only job is to read
	  incoming frames. In addition to the previously described changes,
	  this patch includes some additional changes to the frame_queue.
	  Instead of one big frame_queue, now there is a list per call
	  number to further reduce wasted list traversals. The biggest
	  impact of this change is in socket_process(). For additional
	  details on testing and test results, see the review request.

	  Mar 2009) | 35 lines Fix incorrect parsing in chan_gtalk when
	  xmpp contains extra whitespaces To drill into the xmpp to find
	  the capabilities between channels, chan_gtalk calls iks_child()
	  and iks_next(). iks_child() and iks_next() are functions in the
	  iksemel xml parsing library that traverse xml nodes. The bug here
	  is that both iks_child() and iks_next() will return the next
	  iks_struct node *regardless* of type. chan_gtalk expects the next
	  node to be of type IKS_TAG, which in most cases, it is, but in
	  this case (a call being made from the Empathy IM client), there
	  exists iks_struct nodes which are not IKS_TAG data (they are
	  extraneous whitespaces), and chan_gtalk doesn't handle that case,
	  so capabilities don't match, and a call cannot be made.
	  iks_first_tag() and iks_next_tag(), on the other hand, will not
	  return the very next iks_struct, but will check to see if the
	  next iks_struct is of type IKS_TAG. If it isn't, it will be
	  skipped, and the next struct of type IKS_TAG it finds will be
	  returned. This assures that chan_gtalk will find the iks_struct
	  it is looking for. This fix simply changes all calls to
	  iks_child() and iks_next() to become calls to iks_first_tag() and
	  iks_next_tag(), which resolves the capability matching. The
	  following is a payload listing from Empathy, which, due to the
	  extraneous whitespace, will not be parsed correctly by iksemel:

	  2009) | 39 lines Fix queue weight behavior so that calls in
	  low-weight queues are not inappropriately blocked. (This is
	  copied and pasted from the review request I made for this patch)
	  Asterisk has some odd behavior when queue weights are used. The
	  current logic used when potentially calling a queue member is: If
	  the member we are going to call is part of another queue and
	  _that other queue has any callers in it_ and has a higher weight
	  than the queue we are calling from, then don't try to contact
	  that member. The issue here is what I have marked with
	  underscores. If the higher-weighted queue has any callers in it
	  at all, then the queue member will be unreachable from the
	  lower-weighted queue. This has the potential to be really really
	  bad if using a queue strategy, such as leastrecent or
	  fewestcalls, with the potential to call the same member
	  repeatedly. The fix proposed by garychen on issue 13220 is very
	  simple and, as far as I can see, works well for this situation.
	  With this set of changes, the logic used becomes: If the member
	  we are going to call is part of another queue, the other queue
	  has a higher weight than the queue we are calling from, and the
	  higher weight queue has at least as many callers as available
	  members, then do not try to contact the queue member. If the
	  higher weighted queue has fewer callers than available members,
	  then there is no reason to deny the call to this member since the
	  other queue can afford to spare a member. Since the fix involved
	  writing a generic function for determining the number of
	  available members in the queue, I also modified the is_our_turn
	  function to make use of the new num_available_members function to
	  determine if it is our turn to try calling a member. There is one
	  small behavior change. Before writing this patch, if you had
	  autofill disabled, then if you were the head caller in a queue,
	  you would automatically be told that it was your turn to try
	  calling a member. This did not take into account whether there
	  were actually any queue members available to take the call. Now
	  we actually make sure there is at least one member available to
	  take the call if autofill is disabled. (closes issue #13220)

	  Asterisk trunk lock up instantly when we started generating a
	  bunch of calls. The backtraces of locked threads were bizarre,
	  and many were stuck on an _unlock_ of an rwlock. The changes are:
	  1) Fix a number of places where a backtrace would be loaded into
	  an invalid index of the backtrace array. It's an off by one
	  error, which ends up writing over the rwlock itself. 2) Ensure
	  that in the array of held locks, we NULL out an index once it is
	  not being used so that it's not confusing when analyzing its
	  contents. 3) Remove a bunch of logging referring to an rwlock
	  operating being done with "deep reentrancy". It is normal for
	  _many_ threads to hold a read lock on an rwlock.

	  Improve performance of the ast_event cache functionality. This
	  code comes from svn/asterisk/team/russell/event_performance/.
	  Here is a summary of the changes that have been made, in order of
	  both invasiveness and performance impact, from smallest to
	  largest. 1) Asterisk 1.6.1 introduces some additional logic to be
	  able to handle distributed device state. This functionality comes
	  at a cost. One relatively minor change in this patch is that the
	  extra processing required for distributed device state is now
	  completely bypassed if it's not needed. 2) One of the things that
	  I noticed when profiling this code was that a _lot_ of time was
	  spent doing string comparisons. I changed the way strings are
	  represented in an event to include a hash value at the front. So,
	  before doing a string comparison, we do an integer comparison on
	  the hash. 3) Finally, the code that handles the event cache has
	  been re-written. I tried to do this in a such a way that it had
	  minimal impact on the API. I did have to change one API call,
	  though - ast_event_queue_and_cache(). However, the way it works
	  now is nicer, IMO. Each type of event that can be cached (MWI,
	  device state) has its own hash table and rules for hashing and
	  comparing objects. This by far made the biggest impact on
	  performance. For additional details regarding this code and how
	  it was tested, please see the review request. (closes issue

	  disconnect a call before the other side answers, only '*' will
	  work, regardless if the disconnect option is set to something
	  else. This is because features are unavailable until bridging
	  takes place. The default disconnect option, '*', was hardcoded in
	  app_dial, which doesn't make any sense from a user perspective
	  since they may expect it to be something different. This patch
	  allows features to be detected from outside of the bridge, but
	  not operated on. In this case, the disconnect feature can be
	  detected before briding and handled outside of features.c.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Improve our triggering of a T38 switchover
	  internally when triggered by a received reinvite. Previously we
	  reached across the channel bridge to get the other party's SIP
	  dialog structure in order to trigger an outgoing reinvite. This
	  is extremely dangerous to do and only works if bridged to another
	  SIP channel. This patch changes this to use the T38 control frame
	  method of requesting a switchover. This change also causes the
	  SIP channel driver to propogate back whether the switchover
	  worked or not instead of blindly accepting the incoming T38
	  reinvite. Review: http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/200/

	  | 44 lines Fix cases where the internal poll() was not being used
	  when it needed to be. We have seen a number of problems caused by
	  poll() not working properly on Mac OSX. If you search around,
	  you'll find a number of references to using select() instead of
	  poll() to work around these issues. In Asterisk, we've had poll.c
	  which implements poll() using select() internally. However, we
	  were still getting reports of problems. vadim investigated a bit
	  and realized that at least on his system, even though we were
	  compiling in poll.o, the system poll() was still being used. So,
	  the primary purpose of this patch is to ensure that we're using
	  the internal poll() when we want it to be used. The changes are:
	  1) Remove logic for when internal poll should be used from the
	  Makefile. Instead, put it in the configure script. The logic in
	  the configure script is the same as it was in the Makefile.
	  Ideally, we would have a functionality test for the problem, but
	  that's not actually possible, since we would have to be able to
	  run an application on the _target_ system to test poll()
	  behavior. 2) Always include poll.o in the build, but it will be
	  empty if AST_POLL_COMPAT is not defined. 3) Change uses of poll()
	  throughout the source tree to ast_poll(). I feel that it is good
	  practice to give the API call a new name when we are changing its
	  behavior and not using the system version directly in all cases.
	  So, normally, ast_poll() is just redefined to poll(). On systems
	  where AST_POLL_COMPAT is defined, ast_poll() is redefined to
	  ast_internal_poll(). 4) Change poll() in main/poll.c to be
	  ast_internal_poll(). It's worth noting that any code that still
	  uses poll() directly will work fine (if they worked fine before).
	  So, for example, out of tree modules that are using poll() will
	  not stop working or anything. However, for modules to work
	  properly on Mac OSX, ast_poll() needs to be used. (closes issue

	  arrive. Again, though, it discards any control frames, or
	  non-voice media frames. This patch rectifies this situation, by
	  storing all incoming frames during the delay period on a list,
	  and then requeuing them onto the channel before returning to the
