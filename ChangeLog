	* many files: alphabetize options in applicaiton descriptions
	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Use an enum to define iax peer/user flags as well as the pvt structure state.  Use the ast_flags macros for checking or setting the state.

	* many files: Add doxygen updates to categorize modules into groups. Convert a lot of comments over to doxygen style. Add some text giving a basic overview of channels.
	* many files: Update applications to add an exit status variable, make priority jumping optional, and use new args parsing macros
	* pbx.c cdr.c res/res_features.c apps/app_dial.c include/asterisk/cdr.h: Convert some built-in applications to use new args parsing macros.  Change ast_cdr_reset to take a pointer to an ast_flags structure instead of an integer for flags.
	* channels/chan_agent.c: Don't loop forever on an invalid options string

	* asterisk.c: don't include asterisk/build.h (it's unnecessary)
	* cli.c: don't include asterisk/build.h, use extern references to buildinfo.c
	* buildinfo.c: new file to hold version info strings

2005-11-04  Russell Bryant  <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Create a function that stores a peer's status in a given buffer.  Use this function in "iax2 show peers" and "iax2 show peer <peername>".  Also, add the peer's status as an option to the IAXPEER dialplan function.

2005-11-04  Kevin P. Fleming  <kpfleming@digium.com>

	(mixmonitor_exec): same

	* res/res_features.c (ast_feature_request_and_dial): ensure that channel variables are inherited from the channel placing the call (issue #5499)
