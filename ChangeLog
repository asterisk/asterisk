	* AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests

	  The HTTP request processing in res_http_websocket allocates additional
	  space on the stack for various headers received during an Upgrade request.
	  An attacker could send a specially crafted request that causes this code
	  to overflow the stack, resulting in a crash.

	  * No longer allocate memory from the stack in a loop to parse the header
	  values.  NOTE: There is a slight API change when using the passed in
	  strings as is.  We now require the passed in strings to no longer have
	  leading or trailing whitespace.  This isn't a problem as the only callers
	  have already done this before passing the strings to the affected
	  function.

	* chan_sip: improved ip:port finding of peers for non-UDP transports.

	  Also remove function peer_ipcmp_cb since it's not used (according to
	  rmudgett).

	  Prior to b2c4e8660a9c89d07041271371151779b7ec75f6 (ASTERISK_27457)
	  insecure=port was the defacto standard.  That commit also prevented
	  insecure=port from being applied for sip/tcp or sip/tls.

	  Into consideration there are three sets of behaviour:

	  1.  "previous" - before the above commit.
	  2.  "current" - post above commit, pre this one.
	  3.  "new" - post this commit.

	  The problem that the above commit tried to address was guests over TCP.
	  It succeeded in doing that but broke transport!=udp with host!=dynamic.

	  This commit attempts to restore sane behaviour with respect to
	  transport!=udp for host!=dynamic whilst still retaining the guest users
	  over tcp.

	  It should be noted that when looking for a peer, two passes are made, the
	  first pass doesn't have SIP_INSECURE_PORT set for the searched-for peer,
	  thus looking for full matches (IP + Port), the second pass sets
	  SIP_INSECURE_PORT, thus expecting matches on IP only where the matched
	  peer allows for that (in the author's opinion:  UDP with insecure=port,
	  or any TCP based, non-dynamic host).

	  In previous behaviour there was special handling for transport=tcp|tls
	  whereby a peer would match during the first pass if the utilized
	  transport was TCP|TLS (and the peer allowed that specific transport).

	  This behaviour was wrong, or dubious at best.  Consider two dynamic tcp
	  peers, both registering from the same IP (NAT), in this case either peer
	  could match for connections from an IP.  It's also this behaviour that
	  prevented SIP guests over tcp.

	  The above referenced commit removed this behaviour, but kept applying
	  the SIP_INSECURE_PORT only to WS|WSS|UDP.  Since WS and WSS is also TCP
	  based, the logic here should fall into the TCP category.

	  This patch updates things such that the previously non-explicit (TCP
	  behaviour) transport test gets performed explicitly (ie, matched peer
	  must allow for the used transport), as well as the indeterministic
	  source-port nature of the TCP protocol is taken into account.  The new
	  match algorithm now looks like:

	  1.  As per previous behaviour, IP address is matched first.

	  2.  Explicit filter with respect to transport protocol, previous
	      behaviour was semi-implied in the test for TCP pure IP match - this now
	      made explicit.

	  3.  During first pass (without SIP_INSECURE_PORT), always match on port.

	  4.  If doing UDP, match if matched against peer also has
	      SIP_INSECURE_PORT, else don't match.

	  5.  Match if not a dynamic host (for non-UDP protocols)

	  6.  Don't match if this is WS|WSS, or we can't trust the Contact address
	      (presumably due to NAT)

	  7.  Match (we have a valid Contact thus if the IP matches we have no
	      choice, this will likely only apply to non-NAT).

	  To logic-test this we need a few different scenarios.  Towards this end,
	  I work with a set number of peers defined in sip.conf:

	  [peer1]
	  host=1.1.1.1
	  transport=tcp

	  [peer2]
	  host=1.1.1.1
	  transport=udp

	  [peer3]
	  host=1.1.1.1
	  port=5061
	  insecure=port
	  transport=udp

	  [peer4]
	  host=1.1.1.2
	  transport=udp,tcp

	  [peer5]
	  host=dynamic
	  transport=udp,tcp

	  Test cases for UDP:

	  1 - incoming UDP request from 1.1.1.1:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer1 or peer2 if from port 5060 (indeterminate, depends on peer
	          ordering)
	        * peer3 if from port 5061
	        * peer5 if registered from 1.1.1.1 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer3
	    - current: as per previous.
	    - new:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer2 if from port 5060
	        * peer3 if from port 5061
	        * peer5 if registered from 1.1.1.1 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer3

	  2 - incoming UDP request from 1.1.1.2:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from 1.1.1.2 and port matches
	        * peer4 if source port is 5060
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest)
	    - current: as previous.
	    - new as previous (with the variation that if peer5 didn't have udp as
	            allowed transport it would not match peer5 whereas previous
	            and current code could).

	  3 - incoming UDP request from anywhere else:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from that address and source port matches.
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer5 if insecure=port is additionally set.
	        * no match (guest)
	    - current - as per previous
	    - new - as per previous

	  Test cases for TCP based transports:

	  4 - incoming TCP request from 1.1.1.1
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1 (indeterministic, depends on ordering of peers in memory):
	        * peer1; or
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered from 1.1.1.1 (irrespective of source port); or
	        * peer2 if the source port happens to be 5060; or
	        * peer3 if the source port happens to be 5061.
	      - pass 2: cannot happen since pass 1 will always find a peer.
	    - current:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer1 or peer2 if from source port 5060
	        * peer3 if from source port 5060
	        * peer5 if registered as 1.1.1.1 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest)
	    - new:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer 1 if from port 5060
	        * peer 5 if registered and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer 1

	  5 - incoming TCP request from 1.1.1.2
	    - previous (indeterminate, depends on ordering):
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer4; or
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered from 1.1.1.2
	      - pass 2: cannot happen since pass 1 will always find a peer.
	    - current:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer4 if source port is 5060
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered as 1.1.1.2 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest).
	    - new:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer4 if source port is 5060
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered as 1.1.1.2 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer4

	  6 - incoming TCP request from anywhere else:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from that address
	      - pass 2: cannot happen since pass 1 will always find a peer.
	    - current:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from that address and port matches.
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest)
	    - new: as per current.

	  It should be noted the test cases don't make explicit mention of TLS, WS
	  or WSS.  WS and WSS previously followed UDP semantics, they will now
	  enforce source port matching.  TLS follow TCP semantics.

	  The previous commit specifically tried to address test-case 6, but broke
	  test-cases 4 and 5 in the process.

	  * In destroy_peer(), fixed memory leaks of lookup history strings and
	  qualify transactions when destroying peers.

	  * In destroy_peer(), fixed leaving the registerexpire scheduled callback
	  active when a peer is destroyed on a reload.  The reload marks and sweeps
	  peers so any peers not explicitly configured get destroyed.  Peers created
	  dynamically from the '*' peer will not exist until they re-register after
	  the reload.  These destroyed peers caused memory corruption when the
	  registerexpire timer expired.

	  * Made build_peer() not schedule any callbacks on the '*' peer
	  (empty_eid).  It is a special peer that is cloned to dynamically created
	  peers so it doesn't actually get involved in any message transactions.

	  * Made do_register_expire() remove the dundi/dpeers AstDB entry when a
	  peer registration expires.

	  * Fix deep_copy_peer() to not copy some things that cannot be copied to
	  the cloned peer structure.  Timers, message transactions, and lookup
	  history are specific to a peer instance.

	* CI: Add support for coverage processing.

	  Enable coverage with `./tests/CI/buildAsterisk.sh --coverage`.  This
	  will cause Asterisk to be compiled with coverage support.  It also
	  initializes 'before' coverage data for all sources.  Accept
	  --tested-only to disable modules which are not run by any test.
	  Enabling coverage also sets tested-only true by default.  To build
	  everything with coverage enabled use `--coverage --tested-only=0`.

	  ./tests/CI/processCoverage.sh is used to process the coverage and
	  generate HTML reports.

	  Fix utils/check_expr2 which failed to compiled with coverage enabled.

	  Add status output 5 times per stage of astobj2_test_perf to ensure
	  remote CLI does not timeout when compiled with coverage.  Remote CLI
	  disconnects if no output is received for 60 seconds.  When coverage is
	  enabled it takes about 70 seconds for my laptop to run the stages of
	  this test, so with the change a message is printed every 14 seconds.

	  Pool usage has also been reduced by allocating one for

	* BuildSystem: Enable Jansson in Solaris 11.

	  In Solaris, the header <jansson.h> is in /usr/include/jansson. To find
	  Jansson even in such a subdirectory, the tool pkg-config is queried via
	  AST_PKG_CONFIG_CHECK. For those platforms, which do not list Jansson via
	  pkg-config, the previous check remains and is executed thereafter.

	  Because the check for the NetBSD Editline library uses the tool pkg-config
	  conditionally PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG must be used. Because that check happens
	  earlier than Jansson, it must be placed in front of that.

	  The script configure does some pre-checks for the script configure of the
	  Asterisk internal NetBSD Editline library. The check for the library ncurses
	  should use not use the header <curses.h> but <ncurses.h>, because on some
	  platforms <curses.h> is not a drop-in replacement for <ncurses.h>: For example
	  in Solaris, the symbol initscr is a typedef in <curses.h> to a symbol which

	* res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Added regex support to match_header

	  This patch adds regular expression support to make the identify section's
	  match_header option more useful when attempting to match complex headers
	  like the 'To' or 'From' headers.  The 'From' header has variable
	  components such as the tag parameter that you cannot predict.  To specify
	  a regular expression put slashes around the regular expression in place of
	  the header value.

	  [identify-alice]
	  type=identify
	  endpoint=alice
	  match_header=From: /<sip:alice@127\\.0\\.0\\.1>/

	  * Added regex support to match_header so you could match a 'To' header
	  among other complex headers.

	  Fixed reported crashes when trying to match special headers like 'Contact'.
	  The identify section's match_header method used code that assumed you were
	  matching a generic header.  Any other type of header could cause a crash
	  if the header structure variant did not match the generic header enough.

	  * Made use code that will work for any header type instead of code
	  specific to generic headers.

	  Other fixes while in the area:

	  * Made check all headers of the requested name.
	  * Added some more sanity checks to the configured identify matching
	  options when applying the configuration.

	  A problem I've seen countless times is a global or system section
	  for PJSIP not getting applied. This is inevitably the result of
	  the "type=" line missing. This change alleviates that problem.

	  The ability to specify an explicit section name has been
	  added to res_sorcery_config. If the configured section
	  name matches this and there are no unknown things configured
	  the section is taken as being for the given type.

	  Both the PJSIP "global" and "system" types now support this
	  so you can just name your section "global" or "system" and it
	  will be matched and used, even without a "type=" line.

	  Using the keep_alive_interval option can result in a deadlock between the

	  superior in the locking order to the monitored transports ao2 container

	  the container lock when sending the keep alive packet.

	* app_confbridge: Bridge and announcers not removed if conference ends quickly

	  If a conference is ended very quickly after it was created (i.e., the
	  first user immediately hangs up) then the conference bridge and announcer
	  channels are not removed.

	  When a conference is created, the push_announcer() function is added to
	  the playback queue task processor and the conference object reference is
	  bumped.  If a conference is ended while the push_announcer() function is
	  still going then the ao2_cleanup(conference) at the end of
	  push_announcer() will call the destructor function -
	  destroy_conference_bridge().

	  The destroy_conference_bridge() function will then add the
	  hangup_playback() task to the playback queue and will wait for it to end.
	  Since it is already a current task of the playback queue it will wait
	  forever.

	  This patch makes the conference thread call push_announcer() directly.
	  This way the conference object reference bump is not needed.  Since the
	  playback queue task processor is only used by the conference thread
	  itself, there is no danger of trying to play announcements before the
	  announcer is pushed to the bridge.

	* res_pjsip_session:  Add ability to accept multiple sdp answers

	  pjproject by default currently will follow media forked during an INVITE
	  on outbound calls if the To tag is different on a subsequent response as
	  that on an earlier response.  We handle this correctly.  There have
	  been reported cases where the To tag is the same but we still need to
	  follow the media.  The pjproject patch in this commit adds the
	  capability to sip_inv and also adds the capability to control it at
	  runtime.  The original "different tag" behavior was always controllable
	  at runtime but we never did anything with it and left it to default to
	  TRUE.

	  So, along with the pjproject patch, this commit adds options to both the
	  system and endpoint objects to control the two behaviors, and a small
	  logic change to session_inv_on_media_update in res_pjsip_session to
	  control the behavior at the endpoint level.

	  The default behavior for "different tags" remains the same at TRUE and
	  the default for "same tag" is FALSE.

	* chan_iax2: better handling for timeout and EINTR

	  The iax2 module is not handling timeout and EINTR case properly. Mainly when
	  there is an interupt to the kernel thread. In case of ast_io_wait recieves a
	  signal, or timeout it can be an error or return 0 which eventually escapes the
	  thread loop, so that it cant recieve any data. This then causes the modules
	  receive queue to build up on the kernel and stop any communications via iax in
	  asterisk.

	  The proposed patch is for the iax module, so that timeout and EINTR does not
	  exit the thread.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Instead of ./configure use OPENSSL_NO_SRTP.

	  Previously, Asterisk used its script ./configure, to test whether OpenSSL was
	  built with no-srtp (or was simply too old). However, the header file
	  <openssl/opensslconf.h> is the preferred way to detect the local configuration
	  of OpenSSL.

	  As a positive side-effect the script ./configure does not interleave the
	  detection of the Open Settlement Protocol Toolkit (OSPTK) with the detection of
	  individual features of OpenSSL anymore.

	  When endpoint specific ACL rules block a SIP request they respond with a

	  unauthorized response is sent.  This vulnerability just discloses which
	  requests hit a defined endpoint.  The ACL rules cannot be bypassed to gain

	  * Made endpoint specific ACL rules now respond with a 401 unauthorized
	  which is the same as if an endpoint were not identified.  The fix is
	  accomplished by replacing the found endpoint with the artificial endpoint
	  which always fails authentication.

	* pjsip_options: show/reload AOR qualify options using CLI

	  Currentrly pjsip_options code does not handle the situation when the
	  AOR qualify options were changed.

	  Also there is no way to find out what qualify options are using.

	  This patch add CLI commands to show and synchronize Aor qualify options:
	  pjsip show qualify endpoint <id>
	      Show the current qualify options for all Aors on the PJSIP endpoint.
	  pjsip show qualify aor <id>
	      Show the PJSIP Aor current qualify options.
	  pjsip reload qualify endpoint <id>
	      Synchronize the qualify options for all Aors on the PJSIP endpoint.
	  pjsip reload qualify aor <id>
	      Synchronize the PJSIP Aor qualify options.

	* chan_mobile: support handling of caller-id names ("cnam").

	  Add support to handle caller-ID names ("cnam") in addition to caller-ID
	  numbers.  The prior code ignored the caller-ID name altogether, and
	  used the local name for the cell phone (e.g. "my-iphone") in its place.

	  Note: as of this writing, at least some Android phones don't pass cnam to
	  us. This can be seen by issuing "core set debug 2" in the CLI and watching
	  the "CLIP" record when a call comes in.  If cnam isn't in the CLIP record,
	  there's nothing we can do to provide one.  We'll provide a null cnam field,
	  so later Asterisk processes know to try other sources (e.g. cidname database,
	  OpenCNAM, etc.).

	* pjsip: Rewrite OPTIONS support with new eyes.

	  The OPTIONS support in PJSIP has organically grown, like many things in
	  Asterisk.  It has been tweaked, changed, and adapted based on situations
	  run into.  Unfortunately this has taken its toll.  Configuration file
	  based objects have poor performance and even dynamic ones aren't that
	  great.

	  This change scraps the existing code and starts fresh with new eyes.  It
	  leverages all of the APIs made available such as sorcery observers and
	  serializers to provide a better implementation.

	  1.  The state of contacts, AORs, and endpoints relevant to the qualify
	  process is maintained.  This state can be updated by external forces (such
	  as a device registering/unregistering) and also the reload process.  This
	  state also includes the association between endpoints and AORs.

	  2.  AORs are scheduled and not contacts.  This reduces the amount of work
	  spent juggling scheduled items.

	  3.  Manipulation of which AORs are being qualified and the endpoint states
	  all occur within a serializer to reduce the conflict that can occur with
	  multiple threads attempting to modify things.

	  4.  Operations regarding an AOR use a serializer specific to that AOR.

	  5.  AORs and endpoint state act as state compositors.  They take input
	  from lower level objects (contacts feed AORs, AORs feed endpoint state)
	  and determine if a sufficient enough change has occurred to be fed further
	  up the chain.

	  6.  Realtime is supported by using observers to know when a contact has
	  been registered.  If state does not exist for the associated AOR then it
	  is retrieved and becomes active as appropriate.

	  The end result of all of this is best shown with a configuration file of
	  3000 endpoints each with an AOR that has a static contact.  In the old
	  code it would take over a minute to load and use all 8 of my cores.  This
	  new code takes 2-3 seconds and barely touches the CPU even while dealing
	  with all of the OPTIONS requests.

	  If during translation a codec could not handle a given frame the translation
	  core would return NULL, thus not passing along the "missing" frame. Due to this
	  there was no frame to apply generic plc to, thus rendering it useless.

	  This patch makes it so the translation core produces an interpolated slin frame
	  in the cases where an attempt was made to translate to slin, but failed. This
	  interpolated frame is then passed along and can be used by the generic plc
	  algorithms to fill in the frame.

	* bridge_softmix:  Forward TEXT frames

	  Core bridging and, more specifically, bridge_softmix have been
	  enhanced to relay received frames of type TEXT or TEXT_DATA to all
	  participants in a softmix bridge.  res_pjsip_messaging and
	  chan_pjsip have been enhanced to take advantage of this so when
	  res_pjsip_messaging receives an in-dialog MESSAGE message from a
	  user in a conference call, it's relayed to all other participants
	  in the call.

	  res_pjsip_messaging already queues TEXT frames to the channel when
	  it receives an in-dialog MESSAGE from an endpoint and chan_pjsip
	  will send an MESSAGE when it gets a TEXT frame.  On a normal
	  point-to-point call, the frames are forwarded between the two
	  correctly.  bridge_softmix was not though so messages weren't
	  getting forwarded to conference bridge participants.  Even if they
	  were, the bridging code had no way to tell the participants who
	  sent the message so it would look like it came from the bridge
	  itself.

	  * The TEXT frame type doesn't allow storage of any meta data, such
	  as sender, on the frame so a new TEXT_DATA frame type was added that
	  uses the new ast_msg_data structure as its payload.  A channel
	  driver can queue a frame of that type when it receives a message
	  from outside.  A channel driver can use it for sending messages
	  by implementing the new send_text_data channel tech callback and
	  setting the new AST_CHAN_TP_SEND_TEXT_DATA flag in its tech
	  properties.  If set, the bridging/channel core will use it instead
	  of the original send_text callback and it will get the ast_msg_data
	  structure. Channel drivers aren't required to implement this.  Even
	  if a TEXT_DATA enabled driver uses it for incoming messages, an
	  outgoing channel driver that doesn't will still have it's send_text
	  callback called with only the message text just as before.

	  * res_pjsip_messaging now creates a TEXT_DATA frame for incoming
	  in-dialog messages and sets the "from" to the display name in the
	  "From" header, or if that's empty, the caller id name from the
	  channel.  This allows the chat client user to set a friendly name
	  for the chat.

	  * bridge_softmix now forwards TEXT and TEXT_DATA frames to all
	  participants (except the sender).

	  * A new function "ast_sendtext_data" was added to channel which
	  takes an ast_msg_data structure and calls a channel's
	  send_text_data callback, or if that's not defined, the original
	  send_text callback.

	  * bridge_channel now calls ast_sendtext_data for TEXT_DATA frame
	  types and ast_sendtext for TEXT frame types.

	  * chan_pjsip now uses the "from" name in the ast_msg_data structure
	  (if it exists) to set the "From" header display name on outgoing text
	  messages.

	  If the assert passes... NoOp

	  If the assert fails and AST_DEVMODE is defined, execute ast_assert()
	  then, if DO_CRASH isn't set, return from the calling function with
	  the supplied value.

	  If the assert fails and AST_DEVMODE is not defined, return from the
	  calling function with the supplied value.

	  The macro will execute a return without a value if one isn't suppled.

	* res_musiconhold: Don't restart MOH from beginning after announcement.

	  This reverts a problem introduced by the fix for ASTERISK_24329.
	  Now, when an announcement is played while waiting in a queue, music on
	  hold will not restart from the beginning of the sound file and will
	  instead pick up where it left off. However, the incorrect behavior in
	  ASTERISK_24329 is now present again; if an announcement X seconds
	  long is played when music on hold starts, music on hold will start X
	  seconds into the file.

	* res_pjsip.c: Split ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() to fit expectations.

	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() did not necessarily execute the passed in
	  task under the specified serializer.  If the current thread is any
	  registered pjsip thread then it would execute the task immediately instead
	  of under the specified serializer.  Reentrancy issues could result if the
	  task does not execute with the right serializer.

	  The original reason ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() checked to see if the
	  current thread was a registered pjsip thread was because of a deadlock
	  with masquerades and the channel technology's fixup callback
	  (ASTERISK_22936).  A subsequent masquerade deadlock fix (ASTERISK_24356)
	  involving call pickups avoided the original deadlock situation entirely.
	  The PJSIP channel technology's fixup callback no longer needed to call
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous().

	  However, there are a few places where this unexpected behavior is still
	  required to avoid deadlocks.  The pjsip monitor thread executes callbacks
	  that do calls to ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() that would deadlock if
	  the task were actually pushed to the specified serializer.  I ran into one
	  dealing with the pubsub subscriptions where an ao2 destructor called
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous().

	  * Split ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() into
	  ast_sip_push_task_wait_servant() and ast_sip_push_task_wait_serializer().
	  ast_sip_push_task_wait_servant() has the old behavior of
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous().  ast_sip_push_task_wait_serializer() has
	  the new behavior where the task is always executed by the specified
	  serializer or a picked serializer if one is not passed in.  Both functions
	  behave the same if the current thread is not a SIP servant.

	  * Redirected ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() to
	  ast_sip_push_task_wait_servant() to preserve API for released branches.

	* res_pjsip_refer/chan_sip: Fix INVITE with replaces transfer to ConfBridge

	  There is a problem when an INVITE-with-Replaces transfer targets a channel
	  in a ConfBridge.  The transfer will unconditionally swap out the
	  ConfBridge channel.  Unfortunately, the ConfBridge state will not be aware
	  of this change.  Unexpected behavior will happen as a result since
	  ConfBridge channels currently can only be replaced by a masquerade and not
	  normal bridge channel moves.

	  * We just need to pretend that the channel isn't in a bridge (like other
	  transfer methods already do) so the transfer channel will masquerade into
	  the ConfBridge channel.

	* chan_sip.c: Fix INVITE with replaces channel ref leak.

	  Given the below call scenario:
	  A -> Ast1 -> B
	  C <- Ast2 <- B

	  1) A calls B through Ast1
	  2) B calls C through Ast2
	  3) B transfers A to C

	  When party B transfers A to C, B sends a REFER to Ast1 causing Ast1 to
	  send an INVITE with replaces to Ast2.  Ast2 then leaks a channel ref of
	  the channel between Ast1 and Ast2.

	  Channel ref leaks are easily seen in the CLI "core show channels" output.
	  The leaked channels appear in the output but you can do nothing with them
	  and they never go away unless you restart Asterisk.

	  * Properly account for the channel refs when imparting a channel into a
	  bridge when handling an INVITE with replaces in handle_invite_replaces().
	  The ast_bridge_impart() function steals a channel ref but the code didn't
	  account for how many refs were held by the code at the time and which ref
	  was stolen.

	  * Eliminated RAII_VAR in handle_invite_replaces().

	  A deadlock can happen when the PJSIP monitor thread is shutting down a

	* BuildSystem: For consistency, avoid extra libs to be empty.

	  AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK has several optional parameters. When an optional parameter
	  is left empty, [] is used to indicate this. However, this is done in the script

	  no extra libraries are needed to test the checked library, parameter 5 is not
	  mentioned. Except parameter 6 and higher are used, then parameter 5 must be
	  empty.

	  However, this general rule was broken

	  * three times for parameter 4 (header)
	  as found via the Regular Expression \[\]\). In case of parameter 5, all cases
	  were changed, because that happened for no reason. In case of parameter 4, an
	  [] improves readability actually. Therefore for parameter 4, the only case which

	* BuildSystem: Check for header file of OGG.

	  Asterisk uses various symbols of the shared library libogg within the module
	  format_ogg_vorbis. However, the source code of that module did not include the
	  header file of libogg explicitly but implicitly. Because that header was not
	  included before Asterisk 14, the script ./configure was told not to check for
	  it.

	  Anyway, even Asterisk 13 LTS uses symbols of libogg. Therefore, that header
	  should be included explicitly. Therefore, ./configure should check for that
	  header.

	* BuildSystem: Avoid an extra case for OpenBSD.

	  Nine years ago with Mantis 13639 (now ASTERISK-12841) an extra case for OpenBSD
	  was introduced: Vorbis required Ogg to be specified manually, because the shared
	  library libvorbis.so did not specify its required dependency on -logg itself.

	  Today with OpenBSD 6.2, all libvorbis*.so declare their dependencies correctly.
	  Therefore, an extra case is not required anymore.

	* BuildSystem: Enable Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in NetBSD.

	  In the script ./configure, AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK checks for external libraries. Some
	  libraries do not specify all their dependencies and require additional shared
	  libraries. In AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK, this is the fifth parameter. However, if a
	  library is specified there, it must exist on the platform, because ./configure
	  tries to compile/link/execute a small app using those statements. For example,
	  the library libdl.so is Linux specific and does not exist on BSD-like platforms.

	  Furthermore, no supported platform/version was found, which still (ever?)
	  requires those additional libraries. Therefore, they were simply removed.

	  Finally, this change adds the error code ESTRPIPE to the channel driver
	  chan_alsa for those platforms which lack it, again for example NetBSD.

	  it's being passed a non utf-8 string and return an error.

	  * Keypress results passed to ast_test_suite_notify are now checked with
	    isprint() and a '?' is substituted if the check fails.

	* core: Remove non-critical cleanup from startup aborts.

	  When built-in components of Asterisk fail to start they cause the
	  Asterisk startup to abort.  In these cases only the most critical
	  cleanup should be performed - closing databases and terminating
	  proceses.  These cleanups are registered using ast_register_atexit, all
	  other cleanups should not be run during startup abort.

	  The main reason for this change is that these cleanup procedures are
	  untestable from the partially initialized states, if they fail it could
	  prevent us from ever running the critical cleanup with ast_run_atexits.

	  No performance gain is expected by this change. However, because this strategy

	  create more consistency: Only do something different if there is a reason to do

	* pjproject: Add cache_pools debugging option.

	  The pool cache gets in the way of finding use after free errors of memory
	  pool contents.  Tools like valgrind and MALLOC_DEBUG don't know when a
	  pool is released because it gets put into the cache instead of being
	  freed.

	  * Added the "cache_pools" option to pjproject.conf.  Disabling the option
	  helps track down pool content mismanagement when using valgrind or
	  MALLOC_DEBUG.  The cache gets in the way of determining if the pool
	  contents are used after free and who freed it.

	  To disable the pool caching simply disable the cache_pools option in
	  pjproject.conf and restart Asterisk.

	  Sample pjproject.conf setting:
	  [startup]
	  cache_pools=no

	  * Made current users of the caching pool factory initialization and
	  destruction calls call common routines to create and destroy cached pools.

	  Between Asterisk 11 and Asterisk 13 there was a significant increase
	  in the number of AST_FRAME_NULL frames being processed by app_amd.c's

	  when app_amd.c was orginally added, but it is not in Asterisk 13.
	  As such the total analysis time and silence calculations were way

	  parser would skip the following line.

	  Additionally fix comment in voicemail.conf sample config.  It previously
	  stated that emailbody can only contain up to 512 characters which is
	  always wrong.  The buffer is normally 8192 characters unless LOW_MEMORY
	  is enabled then it is 512 characters.  The updated comment states that
	  the line can be up to 8190 or 510 characters since the line feed and
	  NULL terminator each use a character.

	  The transferrer's session channel was destroyed by the transferrer's

	  serializer was attempting to clean up a deferred end status on behalf of

	  transferrer's serializer.  When the transfer target's serializer lost the
	  race then both threads wind up trying to end the transferrer's session.

	  * Push the ast_sip_session_end_if_deferred() call onto the transferrer's
	  serializer to avoid a race condition that results in a crash.  The
	  session_end() function that could be called by
	  ast_sip_session_end_if_deferred() really must be executed by the
	  transferrer's serializer to avoid this kind of crash.

	* AST-2018-005: Fix tdata leaks when calling pjsip_endpt_send_response(2)

	  pjsip_distributor:
	     authenticate() creates a tdata and uses it to send a challenge or
	     failure response.  When pjsip_endpt_send_response2() succeeds, it
	     automatically decrements the tdata ref count but when it fails, it
	     doesn't.  Since we weren't checking for a return status, we weren't
	     decrementing the count ourselves on error and were therefore leaking
	     tdatas.

	  res_pjsip_session:
	     session_reinvite_on_rx_request wasn't decrementing the ref count
	     if an error happened while sending a 491 response.
	     pre_session_setup wasn't decrementing the ref count if
	     while sending an error after a pjsip_inv_verify_request failure.

	     ast_sip_send_response wasn't decrementing the ref count on error.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Prune subs with reliable transports at startup

	  In an earlier release, inbound registrations on a reliable transport
	  were pruned on Asterisk restart since the TCP connection would have
	  been torn down and become unusable when Asterisk stopped.  This same
	  process is now also applied to inbound subscriptions.

	  Also fixed issues in res_pjsip_registrar where it wasn't handling the
	  monitoring correctly when multiple registrations came in over the same
	  transport.

	  To accomplish this, the pjsip_transport_event feature needed to
	  be refactored to allow multiple monitors (multiple subcriptions or
	  registrations from the same endpoint) to exist on the same transport.
	  Since this changed the API, any external modules that may have used the
	  transport monitor feature (highly unlikey) will need to be changed.

	* bridge_softmix.c: Report not talking immediately when muted.

	  Currently in app_confbridge if someone mutes a channel while that channel
	  is talking, the talk detection code is suspended while the channel is
	  muted.  As far an an external observer is concerned, the muted channel's
	  talk status is still "talking" even though the channel is not contributing
	  audio to the conference bridge.  When the channel is later unmuted, it
	  takes the usual 'dsp_silence_threshold' option time to clear the talking
	  status even though the channel may have stopped talking while the channel
	  was muted.

	  * In bridge_softmix.c, clear the talking status and report talking stopped
	  if the channel was talking when the channel is muted.  When the channel is
	  unmuted and the channel is still talking then report the channel as
	  talking since it is contributing audio to the bridge again.

	* res_pjsip: Split type=identify to IP address and SIP header matching priorities

	  The type=identify endpoint identification method can match by IP address
	  and by SIP header.  However, the SIP header matching has limited
	  usefulness because you cannot specify the SIP header matching priority
	  relative to the IP address matching.  All the matching happens at the same
	  priority and the order of evaluating the identify sections is
	  indeterminate.  e.g., If you had two type=identify sections where one
	  matches by IP address for endpoint alice and the other matches by SIP
	  header for endpoint bob then you couldn't predict which endpoint is
	  matched when a request comes in that matches both.

	  * Extract the SIP header matching criteria into its own "header" endpoint
	  identification method so the user can specify the relative priority of the
	  SIP header and the IP address matching criteria in the global
	  endpoint_identifier_order option.  The "ip" endpoint identification method
	  now only matches by IP address.

	  work, the "ip" identifier method configuration must explicitly specify the
	  identified endpoint.  Therefore, why bother configuring the type=identify
	  identifier in the first place?  The requirement only adds the potential

	  errors cannot be detected when the configuration loads.  The requirement

	* cdr_mysql: Make sure connection charset is always set

	  When the MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT option is enabled, the MySQL client API
	  will transparently reconnect when it needs to. Ideally this simplifies
	  our code, but when this reconnection occurs all connection state is
	  lost. Because we are not notified that this has happened, we don't know
	  to set our character set again (with "SET NAMES 'xyz'").

	  Rather than calling SET NAMES, we instead set the MYSQL_SET_CHARSET_NAME
	  option which will do it for us under the hood on each connect. This
	  option has been present in the MySQL C API for at least 15 years, so it
	  should be safe for most installations.

	  I also snuck a few other changes into this patch:

	  * Default the MySQL port to MYSQL_PORT (3306) instead of 0 if it's not
	    defined.

	  * Fix some erroneous and/or silly checks on the contents of the
	    configuration ast_str values.

	* bridge_native_rtp.c: Fix reentrancy framehook crash.

	  If two channels enter different native rtp bridges at the same time it is
	  possible that the framehook interface data pointer can be corrupted
	  because the struct variable was declared static.

	  * Fixed the reentrancy corruption by changing the framehook interface
	  struct static variable to a stack local variable.

	  * Moved the hook.data assignment outside of the channel lock.  It did not
	  need the lock's protection.  It probably was giving a false sense of
	  security.

	  The testsuite
	  channels/pjsip/basic_calls/two_parties/nominal/alice_initiated/bob_hangs_up

	* AST-2017-012: Place single RTCP report block at beginning of report.

	  When the RTCP code was transitioned over to Stasis a code change
	  was made to keep track of how many reports are present. This count

	  If a compound RTCP packet was received this logic would incorrectly
	  place a report block in the wrong location resulting in a write
	  to an invalid location.

	  This change removes this counting logic and always places the report
	  block at the first position. If in the future multiple reports are

	* app_queue: Fix extension state subscriptions removed on dialplan reload

	  The approach with having a single global subscription to all extension
	  state changes has one issue: dynamically created hints don't have any
	  watchers and are therefore garbage collected on the first dialplan
	  reload.

	  This change creates a state subscription for every queue member with a
	  hint as state_interface, thus increasing the count of watches for
	  hints, so they are not destroyed prematurely anymore.

	  There are 2 side effects:
	  1. The state change callback in app_queue is not executed when
	     there are no members referring to the extension.
	  2. The callback is called multiple times for the same hint if it's
	     associated with more than one queue member.

	* pjsip_options: contacts sometimes not being updated on reload

	  For both dynamic and static contacts it was possible that potential AOR
	  changes were not being applied to all contacts. This was because the qualify
	  and schedule code was only retrieving AOR's, and contacts with frequencies
	  greater than zero.

	  For instance the following could happen: and AOR/contact has a frequency of 5,
	  it then gets set to 0, and then a reload occurs. All scheduled OPTIONS are
	  stopped, a list of AOR's is retrieved with frequency > 0, but none are
	  selected since in this scenario all are 0. The contact for the one previously
	  set to 5 though does not get updated, so it's status remains "AVAILABLE".

	  appropriately updated if need be.

	* CLI: Fix remote console completion.

	  Duplicate checking was done incorrectly when parsing completion options
	  from a remote console causing all options to be ignored as duplicates.
	  Once fixed I had to separate processing of the best match to ensure it
	  was not identified as a duplicate when it is the only match.

	* sounds_index: Avoid repeatedly reindexing.

	  The sounds index is rebuilt each time a format is registered or
	  unregistered.  This causes the index to be repeatedly rebuilt during
	  startup and shutdown.

	  This patch significantly reduces the work done by delaying sound index
	  initialization until after modules are loaded.  This way a reindex only
	  occurs if a format module is loaded after startup.  We also skip
	  reindexing when format modules are unloaded during shutdown.

	  Overall sounds_index.c is about 27% of Asterisk startup time when using
	  sample configs.  This patch reduces it to 20%.  This is a half-fix.  The
	  real problem is that the media_index is regenerated repeatedly - 68
	  times in my test.

	* CDR: Fix deadlock setting some CDR values.

	  Setting channel variables with the AMI Originate action caused a deadlock
	  when you set CDR(amaflags) or CDR(accountcode).  This path has the channel
	  locked when the CDR function is called.  The CDR function then
	  synchronously passes the job to a stasis thread.  The stasis handling
	  function then attempts to lock the channel.  Deadlock results.

	  * Avoid deadlock by making the CDR function handle setting amaflags and
	  accountcode directly on the channel rather than passing it off to the CDR
	  processing code under a stasis thread to do it.

	  * Made the CHANNEL function and the CDR function process amaflags the same
	  way.

	  * Fixed referencing the wrong message type in cdr_prop_write().

	* AST-2017-013: chan_skinny: Call pthread_detach when sess threads end

	  chan_skinny creates a new thread for each new session.  In trying
	  to be a good cleanup citizen, the threads are joinable and the
	  unload_module function does a pthread_cancel() and a pthread_join()
	  on any sessions that are active at that time.  This has an
	  unintended side effect though. Since you can call pthread_join on a
	  thread that's already terminated, pthreads keeps the thread's
	  storage around until you explicitly call pthread_join (or
	  pthread_detach()).   Since only the module_unload function was
	  calling pthread_join, and even then only on the ones active at the
	  tme, the storage for every thread/session ever created sticks
	  around until asterisk exits.

	  * A thread can detach itself so the session_destroy() function
	    now calls pthread_detach() just before it frees the session
	    memory allocation.  The module_unload function still takes care
	    of the ones that are still active should the module be unloaded.

	* config: Speed up config template lookup

	  ast_category_get() has an (undocumented) implementation detail where it
	  tries to match the category name first by an explicit pointer comparison
	  and if that fails falls back to a normal match.

	  When initially building an ast_config during ast_config_load, this
	  pointer comparison can never succeed, but we will end up iterating all
	  categories twice. As the number of categories using a template
	  increases, this dual looping becomes quite expensive. So we pass a flag
	  to category_get_sep() indicating if a pointer match is even possible
	  before trying to do so, saving us a full pass over the list of current
	  categories.

	  In my tests, loading a file with 3 template categories and 12000
	  additional categories that use those 3 templates (this file configures
	  4000 PJSIP endpoints with AOR & Auth) takes 1.2 seconds. After this
	  change, that drops to 22ms.

	* config: Speed up ACO & sorcery initialization

	  When starting Asterisk in the foreground, there is a perceptible delay
	  when loading modules that use the ACO and sorcery config frameworks.
	  For example, a lightly configured res_pjsip took 853ms to load on my
	  VM.

	  I tracked down the slowness to the XPath queries used to associate the
	  relevant documentation with the config options. One improvement was
	  adding a call to xmlXPathOrderDocElems after loading an XML document.
	  From the libxml2 docs:

	    Call this routine to speed up XPath computation on static documents.

	  The second change was to remove recursive descent and wildcard
	  operators from the XPath queries. After these changes, res_pjsip takes
	  85ms to load on my VM and there is no longer a perceptible delay when
	  starting Asterisk in the foreground.

	* translate: Transcode siren14, speex32, silk24, and silk12 via slin16.

	  When a format has no pre-recorded sound files, Asterisk has to transcode between
	  formats. For this, Asterisk has a fixed translation table. If the pre-recorded
	  sound files are not available in the same sample rate, Asterisk has not only to
	  transcode but also to resample.

	  Asterisk has pre-recorded files for SLN (8000 kHz) and SLN16 (16000 kHz).
	  However before this change, Asterisk did not take the sample rate into account,
	  because the translation paths to SLN and SLN16 got the same score/weight in the
	  table. Consequently, you might have got narrow-band audio with siren14, speex32,
	  silk24, and silk12 although those are (ultra) wide-band audio codecs.

	  With this change, the distance in sample-rates is taken into account. Now on the
	  Command-Line interface (CLI) 'core show channels', you should see:
	  (slin@16000)->(slin@32000)->(speex@32000).

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix rtp source address learning for broken clients

	  Some clients do not send rtp packets every ptime ms. This can lead to
	  situations in which the rtp source learning algorithm will never learn
	  the address of the client. This has been discovered on a Mac mini with
	  a pjsip based softphone after updating to Sierra: as soon as USB
	  headsets are involved, the softphone will send the second packet 30ms
	  after the first, the third 30ms after the second and the fourth 1ms
	  after the third. So in the old implmentation the rtp source learning
	  algorithm was repeatedly reset on the fourth packet.

	  The patch changes the algorithm in a way that doesn't take the arrival
	  time between two consecutive packets into account but the time between
	  the first and the last packet of a learning sequence.

	  The patch also fixes a second problem: when a user was using a wrong
	  value for the probation setting there was a LOG_WARNING output stating
	  that the value had been set to the default value instead. However
	  the code for setting the value back to defaults was missing.

	* menuselect: Remove ineffective weak attribute detection.

	  menuselect detects compiler support for multiple styles of weak
	  functions.  This is a remnant from 2013 when OPTIONAL_API required weak
	  functions.  It is no longer correct for menuselect to switch
	  dependencies from optional to required based on lack of weak function
	  support.

	  Note an issue remains - dependencies should switch from optional to
	  required based on OPTIONAL_API being enabled or disabled.  I don't think
	  this is possible.  menuselect needs to know at startup if OPTIONAL_API
	  is enabled or disabled, so the only way to fix this is to remove
	  OPTIONAL_API from menuselect and create a configure option.  I've left
	  the code that switches in place but it's preprocessed out.

	  Additionally removed:
	  - WEAKREF variable from Asterisk makeopts.in.
	  - Related disabled code from test_utils.
	  - Pointless AC_REVISION call from menuselect/configure.ac.

	* bridge_basic: Ignore answer from transfer target when they've timed out.

	  This is a fun one.

	  Given the following attended transfer scenario:

	  1. Transfer target is called
	  2. Transferer hangs up
	  3. Transfer target call attempt reaches timeout
	  4. Transfer target is told to hang up
	  5. Transfer target answers before channel is hung up
	  6. Transferer recall target is called

	  A crash would occur. This is because the transfer target call
	  attempt, despite being told to hang up, would raise a recall
	  target answer before the recall target had been answered. As it
	  had not answered there would be no recall target channel and it
	  would implode.

	  This change makes it so that if the transfer target has been
	  hung up we don't tell the attended transfer code that it has
	  answered. We also clear out the stimulus that the recall target
	  has been answered after telling the transfer target to hang up,
	  in case it was able to raise the information before we told it
	  to hangup.

	* core: Add cache_media_frames debugging option.

	  The media frame cache gets in the way of finding use after free errors of
	  media frames.  Tools like valgrind and MALLOC_DEBUG don't know when a
	  frame is released because it gets put into the cache instead of being
	  freed.

	  * Added the "cache_media_frames" option to asterisk.conf.  Disabling the
	  option helps track down media frame mismanagement when using valgrind or
	  MALLOC_DEBUG.  The cache gets in the way of determining if the frame is
	  used after free and who freed it.  NOTE: This option has no effect when
	  Asterisk is compiled with the LOW_MEMORY compile time option enabled
	  because the cache code does not exist.

	  To disable the media frame cache simply disable the cache_media_frames
	  option in asterisk.conf and restart Asterisk.

	  Sample asterisk.conf setting:
	  [options]
	  cache_media_frames=no

	  one directory at a time but allow 8 jobs at once when building a sub
	  directory.

	  This will fix some display glitches related to rebuild of XML
	  documentation.  It will also prevent some edge case errors where
	  bundled pjproject needs to be rebuild before other parts of Asterisk.

	* AST-2017-011 - res_pjsip_session: session leak when a call is rejected

	  A previous commit made it so when an invite session transitioned into a
	  disconnected state destruction of the Asterisk pjsip session object was
	  postponed until either a transport error occurred or the event timer
	  expired. However, if a call was rejected (for instance a 488) before the
	  session was fully established the event timer may not have been initiated,
	  or it was canceled without triggering either of the session finalizing states
	  mentioned above.

	  Really the only time destruction of the session should be delayed is when a
	  BYE is being transacted. This is because it's possible in some cases for the
	  session to be disconnected, but the BYE is still transacting.

	  This patch makes it so the session object always gets released (no more
	  memory leak) when the pjsip session is in a disconnected state. Except when
	  the method is a BYE. Then it waits until a transport error occurs or an event
	  timeout.

	* AST-2017-009: pjproject: Add validation of numeric header values

	  Parsing the numeric header fields like cseq, ttl, port, etc. all
	  had the potential to overflow, either causing unintended values to
	  be captured or, if the values were subsequently converted back to
	  strings, a buffer overrun.  To address this, new "strto" functions
	  have been created that do range checking and those functions are
	  used wherever possible in the parser.

	   * Created pjlib/include/limits.h and pjlib/include/compat/limits.h
	     to either include the system limits.h or define common numeric
	     limits if there is no system limits.h.

	   * Created strto*_validate functions in sip_parser that take bounds
	     and on failure call the on_str_parse_error function which prints
	     an error message and calls PJ_THROW.

	   * Updated sip_parser to validate the numeric fields.

	   * Fixed an issue in sip_transport that prevented error messages
	     from being properly displayed.

	   * Added "volatile" to some variables referenced in PJ_CATCH blocks
	     as the optimizer was sometimes optimizing them away.

	   * Fixed length calculation in sip_transaction/create_tsx_key_2543
	     to account for signed ints being 11 characters, not 9.

	* Fix ast_(v)asprintf() malloc failure usage conditions.

	  When (v)asprintf() fails, the state of the allocated buffer is undefined.
	  The library had better not leave an allocated buffer as a result or no one
	  will know to free it.  The most likely way it can return failure is for an
	  allocation failure.  If the printf conversion fails then you actually have
	  a threading problem which is much worse because another thread modified
	  the parameter values.

	  * Made __ast_asprintf()/__ast_vasprintf() set the returned buffer to NULL
	  on failure.  That is much more useful than either an uninitialized pointer
	  or a pointer that has already been freed.  Many uses won't have to check
	  for failure to ensure that the buffer won't be double freed or prevent an
	  attempt to free an uninitialized pointer.

	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream was setting "addr_type = STR_IP6" only
	  when an ipv6 media_address was specified on the endpoint.  If
	  rtp_ipv6 was set and ast_sip_get_host_ip_string returned an ipv6

	* res_pjsip_registrar.c: Update remove_existing AOR contact handling.

	  When "rewrite_contact" is enabled, the "max_contacts" count option can
	  block re-registrations because the source port from the endpoint can be
	  random.  When the re-registration is blocked, the endpoint may give up
	  re-registering and require manual intervention.

	  * The "remove_existing" option now allows a registration to succeed by
	  displacing any existing contacts that now exceed the "max_contacts" count.
	  Any removed contacts are the next to expire.  The behaviour change is
	  beneficial when "rewrite_contact" is enabled and "max_contacts" is greater
	  than one.  The removed contact is likely the old contact created by
	  "rewrite_contact" that the device is refreshing.

	* res_calendar_icalendar: Filter out occurrences superceded by another VEVENT

	  When we are loading the calendars, we call libical's
	  icalcomponent_foreach_recurrence method for each VEVENT component that
	  we have in our calendar.

	  That method has no knowledge concerning the existence of the other
	  VEVENT components and will feed our callback with all ocurrences
	  matching the requested time span.

	  The occurrences generated by icalcomponent_foreach_recurrence while
	  expanding a recurring VEVENT's RRULE and RDATE properties can be
	  superceded by an other VEVENT sharing the same UID.

	  I use an external iterator (in libical terminology) to avoid messing
	  with the internal ones from the calling function, and search for
	  VEVENTS which could supersede the current occurrence.

	  The event which can invalidate this occurence needs to have:

	  - the same UID as our recurrent component (comp)
	  - a RECURRENCE-ID property, which represents the start time of this
	    occurrence

	  If one component is found, just clean and return.

	* pjsip_message_filter: Fix regression causing bad contact address

	  The "res_pjsip:  Filter out non SIP(S) requests" commit moved the
	  filtering of messages to pjproject's PJSIP_MOD_PRIORITY_TRANSPORT_LAYER
	  in order to filter out incoming bad uri schemes as early as possible.
	  Since the change affected outgoing messages as well and the TRANSPORT
	  layer is the last to be run on outgoing messages, we were overwriting
	  the setting of external_signaling_address (which is set earlier by
	  res_pjsip_nat) with an internal address.

	  * pjsip_message_filter now registers itself as a pjproject module
	  twice.  Once in the TSX layer for the outgoing messages (as it was
	  originally), then a second time in the TRANSPORT layer for the
	  incoming messages to catch the invalid uri schemes.

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix bridge_p2p_rtp_write() reentrancy potential.

	  The bridge_p2p_rtp_write() has potential reentrancy problems.

	  * Accessing the bridged RTP members must be done with the instance1 lock
	  held.  The DTMF and asymmetric codec checks must be split to be done with
	  the correct RTP instance struct locked.  i.e., They must be done when
	  working on the appropriate side of the point to point bridge.

	  * Forcing the RTP mark bit was referencing the wrong side of the point to
	  point bridge.  The set mark bit is used everywhere else to set the mark
	  bit when sending not receiving.

	  The patches for ASTERISK_26745 and ASTERISK_27158 did not take into
	  account that not everything carried by RTP uses a codec.  The telephony
	  DTMF events are not exchanged with a codec.  As a result when
	  RFC2833/RFC4733 sent digits you would crash if "core set debug 1" is
	  enabled, the DTMF digits would always get passed to the core even though
	  the local native RTP bridge is active, and the DTMF digits would go out
	  using the wrong SSRC id.

	  * Add protection for non-format payload types like DTMF when updating the
	  lastrxformat and lasttxformat.  Also protect against non-format payload
	  types when checking for asymmetric codecs.

	* app_queue: Only do announcement logic between ringing cycles

	  This patch reverts the change by patch 2263 from old reviewboard.
	  Note that reverting that 2263-patch still preserves the behaviour that
	  the commit log of the 2263-patch claimed to add. The reason for this is:

	  The function wait_for_answer is only called from try_calling which
	  in turn is only called from the main for loop in queue_exec, and
	  earlier in that loop we already check the things that's removed by
	  this patch. There's no need to check those things twice each loop
	  iteration, and I think the proper place to check it is before each
	  ringing cycle. By checking it in wait_for_answer, you allow the issue
	  explained in the jira - that the head caller hears announcements while
	  the agents' sip phones are actively ringing.

	  Make strict RTP learning more flexible.

	  Direct media can cause strict RTP to attempt to learn a remote address
	  again before it has had a chance to learn the remote address the first

	  the first remote address and fail to latch onto the direct media remote
	  address.  As a result, you have one way audio until the call is placed on
	  and off hold.

	  The new algorithm learns remote addresses for a set time (1.5 seconds)
	  before locking the remote address.  In addition, we must see a configured
	  number of remote packets from the same address in a row before switching.

	  * Fixed strict RTP learning from always accepting the first new address
	  packet as the new stream.

	  * Fixed strict RTP to initialize the expected sequence number with the
	  last received sequence number instead of the last transmitted sequence
	  number.

	  with the voice-message counts from the message.

	  In 45744fc53, I mistakenly broke SDP media address rewriting by
	  misinterpreting which address was checked in the localnet comparison.

	  Instead of checking the remote peer address to decide whether we need
	  media address rewriting, we check our local media address: if it's
	  local, then we rewrite. This feels awkward, but works and even made
	  directmedia work properly if you set local_net. (For the record: for
	  local peers, the SDP media rewrite code is not called, so the
	  comparison does no harm there.)

	* chan_sip: Do not change IP address in SDP origin line (o=) in SIP reINVITE

	  If directmedia=yes is configured, when call is answered, Asterisk sends reINVITE
	  to both parties to set up media path directly between the endpoints.
	  In this reINVITE msg SDP origin line (o=) contains IP address of endpoint
	  instead of IP of asterisk. This behavior violates RFC3264, sec 8:
	  "When issuing an offer that modifies the session,
	  the "o=" line of the new SDP MUST be identical to that in the
	  previous SDP, except that the version in the origin field MUST
	  increment by one from the previous SDP."

	* res/res_pjsip: Standardize/fix localnet checks across pjsip.

	  In 2dee95cc (ASTERISK-27024) and 776ffd77 (ASTERISK-26879) there was
	  confusion about whether the transport_state->localnet ACL has ALLOW or
	  DENY semantics.

	  For the record: the localnet has DENY semantics, meaning that "not in
	  the list" means ALLOW, and the local nets are in the list.

	  Therefore, checks like this look wrong, but are right:

	      /* See if where we are sending this request is local or not, and if
	         not that we can get a Contact URI to modify */
	      if (ast_apply_ha(transport_state->localnet, &addr) != AST_SENSE_ALLOW) {
	          ast_debug(5, "Request is being sent to local address, "
	                       "skipping NAT manipulation\n");

	  (In the list == localnet == DENY == skip NAT manipulation.)

	  And conversely, other checks that looked right, were wrong.

	  This change adds two macro's to reduce the confusion and uses those
	  instead:

	      ast_sip_transport_is_nonlocal(transport_state, addr)
	      ast_sip_transport_is_local(transport_state, addr)

	* AST-2017-006: Fix app_minivm application MinivmNotify command injection

	  An admin can configure app_minivm with an externnotify program to be run
	  when a voicemail is received.  The app_minivm application MinivmNotify
	  uses ast_safe_system() for this purpose which is vulnerable to command
	  injection since the Caller-ID name and number values given to externnotify
	  can come from an external untrusted source.

	  * Add ast_safe_execvp() function.  This gives modules the ability to run
	  external commands with greater safety compared to ast_safe_system().
	  Specifically when some parameters are filled by untrusted sources the new
	  function does not allow malicious input to break argument encoding.  This
	  may be of particular concern where CALLERID(name) or CALLERID(num) may be
	  used as a parameter to a script run by ast_safe_system() which could
	  potentially allow arbitrary command execution.

	  * Changed app_minivm.c:run_externnotify() to use the new ast_safe_execvp()
	  instead of ast_safe_system() to avoid command injection.

	  * Document code injection potential from untrusted data sources for other
	  shell commands that are under user control.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Only learn a new source in learn state.

	  This change moves the logic which learns a new source address
	  for RTP so it only occurs in the learning state. The learning
	  state is entered on initial allocation of RTP or if we are
	  told that the remote address for the media has changed. While
	  in the learning state if we continue to receive media from
	  the original source we restart the learning process. It is
	  only once we receive a sufficient number of RTP packets from
	  the new source that we will switch to it. Once this is done
	  the closed state is entered where all packets that do not
	  originate from the expected source are dropped.

	  The learning process has also been improved to take into
	  account the time between received packets so a flood of them
	  while in the learning state does not cause media to be switched.

	  Finally RTCP now drops packets which are not for the learned
	  SSRC if strict RTP is enabled.

	* main/app: Only look to end of file if ':end' is specified, and not just ':'

	  There is a little known feature in app_controlplayback that will cause the

	  detected within the filename.

	  This feature is pretty bad, but okay.

	  However, a bug exists in this code where a ':' detected in the filename
	  will cause the end pointer to be non-NULL, even if the full ':end' isn't
	  specified. This causes us to treat an unspecified offset (0) as being
	  "start playing from the end of the file", resulting in no file playback
	  occurring.

	  found in the filename.

	* Fix downloader not working with curl

	  The codec/dpma downloader wasn't handling curl correctly.  The logic
	  that transforms makeopts into a bash-sourceable file wasn't
	  handling the make 'or' command in DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT so bash was
	  looking for an 'or' command.

	  That logic has been eliminated.  Instead of trying to transform
	  and source makeopts, the downloader now calls a make scriptlet
	  to print the value of a specific variable.  This way, make handles
	  the ors (or any other make construct that happens to creep into
	  that file).

	* res_pjsip: Remove ephemeral registered contacts on transport shutdown.

	  The fix for the issue is broken up into three parts.

	  This is part two which handles the server side of REGISTER requests when
	  rewrite_contact is enabled.  Any registered reliable transport contact
	  becomes invalid when the transport connection becomes disconnected.

	  * Monitor the rewrite_contact's reliable transport REGISTER contact for
	  shutdown.  If it is shutdown then the contact must be removed because it
	  is no longer valid.  Otherwise, when the client attempts to re-REGISTER it
	  may be blocked because the invalid contact is there.  Also if we try to
	  send a call to the endpoint using the invalid contact then the endpoint is
	  not likely to see the request.  The endpoint either won't be listening on
	  that port for new connections or a NAT/firewall will block it.

	  * Prune any rewrite_contact's registered reliable transport contacts on
	  boot.  The reliable transport no longer exists so the contact is invalid.

	  * Websockets always rewrite the REGISTER contact address and the transport
	  needs to be monitored for shutdown.

	  * Made the websocket transport set a unique name since that is what we use
	  as the ao2 container key.  Otherwise, we would not know which transport we
	  find when one of them shuts down.  The names are also used for PJPROJECT
	  debug logging.

	  * Made the websocket transport post the PJSIP_TP_STATE_CONNECTED state
	  event.  Now the global keep_alive_interval option, initially idle shutdown
	  timer, and the server REGISTER contact monitor can work on wetsocket
	  transports.

	  * Made the websocket transport set the PJSIP_TP_DIR_INCOMING direction.
	  Now initially idle websockets will automatically shutdown.

	  * Pull the management of PJPROJECT's transport state callback code from

	  tests/apps/voicemail/authenticate_invalid_password

	  The tests were noting the start of the vm-incorrect-mailbox prompt and
	  immediately sending the mailbox for the next login attempt.  Since the
	  invalid message playback had to complete before the digits were
	  recognized, the test passed for the wrong reason and added approximately
	  20 seconds to the test times.

	  * Allow the vm-incorrect-mailbox prompt to get interrupted by the mailbox
	  digits like the initial vm-login prompt so the tests are able to enter the
	  intended mailbox.

	* res_musiconhold:  Add kill_escalation_delay, kill_method to class

	  By default, when res_musiconhold reloads or unloads, it sends a HUP
	  signal to custom applications (and all descendants), waits 100ms,
	  then sends a TERM signal, waits 100ms, then finally sends a KILL
	  signal.  An application which is interacting with an external
	  device and/or spawns children of its own may not be able to exit
	  cleanly in the default times, expecially if sent a KILL signal, or
	  if it's children are getting signals directly from
	  res_musiconhoild.

	  * To allow extra time, the 'kill_escalation_delay'
	    class option can be used to set the number of milliseconds
	    res_musiconhold waits before escalating kill signals, with the
	    default being the current 100ms.

	  * To control to whom the signals are sent, the "kill_method" class
	    option can be set to "process_group" (the default, existing
	    behavior), which sends signals to the application and its
	    descendants directly, or "process" which sends signals only to the
	    application itself.

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix TURN deadlock by using ICE session group lock.

	  When a message is received on the TURN socket, the code processing the
	  message needs to call into the ICE/STUN session for further processing.
	  This code path locks the TURN group lock then the ICE/STUN group lock.  In
	  another thread an ICE/STUN timer can fire off to send a keep alive message
	  over the TURN socket.  In this code path, the ICE/STUN group lock is
	  obtained then the TURN group lock is obtained to send the packet.  A
	  classic deadlock case if the group locks are not the same.

	  * Made TURN get created using the ICE/STUN session's group lock.

	  NOTE: I was originally concerned that the ICE/STUN session can get
	  recreated by ice_reset_session() for an event like RTCP multiplexing
	  causing a change during SDP negotiation.  In this case the TURN group lock
	  would become different.  However, TURN is also recreated as part of the
	  ICE/STUN recreation in ice_create() when all known ICE candidates are
	  added to the new ICE session.  While the ICE/STUN and TURN sessions are
	  being recreated there is a period where the group locks could be
	  different.

	* pjsip_distributor.c: Fix deadlock with TCP type transports.

	  When a SIP message comes in on a transport, pjproject obtains the lock on
	  the transport and pulls the data out of the socket.  Unlike UDP, the TCP
	  transport does not allow concurrent access.  Without concurrency the
	  transport lock is not released when the transport's message complete
	  callback is called.  The processing continues and eventually Asterisk
	  starts processing the SIP message.  The first thing Asterisk tries to do
	  is determine the associated dialog of the message to determine the
	  associated serializer.  To get the associated serializer safely requires
	  us to get the dialog lock.

	  To send a request or response message for a dialog, pjproject obtains the
	  dialog lock and then obtains the transport lock.  Deadlock can result
	  because of the opposite order the locks are obtained.

	  * Fix the deadlock by obtaining the serializer associated with the dialog
	  another way that doesn't involve obtaining the dialog lock.  In this case,
	  we use an ao2 container to hold the associated endpoint and serializer.
	  The new locks are held a brief time and won't overlap other existing lock
	  times.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Fix issues with ICE renegotiation.

	  When re-inviting to add more streams it is possible for
	  the role of existing ICE sessions to be changed to the
	  incorrect value. This results in subsequent refreshes
	  within the sessions getting a role conflict and the ICE
	  session breaking down. This change only sets the role to
	  be the new value if an ICE renegotiation is actually
	  going to happen, otherwise the existing role is preserved.

	  As well if we encounter a situation where a unidirectional
	  ICE negotiation happens and the other side does not send us
	  candidates we will not store any information for sending
	  traffic, even though we know where they are reachable. This
	  change fixes this by using the source of the ICE traffic

	* res_pjsip_mwi: update unsolicited MWI subscriptions on updating contact

	  Do not need to unsubscribe/subscribe on creating the ednpoint's contact.
	  The modified function create_mwi_subscriptions_for_endpoint adds
	  the subscription only if it does not exist.

	  The subscriptions aren't added for active contacts
	  which are retrieved on startup from realtime
	  if mwi_disable_initial_unsolicited=yes.
	  Because the mwi_contact_added is not called.
	  So the subscriptions also should be created on updating contact.

	* core_local: local channel data not being properly unref'ed and unlocked

	  In an earlier version of Asterisk a local channel [un]lock all functions were
	  added in order to keep a crash from occurring when a channel hung up too early
	  during an attended transfer. Unfortunately, when a transfer failure occurs and
	  depending on the timing, the local channels sometime do not get properly
	  unlocked and deref'ed after being locked and ref'ed. This happens because the
	  underlying local channel structure gets NULLed out before unlocking.

	  This patch reworks those [un]lock functions and makes sure the values that get
	  locked and ref'ed later get unlocked and deref'ed.

	* res_corosync: Change thread stack size

	  In Corosync 2.x libraries were changed to use LibQB IPC.
	  Sadly LibQB IPC doesn't support copy-free access to received buffer, so
	  Corosync libraries were rewritten to use stack as buffer. Mostly the
	  needed stack size is quite small, but for all *_dispatch functions, 1MiB
	  is needed.

	  Asterisk function ast_pthread_create_background set stack size for new
	  thread to much smaller AST_BACKGROUND_STACKSIZE (~500KiB).

	  This results in Asterisk crash when running with Corosync 2.x.

	  Patch solves this issue by creating it's own version of
	  ast_pthread_create_background which sets stack size to much higher value
	  (actually it's AST_BACKGROUND_STACKSIZE + 3MiB).

	  Another problem may appear when "corosync show members" netconsole
	  command is executed. It is also executed in thread and also has only
	  500KiB stack size. Sadly it calls corosync_cfg_get_node_addrs which
	  again needs at least 1MiB stack.

	  Solution is to use HAVE_COROSYNC_CFG_STATE_TRACK as a discriminator
	  between Corosync 1.x and 2.x. If 1.x is found, nothing changes. If 2.x
	  is found, NodeID is displayed instead of IP address.

	  This patch creates a new CHECK_ARI_MODULE_LOADED macro which tests
	  to see if res_ari is actually loaded and causes the stubs to also
	  decline if it isn't.  The macro was then added to the mustache
	  template's "load_module" function.

	  The construction of the returned string assumed incorrectly that the

	* Core/PBX: Deadlock between dialplan execution and application unregistration.

	  Not easy to reproduce, but we have noticed deadlocks when unloading a module
	  while dialplan is handling a request.

	  The deadlock is between :
	  1) Dialplan execution: pbx_extension_helper() first taking conlock,
	  then pbx_findapp() [when called] asking for lock on apps list.
	  2) Application unregistration: ast_unregister_application() first taking lock
	  on apps list, then unreference_cached_app() [when called] asking for conlock.

	  As a protection, I suggest to modify ast_unregister_application(), so that it
	  anticipates the need of conlock, before taking the lock on apps list.
	  The side effect is a longer unavailability of conlock when unregistering an
	  application.

	* bridge: Add a deferred queue.

	  This change adds a deferred queue to bridging. If a bridge
	  technology determines that a frame can not be written and
	  should be deferred it can indicate back to bridging to do so.
	  Bridging will then requeue any deferred frames upon a new
	  channel joining the bridge.

	  This change has been leveraged for T.38 request negotiate
	  control frames. Without the deferred queue there is a race
	  condition between the bridge receiving the T.38 request
	  negotiate and the second channel joining and being in the
	  bridge. If the channel is not yet in the bridge then the T.38
	  negotiation fails.

	  A unit test has also been added that confirms that a T.38
	  request negotiate control frame is deferred when no other
	  channel is in the bridge and that it is requeued when a new
	  channel joins the bridge.

	* res_pjsip_refer/session: Calls dropped during transfer

	  When doing an attended transfer it's possible for the transferer, after
	  receiving an accepted response from Asterisk, to send a BYE to Asterisk,
	  which can then be processed before Asterisk has time to start and/or
	  complete the transfer process. This of course causes the transfer to not
	  complete successfully, thus dropping the call.

	  This patch makes it so any BYEs received from the transferer, after the REFER,
	  that initiate a session end are deferred until the transfer is complete. This
	  allows the channel that would have otherwise been hung up by Asterisk to
	  remain available throughout the transfer process.

	* pjsip: Extend 'asymmetric_rtp_codec' option to include us changing.

	  PJSIP support in Asterisk differs from chan_sip in that it
	  allows media to be sent as-is without transcoding provided
	  the codecs were negotiated in the SDP. This is allowed
	  according to the RFC. Support for this differs quite a lot
	  though and some endpoints do not handle it well.

	  This change extends the 'asymmetric_rtp_codec' option to
	  also cover this case. When set to no (the default) the code
	  behaves as chan_sip does - the best codec is selected and
	  we will only ever send that, unless we change what we are
	  sending if the remote side changes. When set to yes we
	  will send media as-is without transcoding if the codec
	  has been negotiated in the SDP.

	  Instead, use the same method as res_rtp_asterisk and 'predict' a
	  timestamp given the number of samples. If the difference between the
	  timestamp that we generate and the one we predict is within a specific
	  threshold, use the predicted timestamp so that we end up with timestamps
	  that are consistent with the number of samples we are actually sending.

	* channel: ast_write frame wrongly freed after call to audiohooks

	  ASTERISK-26419 introduced a bug when calling ast_audiohook_write_list in
	  ast_write. It would free the frame given to ast_write if the frame returned
	  by ast_audiohook_write_list was different than the given one. The frame
	  give to ast_write should never be freed within that function. It is the
	  caller's resposibility to free the frame after writing (or when it its done
	  with it). By freeing it within ast_write this of course led to some memory
	  corruption problems.

	  This patch makes it so the frame given to ast_write is no longer freed within
	  the function. The frame returned by ast_audiohook_write_list is now subsequently
	  used in ast_write and is freed later. It is freed either after translate if the
	  frame returned by translate is different, or near the end of ast_write prior
	  to function exit.

	* format: Reintroduce smoother flags

	  In review 4843 (ASTERISK-24858), we added a hack that forced a smoother
	  creation when sending signed linear so that the byte order was adjusted
	  during transmission. This was needed because smoother flags were lost
	  during the new format work that was done in Asterisk 13.

	  Rather than rolling that same hack into res_rtp_multicast, re-introduce
	  smoother flags so that formats can dictate their own options.

	* app_queue: Fix members showing as being in call when not.

	  A change was done which added an 'in_call' flag to queue
	  members that was set to true while talking to an agent.
	  Unfortunately in practice this does not accurately reflect
	  whether they are talking to an agent or not. If a Local
	  channel is involved and a transfer is performed then the
	  app_queue application would incorrectly think the agent
	  was still in a call with the caller. This was done to
	  fix a race condition between an agent becoming available
	  by device state and the checking of the last call information
	  for the wrapup time. There was a small window where the
	  last call information would be the previous value instead
	  of the new one.

	  This change goes about fixing the original issue in a
	  different way by considering the call completed if device
	  state is received which would make the agent available
	  and if they are currently in a call. If this occurs the
	  last call information is updated before the agent becomes
	  available ensuring that old information is not present
	  when checking if the member should be called. This also
	  improves the transfer situation by actually updating
	  and enforcing the wrapup time.

	* app_confbridge: Race between removing and playing name recording while leaving

	  When user leaves a conference, its channel calls async_play_sound_file()
	  in order to play the name announcement and then unlinks the sound file.
	  The async_play_sound_file() function adds a task to conference playback queue,
	  which then runs playback_common() function in a different thread.

	  It leads to a race condition when, in some cases, channel thread may unlink
	  the sound file before playback_common() had a chance to open it.

	  This patch creates a file deletion task, that is queued after playback.

	* app_queue: Fix duplicate queue_log entries for EXITEMPTY and ABANDON

	  There are 2 places in app_queue.c that log EXITEMPTY event: one in
	  wait_our_turn, and another one in queue_exec in the loop trying to
	  call an agent after wait_our_turn.

	  In most cases it leads to logging EXITEMPTY twice.

	  ABANDON is also logged on two places, and in the rare case when an agent
	  and caller hang up simultaneously it's also possible to get duplicates
	  in queue_log.

	  This commit changes wait_our_turn to return -1 ("the caller should exit
	  the queue") instead of 0 ("the caller's turn has arrived") in case of
	  leaving when empty, so queue_exec skips the agent calling loop.

	  Also, leave_queue is now executed only once in this case, because 2nd
	  time is just a noop when the queue entry has already been removed.

	  Also, it sets qe->handled to -1 to indicate that the call was not
	  answered by an agent, but the necessary handling has already been done
	  in order to avoid logging an extra ABANDON entry.

	* res_pjsip_session.c: Process initial INVITE sooner. (key exists)

	  Retransmissions of an initial INVITE could be queued in the serializer
	  before we have processed the first INVITE message.  If the first INVITE
	  message doesn't get completely processed before the retransmissions are
	  seen then we could try to setup the same call from the retransmissions.  A
	  symptom of this is seeing a (key exists) message associated with an
	  INVITE.  An earlier change attempted to address this kind of problem by
	  calculating a distributor serializer to use for unassociated messages.
	  Part of that change also made incoming calls keep using that distributor
	  serializer.  (ASTERISK-26088) However, some leftover code was still
	  deferring the INVITE processing to the session's serializer even though we
	  were already in that serializer.  This not only is unnecessary but would
	  cause the same call resetup problem.

	  * Removed the code to defer processing the initial INVITE to the session's
	  serializer because we are already running in that serializer.

	* cel_odbc:  Fix timestamp processing for microseconds

	  When a column is of type timestamp, the fraction part of the event
	  field's seconds was frequently parsed incorrectly especially if
	  there were leading zeros.  For instance "2017-05-23 23:55:03.023"
	  would be parsed into an int as "23" then when the timestamp was
	  formatted again to be inserted into the database column it'd be
	  "2017-05-23 23:55:03.23" which is now 230 milliseconds instead of
	  23 milliseconds.  "03.000001" would be transformed to "03.1", etc.

	  * If the event field is 'eventtime' and the db column is timestamp,
	    then existing processing has already correctly formatted the
	    timestamp so now we simply use it rather than parsing it and
	    re-printing it. This is the most common use case anyway.

	  * If the event field is other than 'eventtime' and the db column
	    is timestamp, we now parse the seconds, including the fractional
	    part into a double rather than 2 ints.  This preserves the
	    magnitude and precision of the fractional part.  When we print
	    it, we now print it as a "%09.6lf" which correctly represents the
	    input.

	  To be honest, why we parse the string timestamp into components,
	  test the components, then print the components back into a string
	  timestamp is beyond me.  We should use parse it, test it, then if
	  it passes, use the original string representation in the database
	  call.  Maybe someone thought that some implementations wouldn't
	  take a partial timestamp string like "2017-05-06" and decided to
	  always produce a full timestamp string even if an abbreviated one
	  was supplied.  Anyway, I'm leaving it as it is.

	* logger:  Added logger_queue_limit to the configuration options.

	  All log messages go to a queue serviced by a single thread
	  which does all the IO.  This setting controls how big that
	  queue can get (and therefore how much memory is allocated)
	  before new messages are discarded. The default is 1000.
	  Should something go bezerk and log tons of messages in a tight
	  loop, this will prevent memory escalation.

	  When the limit is reached, a WARNING is logged to that effect
	  and messages are discarded until the queue is empty again.  At
	  that time another WARNING will be logged with the count of
	  discarded messages.  There's no "low water mark" for this queue
	  because the logger thread empties the entire queue and processes it
	  in 1 batch before going back and waiting on the queue again.
	  Implementing a low water mark would mean additional locking as
	  the thread processes each message and it's not worth it.

	  A "test" was added to test_logger.c but since the outcome is
	  non-deterministic, it's really just a cli command, not a unit
	  test.

	* app_confbridge:  Fix reference to cfg in menu_template_handler

	  menu_template_handler wasn't properly accounting for the fact that
	  it might be called both during a load/reload (which isn't really
	  valid but not prevented) and by a dialplan function.  In both cases
	  it was attempting to use the "pending" config which wasn't valid in
	  the latter case.  aco_process_config is also partly to blame because
	  it wasn't properly cleaning "pending" up when a reload was done and
	  no changes were made.  Both of these contributed to a crash if
	  CONFBRIDGE(menu,template) was called in a dialplan after a reload.

	  * aco_process_config now sets info->internal->pending to NULL
	    after it unrefs it although this isn't strictly necessary in the
	    context of this fix.
	  * menu_template_handler now uses the "current" config and silently
	    ignores any attempt to be called as a result of someone uses the
	    "template" parameter in the conf file.

	  Luckily there's no other place in the codebase where
	  aco_pending_config is used outside of aco_process_config.

	* bridge: Fix returning to dialplan when executing Bridge() from AMI.

	  When using the Bridge AMI action on the same channel multiple times
	  it was possible for the channel to return to the wrong location in
	  the dialplan if the other party hung up. This happened because the
	  priority of the channel was not preserved across each action
	  invocation and it would fail to move on to the next priority in
	  other cases.

	  This change makes it so that the priority of a channel is preserved
	  when taking control of it from another thread and it is incremented
	  as appropriate such that the priority reflects where the channel
	  should next be executed in the dialplan, not where it may or may not
	  currently be.

	  The Bridge AMI action was also changed to ensure that it too
	  starts the channels at the next location in the dialplan.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Clearing the remote RTCP address causes RTCP failures

	  When a call gets put on hold RTP is temporarily stopped and Asterisk was
	  setting the remote RTCP address to NULL. Then when RTCP data was received
	  from the remote endpoint, Asterisk would be missing this information when
	  publishing the rtcp_message stasis event. Consequently, message subscribers
	  (in this case res_hep_rtcp) trying to parse the "from" field output the
	  following error:

	  "ast_sockaddr_split_hostport: Port missing in (null)"

	  This patch makes it so the remote RTCP address is no longer set to NULL when
	  stopping RTP. There was only one place that appeared to check if the remote
	  RTCP address was NULL as a way to tell if RTCP was running. This patch added
	  an additional check on the RTCP schedid for that case to make sure RTCP was
	  truly not running.

	* rtp_engine.c: Fix deadlock potential copying RTP payload maps.

	  There is a theoretical potential to deadlock in
	  ast_rtp_codecs_payloads_copy() because it locks two different
	  ast_rtp_codecs locks.  It is theoretical because the callers of the
	  function are either copying between a local ast_rtp_codecs struct and a
	  RTP instance of the ast_rtp_codecs struct.  Or they are copying between
	  the caller and callee channel RTP instances before initiating the call to
	  the callee.  Neither of these situations could actually result in a
	  deadlock because there cannot be another thread involved at the time.

	  * Add deadlock avoidance code to ast_rtp_codecs_payloads_copy() since it
	  locks two ast_rtp_codecs locks to perform a copy.

	* res_pjsip_t38.c: Fix deadlock in T.38 framehook.

	  A deadlock can happen between a channel lock and a pjsip session media

	  through the session's media container when it waits for the channel lock
	  to put the determined format capabilities onto the channel.  The other
	  thread is writing a frame to the channel and processing the T.38 frame
	  hook.  The T.38 frame hook then waits for the pjsip session's media
	  container lock.  The two threads are now deadlocked.

	  * Made the T.38 frame hook release the channel lock before searching the
	  session's media container.  This fix has been done to several other

	  If you use ast_request to create a PJSIP channel but then hang it
	  up without causing a transaction to be sent, the session will

	  that triggers the session cleanup when the transaction ends.
	  app_chanisavail was doing this to get more granular channel state
	  and it's also possible for this to happen via ARI.

	  * ast_sip_session_terminate was modified to explicitly call the
	    cleanup tasks and unreference session if the invite state is NULL
	    AND invite_tsx is NULL (meaning we never sent a transaction).

	  * chan_pjsip/hangup was modified to bump session before it calls
	    ast_sip_session_terminate to insure that session stays valid

	* frame: Better handle interpolated frames.

	  As well for users of ast_trans_frameout the function has
	  been changed to be a bit more sane and ensure that the data
	  pointer on a frame is set to NULL if no data is actually
	  on the frame. This allows the various spots in Asterisk that

	* core: Use eventfd for alert pipes on Linux when possible

	  The primary win of switching to eventfd when possible is that it only
	  uses a single file descriptor while pipe() will use two. This means for
	  each bridge channel we're reducing the number of required file
	  descriptors by 1, and - if you're using timerfd - we also now have 1
	  less file descriptor per Asterisk channel.

	  The API is not ideal (passing int arrays), but this is the cleanest
	  approach I could come up with to maintain API/ABI.

	  I've also removed what I believe to be an erroneous code block that
	  checked the non-blocking flag on the pipe ends for each read. If the
	  file descriptor is 'losing' its non-blocking mode, it is because of a
	  bug somewhere else in our code.

	  In my testing I haven't seen any measurable difference in performance.

	* rtp_engine/res_rtp_asterisk: Fix RTP struct reentrancy crashes.

	  The struct ast_rtp_instance has historically been indirectly protected
	  from reentrancy issues by the channel lock because early channel drivers
	  held the lock for really long times.  Holding the channel lock for such a
	  long time has caused many deadlock problems in the past.  Along comes
	  chan_pjsip/res_pjsip which doesn't necessarily hold the channel lock
	  because sometimes there may not be an associated channel created yet or
	  the channel pointer isn't available.

	  In the case of ASTERISK-26835 a pjsip serializer thread was processing a
	  message's SDP body while another thread was reading a RTP packet from the
	  socket.  Both threads wound up changing the rtp->rtcp->local_addr_str
	  string and interfering with each other.  The classic reentrancy problem
	  resulted in a crash.

	  In the case of ASTERISK-26853 a pjsip serializer thread was processing a
	  message's SDP body while another thread was reading a RTP packet from the

	  interfering with each other.  The classic reentrancy problem resulted in a

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Avoid deadlock when local RTP bridging in
	  bridge_p2p_rtp_write() because there are two RTP instance structs
	  involved.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Avoid deadlock when trying to stop scheduler
	  callbacks.  We cannot hold the instance lock when trying to stop a
	  scheduler callback.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Remove the lock in struct dtls_details and use the
	  struct ast_rtp_instance ao2 object lock instead.  The lock was used to
	  synchronize two threads to prevent a race condition between starting and
	  stopping a timeout timer.  The race condition is no longer present between
	  dtls_perform_handshake() and __rtp_recvfrom() because the instance lock
	  prevents these functions from overlapping each other with regards to the
	  timeout timer.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Remove the lock in struct ast_rtp and use the struct
	  ast_rtp_instance ao2 object lock instead.  The lock was used to
	  synchronize two threads using a condition signal to know when TURN
	  negotiations complete.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Avoid deadlock when trying to stop the TURN
	  ioqueue_worker_thread().  We cannot hold the instance lock when trying to
	  create or shut down the worker thread without a risk of deadlock.

	  This patch exposed a race condition between a PJSIP serializer thread
	  setting up an ICE session in ice_create() and another thread reading RTP
	  packets.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c:ice_create(): Set the new rtp->ice pointer after we
	  have re-locked the RTP instance to prevent the other thread from trying to
	  process ICE packets on an incomplete ICE session setup.

	  A similar race condition is between a PJSIP serializer thread resetting up
	  an ICE session in ice_create() and the timer_worker_thread() processing
	  the completion of the previous ICE session.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c:ast_rtp_on_ice_complete(): Protect against an
	  uninitialized/null remote_address after calling
	  update_address_with_ice_candidate().

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Eliminate the chance of ice_reset_session()
	  destroying and setting the rtp->ice pointer to NULL while other threads
	  are using it by adding an ao2 wrapper around the PJPROJECT ice pointer.
	  Now when we have to unlock the RTP instance object to call a PJPROJECT ICE
	  function we will hold a ref to the wrapper.  Also added some rtp->ice NULL
	  checks after we relock the RTP instance and have to do something with the
	  ICE structure.

	* res_stun_monitor: Don't fail to load if DNS resolution fails

	  res_stun_monitor will fail to load if DNS resolution of the STUN server
	  fails. Instead, we continue without the STUN server being resolved and
	  we will re-attempt the resolution on the STUN refresh interval.

	* modules:  change module LOAD_FAILUREs to LOAD_DECLINES

	  In all non-pbx modules, AST_MODULE_LOAD_FAILURE has been changed
	  to AST_MODULE_LOAD_DECLINE.  This prevents asterisk from exiting
	  if a module can't be loaded.  If the user wishes to retain the
	  FAILURE behavior for a specific module, they can use the "require"
	  or "preload-require" keyword in modules.conf.

	  A new API was added to logger: ast_is_logger_initialized().  This
	  allows asterisk.c/check_init() to print to the error log once the
	  logger subsystem is ready instead of just to stdout.  If something
	  does fail before the logger is initialized, we now print to stderr
	  instead of stdout.

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Add stun_blacklist option

	  Added the stun_blacklist option to rtp.conf.  Some multihomed servers have
	  IP interfaces that cannot reach the STUN server specified by stunaddr.
	  Blacklist those interface subnets from trying to send a STUN packet to
	  find the external IP address.  Attempting to send the STUN packet
	  needlessly delays processing incoming and outgoing SIP INVITEs because we
	  will wait for a response that can never come until we give up on the
	  response.  Multiple subnets may be listed.

	  * Fix poll timeout to keep track of the time when we sent the STUN
	  request.  We will now send a STUN request every three seconds regardless
	  of how many other packets we receive while waiting for a response until we
	  have completed three STUN request transmission cycles.

	  If DESTDIR is set, don't call ldconfig. Assume that DESTDIR is used to

	  has been removed as it was not completely accurate.  CentOS 64-bit
	  users should again specifiy --libdir=/usr/lib64 when configuring
	  to prevent install to /usr/lib.

	  Updated Makefile:check-old-libdir to check for orphans in
	  lib64 when installing to lib as well as orphans in lib when installing
	  to lib64.

	  Updated Makefile and main/Makefile uninstall targets to remove the
	  orphans using the new logic.

	* astobj2: Prevent potential deadlocks with ao2_global_obj_release

	  The ao2_global_obj_release() function holds an exclusive lock on the
	  global object while it is being dereferenced. Any destructors that
	  run during this time that call ao2_global_obj_ref() will deadlock
	  because a read lock is required.

	  Instead, we make the global object inaccessible inside of the write
	  lock and only dereference it once we have released the lock. This
	  allows the affected destructors to fail gracefully.

	  While this doesn't completely solve the referenced issue (the error
	  message about not being able to create an IQ continues to be shown)
	  it does solve the backtrace spew that accompanied it.

	* cel_pgsql.c: Fix buffer overflow calling libpq

	  Let's only allocate it to be as large as needed:
	  If we have a value, then (strlen(value) * 2) + 1 (as recommended
	  by libpq), and if we have none, just one byte to hold our null
	  will do.

	* pjproject_bundled: raise timeout value used when downloading

	  After configuring Asterisk with '--with-pjproject-bundled' the configure/build
	  process attempts to download pjproject from its download site. Currently, a
	  timeout of 10 seconds is used that will stop the download process if pjproject
	  has not been fully downloaded in that time. For some systems this was not enough
	  time and the process was timing out too early.

	  This patch raises the download timeout value to '60'. Also, this patch fixes
	  another bug where the DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT variable was not being properly exported
	  due to a naming error. DOWNLOAD_MAX_TIMEOUT is now properly renamed to
	  DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT.

	* res_xmpp: Correct implementation of JABBER_STATUS & JabberStatus

	  The documentation for JABBER_STATUS (and the deprecated JabberStatus
	  app) indicate that a return value of 7 indicates that the specified
	  buddy was not in the roster. It also indicates that you can specify a
	  "bare" JID (one without a resource). Unfortunately the actual behavior
	  does not match the documented behavior.

	  Assuming that our roster includes the buddy online and available
	  "valid@example.org/Valid" and does *not* include the buddy
	  "invalid@example.org", the JABBER_STATUS() function returns the
	  following before this patch:

	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | Buddy                        | Status     | Result                   |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | valid@example.org            |  Online    |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  | valid@example.org/Valid      |  Online    |  1 (Online)              |
	  | valid@example.org/Invalid    |  N/A       |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  | invalid@example.org          |  N/A       |  Error logged, no return |
	  | invalid@example.org/Valid    |  N/A       |  Error logged, no return |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+

	  And after this patch:

	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | Buddy                        | Status     | Result                   |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | valid@example.org            |  Online    |  1 (Online)              |
	  | valid@example.org/Valid      |  Online    |  1 (Online)              |
	  | valid@example.org/Invalid    |  N/A       |  6 (Offline)             |
	  | invalid@example.org          |  N/A       |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  | invalid@example.org/Valid    |  N/A       |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+

	  This brings the behavior in line with the documentation.

	* res_pjsip:  Symmetric transports

	  A new transport parameter 'symmetric_transport' has been added.

	  When a request from a dynamic contact comes in on a transport with
	  this option set to 'yes', the transport name will be saved and used
	  for subsequent outgoing requests like OPTIONS, NOTIFY and INVITE.
	  It's saved as a contact uri parameter named 'x-ast-txp' and will
	  display with the contact uri in CLI, AMI, and ARI output.  On the
	  outgoing request, if a transport wasn't explicitly set on the
	  endpoint AND the request URI is not a hostname, the saved transport
	  will be used and the 'x-ast-txp' parameter stripped from the
	  outgoing packet.

	  * config_transport was modified to accept and store the new parameter.

	  * config_transport/transport_apply was updated to store the transport
	    name in the pjsip_transport->info field using the pjsip_transport->pool
	    on UDP transports.

	  * A 'multihomed_on_rx_message' function was added to
	    pjsip_message_ip_updater that, for incoming requests, retrieves the
	    transport name from pjsip_transport->info and retrieves the transport.
	    If transport->symmetric_transport is set, an 'x-ast-txp' uri parameter
	    containing the transport name is added to the incoming Contact header.

	  * An 'ast_sip_get_transport_name' function was added to res_pjsip.
	    It takes an ast_sip_endpoint and a pjsip_sip_uri and returns a
	    transport name if endpoint->transport is set or if there's an
	    'x-ast-txp' parameter on the uri and the uri host is an ipv4 or
	    ipv6 address.  Otherwise it returns NULL.

	  * An 'ast_sip_dlg_set_transport' function was added to res_pjsip
	    which takes an ast_sip_endpoint, a pjsip_dialog, and an optional
	    pjsip_tpselector.  It calls ast_sip_get_transport_name() and if
	    a non-NULL is returned, sets the selector and sets the transport
	    on the dialog.  If a selector was passed in, it's updated.

	  * res_pjsip/ast_sip_create_dialog_uac and ast_sip_create_dialog_uas
	    were modified to call ast_sip_dlg_set_transport() instead of their
	    original logic.

	  * res_pjsip/create_out_of_dialog_request was modified to call
	    ast_sip_get_transport_name() and pjsip_tx_data_set_transport()
	    instead of its original logic.

	  * Existing transport logic was removed from endpt_send_request
	    since that can only be called after a create_out_of_dialog_request.

	  * res_pjsip/ast_sip_create_rdata was converted to a wrapper around
	    a new 'ast_sip_create_rdata_with_contact' function which allows
	    a contact_uri to be specified in addition to the existing
	    parameters.  (See below)

	  * res_pjsip_pubsub/internal_pjsip_evsub_send_request was eliminated
	    since all it did was transport selection and that is now done in
	    ast_sip_create_dialog_uac and ast_sip_create_dialog_uas.

	  * 'contact_uri' was added to subscription_persistence.  This was
	    necessary because although the parsed rdata contact header has the
	    x-ast-txp parameter added (if appropriate),
	    subscription_persistence_update stores the raw packet which
	    doesn't have it.  subscription_persistence_recreate was then
	    updated to call ast_sip_create_rdata_with_contact with the
	    persisted contact_uri so the recreated subscription has the
	    correct transport info to send the NOTIFYs.

	  * res_pjsip_session/internal_pjsip_inv_send_msg was eliminated since
	    all it did was transport selection and that is now done in
	    ast_sip_create_dialog_uac.

	  * pjsip_message_ip_updater/multihomed_on_tx_message was updated
	    to remove all traces of the x-ast-txp parameter from the
	    outgoing headers.

	  NOTE:  This change does NOT modify the behavior of permanent
	  contacts specified on an aor.  To do so would require that the
	  permanent contact's contact uri be updated with the x-ast-txp
	  parameter and the aor sorcery object updated.  If we need to
	  persue this, we need to think about cloning permanent contacts into
	  the same store as the dynamic ones on an aor load so they can be
	  updated without disturbing the originally configured value.

	  You CAN add the x-ast-txp parameter to a permanent contact's uri
	  but it would be much simpler to just set endpoint->transport.

	* autochan/mixmonitor/chanspy: Fix unsafe channel locking and references.

	  Dereferencing struct ast_autochan.chan without first calling
	  ast_autochan_channel_lock() is unsafe because the pointer could change at
	  any time due to a masquerade.  Unfortunately, ast_autochan_channel_lock()
	  itself uses struct ast_autochan.chan unsafely and can result in a deadlock
	  if the original channel happens to get destroyed after a masquerade in
	  addition to the pointer getting changed.

	  The problem is more likely to happen with v11 and earlier because
	  masquerades are used to optimize out local channels on those versions.
	  However, it could still happen on newer versions if the channel is
	  executing a dialplan application when the channel is transferred or
	  redirected.  In this situation a masquerade still must be used.

	  * Added a lock to struct ast_autochan to safely be able to use
	  ast_autochan.chan while trying to get the channel lock in
	  ast_autochan_channel_lock().  The locking order is the channel lock then
	  the autochan lock.  Locking in the other direction requires deadlock
	  avoidance.

	* Add rtcp-mux support

	  This commit adds support for RFC 5761: Multiplexing RTP Data and Control
	  Packets on a Single Port. Specifically, it enables the feature when
	  using chan_pjsip.

	  A new option, "rtcp_mux" has been added to endpoint configuration in
	  pjsip.conf. If set, then Asterisk will attempt to use rtcp-mux with
	  whatever it communicates with. Asterisk follows the rules set forth in
	  RFC 5761 with regards to falling back to standard RTCP behavior if the
	  far end does not indicate support for rtcp-mux.

	  The lion's share of the changes in this commit are in
	  res_rtp_asterisk.c. This is because it was pretty much hard wired to

	* app_queue: Handle the caller being redirected out of a queue bridge

	  A caller can leave the Queue() application after being bridged with a
	  member in a few ways:

	    * Caller or member hangup
	    * Caller is transferred somewhere else (blind or atx)
	    * Caller is externally redirected elsewhere

	  The first 2 scenarios are currently handled by subscribing to stasis
	  messages, but the 3rd is not explicitly covered. If a caller is
	  redirected away from the Queue() application, the member who was last
	  bridged with that caller will remain in an "In use" state until the
	  caller hangs up.

	  This patch adds handling of the caller leaving the queue via
	  redirection. We monitor the caller-member bridge, and if the caller is
	  the one that leaves, we treat it the same as we would a caller hangup.

	* pbx.c: Fix crash from malformed exten pattern.

	  Forgetting to indicate an exten is a pattern can cause a crash if the
	  "pattern" has a character set range.  e.g., "9999[3-5]" The crash is due
	  to a buffer overwrite because the '-' exten eye-candy wasn't removed as
	  expected and overran the allocated space.

	  The buffer overwrite is fixed two ways in this patch.

	  1) Fix ext_strncpy() to distinguish between pattern and non-pattern
	  extens.  Now '-' characters are removed when they are eye-candy and not
	  when they are part of a pattern character set.  Since the function is
	  private to pbx.c, the return value now returns the number of bytes written
	  to the destination buffer instead of the strlen() of the final buffer so
	  the callers that care don't need to add one.

	  2) Fix callers to ext_strncpy() to supply the correct available buffer
	  size of the destination buffer.

	* main/stasis_cache: Demote the ERROR message when removing a nonexistent item

	  This patch demotes the ERROR message that is displayed when a
	  nonexistent item is removed from the Stasis cache. The genesis of this
	  demotion is due to chan_sip's realtime peers and their interaction with
	  Asterisk's core ast_endpoint code, but ostensibly it could happen from
	  other channel drivers as well.

	  Since Mark Michelson already did an excellent job of explaining on this
	  issue, it is quoted here for posterity:

	  "Internally, when a realtime peer is retrieved, Asterisk creates an
	  ast_endpoint structure. When that peer is destroyed, the ast_endpoint is
	  destroyed as well. Part of the destruction of the ast_endpoint involves
	  clearing the Stasis cache of all information about that endpoint. The
	  problem here is that the act of creating the ast_endpoint is not enough
	  to actually put any information in the Stasis cache. Instead, something
	  has to happen, such as a state change, in order for the Stasis cache to
	  have any information about that endpoint. When a device registers,
	  chan_sip creates an ast_endpoint structure, processes the REGISTER, and
	  then destroys the ast_endpoint. When the ast_endpoint is destroyed,
	  there is nothing to destroy in the Stasis cache, so an error message is
	  emitted. When you use rtcachefriends, ast_endpoint structures persist
	  for the lifetime of the module and so you do not see this error
	  message."

	* menuselect: Add a new 'options' support type

	  The Binaural Rendering patches in the master branch required
	  menuselect to be updated with a new support type called 'option'.
	  This allows binaural rendering to be turned on or off when
	  bridge_softmix is built.  This patch backports the 'option'
	  functionality to the 13 and 14 branches.

	  Here's what it looks like in menuselect:

	    [*] bridge_simple
	    [*] bridge_softmix
	        --- Module Options ---
	    [ ] binaural_rendering_in_bridge_softmix

	  To create an option for a module, you can create (or update) the
	  menuselect-tree xml snippet in the directory where the module
	  resides and add a member element with an 'option' support_level.

	  Example (abbreviated) from bridges/bridges.xml:

	  <member name="binaural_rendering_in_bridge_softmix"
	  	displayname="Enable binaural rendering in bridge_softmix"
	  	remove_on_change="bridges/bridge_softmix.o bridges/bridge_softmix.so">
	  	<support_level>option</support_level>
	  	<depend>bridge_softmix</depend>
	  	<depend>fftw3</depend>
	  	<defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	  </member>

	  The 'name' will be added or removed from the MENUSELECT_<dir>
	  make variable following the standard module "missing means yes"
	  rules.

	  Example (abbreviated) from bridges/Makefile:

	  ifeq ($(findstring binaural_rendering,$(MENUSELECT_BRIDGES)),)
	  bridge_softmix.o: _ASTCFLAGS+=-DBINAURAL_RENDERING
	  bridge_softmix.so: LIBS+=$(FFTW3_LIB)

	  libasteriskssl.so not being found, as it is not in the multiarch
	  lib directory.  To make matters worse, options were being passed
	  to ldconfig on both Linux and FreeBSD that actually prevented
	  the rebuild of the cache.

	   * Fedora has a /usr/share/config.site that automatically tells
	     autoconf to use /usr/lib64 but CentOS does not. This logic was
	     copied to configure.ac and modified so systems like Ubuntu,
	     which still use /usr/lib for 64-bit systems, aren't affected.

	  Now that we have them in the correct directory...

	  In order for the system loader to find libasteriskssl and
	  libasteriskpj, one of 3 things has to happen...

	    - The linker cache must be rebuilt including the directory
	      where the libasterisk* libraries were installed.  Only root
	      can rebuild the cache.  This was busted.
	    - We have to link the asterisk binary with an rpath pointing
	      to the directrory where the libasterisk* libraries were
	      installed.  This makes things very complicated and will happen
	      over the collective dead bodies of everyone who's had to
	      package a distribution with an rpath.
	    - Finally, you can start asterisk with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the
	      directrory where the libasterisk* libraries were installed.

	  There are no other options. So...

	   * The invokation of ldconfig has been moved from main/Makefile
	     to ASTTOPDIR/Makefile, the options have been removed, and
	     DESTDIR/ASTLIBDIR appended.  If you aren't root, you will be
	     warned after the "Asterisk Installation Compete" banner that
	     you must re-run 'make install' as root, manually run
	     'ldconfig DESTDIR/ASTLIBDIR' as root, or run asterisk with
	     LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

	* build_tools:  Fix download_externals to allow the use of curl or wget

	  Not sure if this is really a bug versus an improvement. I can see it being

	  The current build_tools/download_externals file depends on wget in order to
	  download external modules.  The current build system is able to discover
	  which tool to use for fetching remote files - either wget or curl.

	  This patch takes advantage of this capability by modifying the two calls to
	  the wget binary to instead use what was discovered by the build system.

	* res_pjsip_authenticator_digest.c: Fix sorcery's immutable contract violation.

	  The inbound authentication object is supposed to be immutable when it is
	  stored in sorcery.  However, the immutable property is violated if the
	  authentication object does not have a realm set.

	  The immutable contract violation has a different effect depending upon
	  what sorcery back end is used.  If it is the config file back end you
	  would get the same object back until res_pjsip is reloaded.  If it is the
	  real-time or AstDB back end you would get a new object on each query.  If
	  it is cached you would get the same object back until it is refreshed from
	  the database.

	  Once an inbound authentication object has its realm set it may or may not
	  get updated again if the default_realm changes.

	  If the same authentication object is used for inbound and outbound
	  authentication then the immutable violation can make it very hard to
	  determine why the outbound authentication now fails.  The only diagnostic
	  message is a complaint about no realms matching when it had worked
	  earlier.  It fails because of the difference in behaviour for an empty
	  realm setting between inbound and outbound authentication objects.

	  * Fixed the sorcery object immutable violation by creating a new object
	  and setting the default_realm on it instead.  The new object is a shallow
	  copy for speed.

	  * The auth_store thread storage no longer holds an auth ref.  It
	  interferes with the shallow copy and never needed a ref anyway.

	* res_pjsip: Record the serializer earlier on the tdata.

	  When PJPROJECT needs to do a DNS resolution and there is not a cached
	  entry available, the SIP request message goes out on the PJSIP monitor
	  thread instead of the original serializer thread.  Thus when the response
	  comes back it does not get processed by the original sending serializer.

	  This patch records the serializer on tdata before passing a request
	  message to PJPROJECT where it can in Asterisk code.  There are several
	  places in PJPROJECT for outbound registration and publishing support that
	  would need to record the serializer.  Unfortunately, without replacing the
	  PJPROJECT DNS resolver as was done in v14 we cannot fix those without
	  modifying PJPROJECT.

	  Even if we backported the DNS resolver from v14, the outbound registration
	  refresh timer does not go out on a serializer thread but the PJSIP monitor
	  thread.  Fortunately, Asterisk's outbound publish support doesn't use the
	  auto refresh timer that would also not go out under the serializer thread.

	  This patch is v13 only.

	* realtime: Fix LIKE escaping in SQL backends

	  The realtime framework allows for components to look up values using a
	  LIKE clause with similar syntax to SQL's. pbx_realtime uses this
	  functionality to search for pattern matching extensions that start with
	  an underscore (_).

	  When passing an underscore to SQL's LIKE clause, it will be interpreted
	  as a wildcard matching a single character and therefore needs to be
	  escaped. It is (for better or for worse) the responsibility of the
	  component that is querying realtime to escape it with a backslash before
	  passing it in. Some RDBMs support escape characters by default, but the
	  SQL92 standard explicitly says that there are no escape characters
	  unless they are specified with an ESCAPE clause, e.g.

	  	SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '\_%' ESCAPE '\'

	  This patch instructs 3 backends - res_config_mysql, res_config_pgsql,
	  and res_config_sqlite3 - to use the ESCAPE clause where appropriate.

	  Looking through documentation and source tarballs, I was able to
	  determine that the ESCAPE clause is supported in:

	  MySQL 5.0.15   (released 2005-10-22 - earliest version available from
	                  archives)
	  PostgreSQL 7.1 (released 2001-04-13)
	  SQLite 3.1.0   (released 2005-01-21)

	  The versions of the relevant libraries that we depend on to access MySQL
	  and PostgreSQL will not work on versions that old, and I've added an
	  explicit check in res_config_sqlite3 to only use the ESCAPE clause when
	  we have a sufficiently new version of SQLite3.

	  res_config_odbc already handles the escape characters appropriately, so
	  no changes were required there.

	* res_config_sqlite3: Properly create missing columns when necessary

	  There were two specific issues resolved here:

	  1) The code that iterated over the required fields

	  2) sqlite3_changes() was used to try and count the number of rows
	     returned by a SELECT statement. sqlite3_changes() only counts
	     affected rows, so this was always returning the value from the
	     most recent data modification statement. We now separate read-only

	* chan_unistim: fix char type to have consistent behavior on ARM

	  There is difference exists in behaviour of char type on x86 and ARM.
	  On x86 by default char variable type means signed char, but in ARM
	  unsigned char used. This make binary calculations and negative values
	  works wrong on ARM.

	  This patch change type of char variables used for store negative
	  values and binary calculations to signed char.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub:  Correctly implement persisted subscriptions

	  This patch fixes 2 original issues and more that those 2 exposed.

	  * When we send a NOTIFY, and the client either doesn't respond or
	    responds with a non OK, pjproject only calls our
	    pubsub_on_evsub_state callback, no others.  Since
	    pubsub_on_evsub_state (which does the sub_tree cleanup) does not
	    expect to be called back without the other callbacks being called
	    first, it just returns leaving the sub_tree orphaned.  Now
	    pubsub_on_evsub_state checks the event for PJSIP_EVENT_TSX_STATE
	    which is what pjproject will set to tell us that it was the
	    transaction that timed out or failed and not the subscription
	    itself timing our or being terminated by the client. If is
	    TSX_STATE, pubsub_on_evsub_state now does the proper cleanup
	    regardless of the state of the subscription.

	  * When a client renews a subscription, we don't update the
	    persisted subscription with the new expires timestamp.  This causes
	    subscription_persistence_recreate to prune the subscription if/when
	    asterisk restarts.  Now, pubsub_on_rx_refresh calls
	    subscription_persistence_update to apply the new expires timestamp.
	    This exposed other issues however...

	  * When creating a dialog from rdata (which sub_persistence_recreate
	    does from the packet buffer) there must NOT be a tag on the To
	    header (which there will be when a client refreshes a
	    subscription).  If there is one, pjsip_dlg_create_uas will fail.
	    To address this, subscription_persistence_update now accepts a flag
	    that indicates that the original packet buffer must not be updated.
	    New subscribes don't set the flag and renews do.  This makes sure
	    that when the rdata is recreated on asterisk startup, it's done
	    from the original subscribe packet which won't have the tag on To.

	  * When creating a dialog from rdata, we were setting the dialog's
	    remote (SUBSCRIBE) cseq to be the same as the local (NOTIFY) cseq.
	    When the client tried to resubscribe after a restart with the
	    correct cseq, we'd reject the request with an Invalid CSeq error.

	  * The acts of creating a dialog and evsub by themselves when
	    recreating a subscription does NOT restart pjproject's subscription
	    timer.  The result was that even if we did correctly recreate the
	    subscription, we never removed it if the client happened to go away
	    or send a non-OK response to a NOTIFY.  However, there is no
	    pjproject function exposed to just set the timer on an evsub that
	    wasn't created by an incoming subscribe request.  To address this,
	    we create our own timer using ast_sip_schedule_task.  This timer is
	    used only for re-establishing subscriptions after a restart.

	    An earlier approach was to add support for setting pjproject's
	    timer (via a pjproject patch) and while that patch is still included
	    here, we don't use that call at the moment.

	  While addressing these issues, additional debugging was added and
	  some existing messages made more useful.  A few formatting changes
	  were also made to 'pjsip show scheduled tasks' to make displaying
	  the subscription timers a little more friendly.

	  pjsip limits the total number of ICE candidates to PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND,
	  which is a compile-time constant. Instead of hard-coding 16 when we
	  enumerate local interfaces, use PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND so that we can
	  potentially collect more interfaces if the compile time options are

	* Update qualifies when AOR configuration changes.

	  Prior to this change, qualifies would only update in the following
	  cases:
	  * A reload of res_pjsip.so was issued.
	  * A dynamic contact was re-registered after its AOR's qualify_frequency
	    had been changed
	  This does not work well if you are using realtime for your AORs. You can
	  update your database to have a new qualify_frequency, but the permanent
	  contacts on that AOR will not have their qualifies updated. And the
	  dynamic contacts on that AOR will not have their qualifies updated until
	  the next registration, which could be a long time.

	  This change seeks to fix this problem by making it so that whenever AOR
	  configuration is applied, the contacts pertaining to that AOR have their
	  qualifies updated.

	  Additions from this patch:
	  * AOR sorcery objects now have an apply handler that calls into a newly
	    added function in the OPTIONS code. This causes all contacts
	    associated with that AOR to re-schedule qualifies.
	  * When it is time to qualify a contact, the OPTIONS code checks to see
	    if the AOR can still be retrieved. If not, then qualification is
	    canceled on the contact.

	  Alterations from this patch:
	  * The registrar code no longer updates contact's qualify_frequence and
	    qualify_timeout. There is no point to this since those values already
	    get updated when the AOR changes.
	  * Reloading res_pjsip.so no longer calls the OPTIONS initialization
	    function. Reloading res_pjsip.so results in re-loading AORs, which
	    results in re-scheduling qualifies.

	* channel.c: Fix unbalanced read queue deadlocking local channels.

	  Using the timerfd timing module can cause channel freezing, lingering, or
	  deadlock issues.  The problem is because this is the only timing module
	  that uses an associated alert-pipe.  When the alert-pipe becomes
	  unbalanced with respect to the number of frames in the read queue bad
	  things can happen.  If the alert-pipe has fewer alerts queued than the
	  read queue then nothing might wake up the thread to handle received frames
	  from the channel driver.  For local channels this is the only way to wake
	  up the thread to handle received frames.  Being unbalanced in the other
	  direction is less of an issue as it will cause unnecessary reads into the
	  channel driver.

	  ASTERISK-26716 is an example of this deadlock which was indirectly fixed
	  by the change that found the need for this patch.

	  * In channel.c:__ast_queue_frame(): Adding frame lists to the read queue
	  did not add the same number of alerts to the alert-pipe.  Correspondingly,
	  when there is an exceptionally long queue event, any removed frames did
	  not also remove the corresponding number of alerts from the alert-pipe.

	  A dialplan intercept routine is equivalent to an interrupt routine.  As

	* Frame deferral: Revert API refactoring.

	  There are several issues with deferring frames that are caused by the
	  refactoring.

	  1) The code deferring frames mishandles adding a deferred frame to the
	  deferred queue.  As a result the deferred queue can only be one frame
	  long.

	  2) Deferrable frames can come directly from the channel driver as well as
	  the read queue.  These frames need to be added to the deferred queue.

	  3) Whoever is deferring frames is really only doing the __ast_read() to
	  collect deferred frames and doesn't care about the returned frames except
	  to detect a hangup event.  When frame deferral is completed we must make
	  the normal frame processing see the hangup as a frame anyway.  As such,
	  there is no need to have varying hangup frame deferral methods.  We also
	  need to be aware of the AST_SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO hangup that isn't real.
	  That fake hangup is to cause the PBX thread to break out of loops to go
	  execute a new dialplan location.

	  4) To properly deal with deferrable frames from the channel driver as
	  pointed out by (2) above, means that it is possible to process a dialplan
	  interception routine while frames are deferred because of the
	  AST_CONTROL_READ_ACTION control frame.  Deferring frames is not
	  implemented as a re-entrant operation so you could have the unsupported
	  case of two sections of code thinking they have control of the media
	  stream.

	  A worse problem is because of the bad implementation of the AMI PlayDTMF

	* res_pjsip: Handle invocation of callback on outgoing request when error occurs.

	  There are some error cases in PJSIP when sending a request that will
	  result in the callback for the request being invoked.  The code did not
	  handle this case and assumed on every error case that the callback was not
	  invoked.

	  The code has been changed to check whether the callback has been invoked
	  and if so to absorb the error and treat it as a success.

	* debug_utilities:  Add ast_logescalator

	  The escalator works by creating a set of startup commands in cli.conf
	  that set up logger channels and issue the debug commands for the
	  subsystems specified.  If asterisk is running when it is executed,
	  the same commands will be issued to the running instance.  The original
	  cli.conf is saved before any changes are made and can be restored by
	  executing '$prog --reset'.

	  The log output will be stored in...
	  $astlogdir/message.$uniqueid
	  $astlogdir/debug.$uniqueid
	  $astlogdir/dtmf.$uniqueid
	  $astlogdir/fax.$uniqueid
	  $astlogdir/security.$uniqueid

	  Some minor tweaks were made to chan_sip, and res_pjsip_history
	  so their history output could be send to a log channel as packets
	  are captured.

	  A minor tweak was also made to manager so events are output to verbose
	  when "manager set debug on" is issued.

	* app_queue: Fix queues randomly disappearing on reload

	  With 500+ queues and a reload every minute, a random queue disappears
	  upon reload. The cause is mususe of the 'dead' flag. Namely, all queues
	  were marked dead up front, and then "resurrected" by dropping this flag
	  for those found in the configuration. But a queue marked dead can be
	  removed also when control leaves the app entry point on a PBX thread.

	  With this change, the queue is marked only not found, and at the end of
	  reload only the queues that are still not found are actually marked as
	  dead, so the dead flag is never reset, and set only on positively dead
	  queues.

	* Add reload options to CLI/AMI stale object commands.

	  Marking an object as stale in a memory cache is supposed to prime the
	  cache so that the next time the item is retrieved, the stale item is
	  deleted from the cache and a background task is run to re-populate the
	  cache with a fresh version of the object.

	  The problem is, there are some object types out there for which there is
	  no natural reason that they would be retrieved from the backend with any
	  regularity. Outbound PJSIP registrations are a good example of this. At
	  startup, they are read, and an object-specific state is created that
	  refers to the initially-retrieved object for all time.

	  Adding the "reload" option to the CLI/AMI commands gives the cache the
	  opportunity to manually re-retrieve the object from the backend, both
	  storing the new object in the cache and applying the new object's
	  configuration to the module that uses that object.

	* ari: Implement 'debug all' and request/response logging

	  The 'ari set debug' command has been enhanced to accept 'all' as an
	  application name.  This allows dumping of all apps even if an app
	  hasn't registered yet.  To accomplish this, a new global_debug global
	  variable was added to res/stasis/app.c and new APIs were added to
	  set and query the value.

	  'ari set debug' now displays requests and responses as well as events.
	  This required refactoring the existing debug code.

	  * The implementation for 'ari set debug' was moved from stasis/cli.{c,h}
	    to ari/cli.{c,h}, and stasis/cli.{c,h} were deleted.
	  * In order to print the body of incoming requests even if a request
	    failed, the consumption of the body was moved from the ari stubs
	    to ast_ari_callback in res_ari.c and the moustache templates were
	    then regenerated.  The body is now passed to ast_ari_invoke and then
	    on to the handlers.  This results in code savings since that template
	    was inserted multiple times into all the stubs.

	  An additional change was made to the ao2_str_container implementation
	  to add partial key searching and a sort function.  The existing cli
	  code assumed it was already there when it wasn't so the tab completion
	  was never working.

	* PJPROJECT logging: Fix detection of max supported log level.

	  The mechanism used for detecting the maximum log level compiled into the
	  linked pjproject did not work.  The API call simply stores the requested
	  level into an integer and does no range checking.  Asterisk was assuming
	  that there was range checking and limited the new value to the allowable
	  range.  To get the actual maximum log level compiled into the linked
	  pjproject we need to get and save off the initial set log level from
	  pjproject.  This is the maximum log level supported.

	  * Get and save off the initial log level setting before altering it to the
	  desired level on startup.  This has to be done by a macro rather than
	  calling a core function to avoid incorrectly linking pjproject.

	  * Split the initial log level warning messages to warn if the linked
	  pjproject cannot support the requested startup level and if it is too low
	  to get the pjproject buildopts for "pjproject show buildopts".

	  * Adjust the CLI "pjproject set log level" to check the saved max log
	  level and to generate normal output messages instead of a warning message.

	* abstract/fixed/adpative jitter buffer: disallow frame re-inserts

	  It was possible for a frame to be re-inserted into a jitter buffer after it
	  had been removed from it. A case when this happened was if a frame was read
	  out of the jitterbuffer, passed to the translation core, and then multiple
	  frames were returned from said translation core. Upon multiple frames being
	  returned the first is passed on, but sebsequently "chained" frames are put
	  back into the read queue. Thus it was possible for a frame to go back into
	  the jitter buffer where this would cause problems.

	  This patch adds a flag to frames that are inserted into the channel's read
	  queue after translation. The abstract jitter buffer code then checks for this
	  flag and ignores any frames marked as such.

	* debug_utilities:  Create the ast_coredumper utility

	  This utility allows easy manipulation of asterisk coredumps.

	  * Configurable search paths and patterns for existing coredumps
	  * Can generate a consistent coredump from the running instance
	  * Can dump the lock_infos table from a coredump
	  * Dumps backtraces to separate files...
	    - thread apply 1 bt full -> <coredump>.thread1.txt
	    - thread apply all bt -> <coredump>.brief.txt
	    - thread apply all bt full -> <coredump>.full.txt
	    - lock_infos table -> <coredump>.locks.txt
	  * Can tarball corefiles and optionally delete them after processing
	  * Can tarball results files and optionally delete them after processing
	  * Converts ':' in coredump and results file names '-' to facilitate
	    uploading.  Jira for instance, won't accept file names with colons
	    in them.

	  Tested on Fedora24+, Ubuntu14+, Debian6+, CentOS6+ and FreeBSD9+[1].

	  [1] For *BSDs, the "devel/gdb" package might have to be installed to
	  get a recent gdb.  The utility will check all instances of gdb
	  it finds in $PATH and if one isn't found that can run python, it
	  prints a friendly error.

	* res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip: Add support for SRV lookups.

	  This change implements SRV support for the IP based endpoint
	  identifier module. All possible addresses through SRV are looked
	  up and added as matches. If no SRV records are available a
	  fallback to normal host resolution is done. If an IP address
	  is provided then no SRV lookup occurs.

	  This is configured using the "srv_lookups" option on the
	  identify section and defaults to "yes".

	* res_pjsip_session: Access SIPDOMAIN via Dialplan.

	  This feature was available in the SIP channel driver chan_sip. For example,
	  Asterisk is the outbound proxy and has to handle all SIP-URIs, even domains not
	  local to Asterisk. In that case, SIPDOMAIN is used in the Dialplan, to detect
	  and dial remote SIP-URIs. This change here sets the SIP destination domain of
	  an inbound call (SIPDOMAIN) in the SIP channel driver res_pjsip as well.

	* chan_sip: Remember SDP negotiation on SIP_CODEC_INBOUND.

	  After a SIP_CODEC_INBOUND in the dialplan, do not continue with cached formats
	  but remember the joint format. Cached formats contain default parameters,
	  often create an empty fmtp line. However, a joint format might have passed
	  format_get_joint(.) in a res_format_attr_* module (like Opus Codec) and
	  contain the resulting format parameters from a SDP negotiation.

	* pjproject_bundled:  Compile pjsua with max log level = 2

	  A while back, we changed config_site.h to set PJ_LOG_MAX_LEVEL = 6.
	  This allowed us to control the log level better from inside Asterisk.
	  An unfortunate side effect of this was that the pjsua binary and
	  python bindings were also compiled with log level set to 6 so whenever
	  a testsuite test that uses pjsua runs, it spits out 6795 lines of
	  debug in an instant even before the test starts.  I believe this
	  overruns the Jenkins capture buffer and prevents the test from
	  properly terminating.  In turn, this results in the testsuite just
	  hanging until the job is killed.  It's more frequent on the higher
	  end agents because they can spit out the messages faster.

	  Unfortunately, the messages are all spit out before we have control
	  of the python pj.Lib instance where we can set logging levels so the
	  only alternative was to actually compile pjsua and _pjsua.so with an
	  overridden PJ_LOG_MAX_LEVEL.  Although defining a lower max level was
	  done in the Makefile, the define in config_site.h had to be wrapped
	  with "#ifndef" so the change would take effect.

	* chan_pjsip: Use session for retrieving CHANNEL() information.

	  The CHANNEL() dialplan function implementation for PJSIP allows
	  querying of PJSIP specific information. This used the channel
	  passed in to get the PJSIP session and associated information.
	  It is possible for this channel to be masqueraded and end
	  up as a different channel type by the time the information
	  request is actually acted upon.

	  This change retrieves the PJSIP session safely and accesses
	  data from it (including channel). This provides a guarantee
	  that the session and channel will not be altered when the
	  request is being acted upon.

	* bridge_native_rtp.c: Fix native rtp bridge data race.

	  native_rtp_bridge_compatible() didn't lock the bridge channels before
	  checking the channels for native bridging ability.  As a result, one of
	  the channel's native format capabilities structure got replaced out from
	  under the native bridge check.  Use of a stale pointer to freed memory
	  causes bad things to happen.

	  tests/channels/pjsip/transfers/blind_transfer/caller_direct_media
	  testsuite test caught this.

	  2) Signal threads to stop
	  3) Clear config based tables (but do not free the table itself).
	  4) Verify that threads have shutdown, cancel unload if not.
	  5) Clean all remaining resources.

	* chan_sip: Do not allow non-SP/HTAB between header key and colon.

	  RFC says SIP headers look like:

	      HCOLON  =  *( SP / HTAB ) ":" SWS
	      SWS     =  [LWS]                    ; sep whitespace
	      LWS     =  [*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP        ; linear whitespace
	      WSP     =  SP / HTAB                ; from rfc2234

	  chan_sip implemented this:

	      HCOLON  =  *( LOWCTL / SP ) ":" SWS
	      LOWCTL  = %x00-1F                   ; CTL without DEL

	  This discrepancy meant that SIP proxies in front of Asterisk with
	  chan_sip could pass on unknown headers with \x00-\x1F in them, which
	  would be treated by Asterisk as a different (known) header.  For
	  example, the "To\x01:" header would gladly be forwarded by some proxies
	  as irrelevant, but chan_sip would treat it as the relevant "To:" header.

	  Those relying on a SIP proxy to scrub certain headers could mistakenly
	  get unexpected and unvalidated data fed to Asterisk.

	  This change fixes so chan_sip only considers SP/HTAB as valid tokens
	  before the colon, making it agree on the headers with other speakers of
	  SIP.

	* Bundled pjproject:  Fix finding SIP transactions.

	  Occasionally SIP message transactions are not found when they should be.
	  In the particular case an incoming INVITE transaction is CANCELed but the
	  INVITE transaction cannot be found so a 481 response is returned for the
	  CANCEL.  The problematic calls have a '_' character in the Via branch
	  parameter.

	  The problem is in the pjproject PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER feature's code.
	  The problem with the "own tolower" code is that it does not calculate the
	  same hash value as when the pj_tolower() function is used.  The "own
	  tolower" code will erroneously modify the ASCII characters '@', '[', '\\',
	  ']', '^', and '_'.  Calls to pj_hash_calc_tolower() can use the
	  PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER substitute algorithm when enabled.  Calls to
	  pj_hash_get_lower(), pj_hash_set_lower(), and pj_hash_set_np_lower() call
	  find_entry() which never uses the PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER algorithm.  As a
	  result you may not be able to find a hash tabled entry because the
	  calculated hash values would differ.

	  transition races generating redundant statsd events.

	  We were reporting redundant statsd PJSIP.registrations.state changes
	  for internal state changes that equated to the same thing publicly.

	* res_rtp: Fix regression when IPv6 is not available.

	  The latest Release candidate fails to create RTP streams when IPv6
	  is not available. Due to the changes made in September the ast_sockaddr
	  structure passed around to create these streams is always of AF_INET6
	  type, causing failure when used for IPv4. This patch adds a utility
	  function to check for availability of IPv6 and applies such check
	  at startup to determine how to create the ast_sockaddr structures.

	* PJPROJECT logging: Made easier to get available logging levels.

	  Use of the new logging is as simple as issuing the new CLI command or
	  setting the new pjproject.conf option.

	  Other options that can affect the logging are how you have the pjproject
	  log levels mapped to Asterisk log types in pjproject.conf and if you have
	  configured Asterisk to log the DEBUG type messages.  Altering the
	  pjproject.conf level mapping shouldn't be necessary for most installations
	  as the default mapping is sensible.  Configuring Asterisk to log the DEBUG
	  message type is standard practice for collecting debug information.

	  * Added CLI "pjproject set log level" command to dynamically adjust the
	  maximum pjproject log message level.

	  * Added CLI "pjproject show log level" command to see the currently set
	  maximum pjproject log message level.

	  * Added pjproject.conf startup section "log_level" option to set the
	  initial maximum pjproject log message level so all messages could be
	  captured from initialization.

	  * Set PJ_LOG_MAX_LEVEL to 6 to compile in all defined logging levels into
	  bundled pjproject.  Pjproject will use the currently set run time log
	  level to determine if a log message is generated just like Asterisk
	  verbose and debug logging levels.

	  * In log_forwarder(), made always log enabled and mapped pjproject log
	  messages.  DEBUG mapped log messages are no longer gated by the current
	  Asterisk debug logging level.

	  * Removed RAII_VAR() from res_pjproject.c:get_log_level().

	* Frame deferral: Re-queue deferred frames one-at-a-time.

	  The recent change that made frame deferral into an API had a behavior
	  change to it. When frame deferral was completed, we would take all of
	  the deferred frames and queue them all onto the channel in one call to
	  ast_queue_frame_head(). Before frame deferral was API-ized, places that
	  performed manual frame deferral would actually take each deferred frame
	  and queue them onto the channel.

	  This change in behavior caused the confbridge_recording test to start
	  failing consistently. Without going too crazily deep into the details,
	  a channel was getting "stuck" in an ast_safe_sleep(). An AMI redirect
	  was attempting to break it out of the sleep, but because there were more
	  frames in the channel read queue than expected, the channel ended up
	  being unable to break from its sleep loop.

	  By restoring the behavior of individual frame queuing after deferral,
	  the test starts passing again.

	  Note, this points to a potential underlying issue pointing to an
	  "unbalance" that can occur when queuing multiple frames at once,
	  and so a follow-up issue is being created to investigate that
	  possibility.

	* res_pjsip/chan_sip: Advertise 'ws' in the SIP URI transport parameter

	  Per RFC 7118 5.2, the SIP URI 'transport' parameter should advertise
	  'ws' when WebSockets are to be used as the transport. This applies to
	  both secure and insecure WebSockets.

	  There were two bugs in Asterisk with respect to this:

	  (1) The most egregious occurs in res_pjsip. There, we advertise 'ws' for
	      insecure websockets and 'wss' for secure websockets. While this
	      would seem to make sense - since 'WS' and 'WSS' are used for the Via
	      Transport parameter - this is not the case for the SIP URI. This
	      patch corrects that by registering the secure websockets with
	      pjproject using the shorthand 'WS', and by returning 'ws' when asked
	      for the transport parameter. Note that in pjproject, it is perfectly
	      valid to have multiple transports use the same shorthand.

	  (2) In chan_sip, we return an upper-case version of the transport 'WS'
	      instead of 'ws'. Since we should be strict in what we send and
	      liberal in what we accept (within reason), this patch lower-cases
	      the transport before appending it to the parameter.

	* chan_sip: Fix segfault during module unload

	  If a TCP/TLS connection was pending (not accepted and not timed out) during
	  unload of chan_sip, Asterisk would segfault when trying to send a signal to
	  a thread whose thread ID hadn't been recorded yet. This commit fixes that by
	  recording the thread ID before calling the blocking connect() syscall.
	  This was a regression introduced by 776a14386a55b5425c7e9617eff8af8b45427144.

	  The above wasn't enough to fix the segfault, which was now delayed to the
	  point where connect() timed out. Therefore, it was necessary to also remove
	  the SA_RESTART flag from the SIGURG sigaction so that pthread_kill() could be
	  used to interruput the connect() syscall.
	  This was a regression introduced by 5d313f51b982a18f7321adcf7c7a4e822d8b2714.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: RTT miscalculation in RTCP

	  When retrieving RTCP stats for PJSIP channels, RTT values are unreliable.
	  RTT calculation is correct, but the data representation isn't.  RTT is
	  represented by a 32-bit fixed-point number with the integer part in the
	  first 16 bits and the fractional part in the last 16 bits.  In order to
	  get the RTT value, the fractional part is miscalculated, there is an
	  unnecessary 16 bit shift that causes overflow.  Besides this there is
	  another mistake, when transforming the integer value to the fixed point
	  fractional part via bitwise operation, that loses precision.

	  * RTT fractional part is no longer shifted, avoiding overflow.

	  * RTT fractional part is transformed to its fixed-point value more
	  precisely.

	  * Fixed timeval2ntp() and ntp2timeval() second fraction conversions.

	  * Fixed NTP timestamp report logging.  The usec was inexplicably
	  multiplied by 4096.

	* addons/chan_mobile: do not use strerror_r

	  The two reasons why it might be used are that some systems do not
	  implement strerror in thread safe manner, and that strerror_r returns
	  the error code in the string in case there's no error message.

	  However, all of asterisk elsewhere uses strerror() and assumes it
	  to be thread safe. And in chan_mobile the errno is also explicitly
	  printed so neither of the above reasons are valid.

	  The reasoning to remove usage is that there are actually two versions
	  of strerror_r: XSI and GNU. They are incompatible in their return
	  value, and there's no easy way to figure out which one is being
	  used. glibc gives you the GNU version if _GNU_SOURCE is defined,
	  but the same feature test macro is needed for other symbols. On
	  all other systems you assumedly get XSI symbol, and compilation warnings
	  as well as non-working error printing.

	  Thus the easiest solution is to just remove strerror_r and use
	  strerror as rest of the code. Alternative is to introduce ast_strerror
	  in separate translation unit so it can request the XSI symbol in
	  glibc case, and replace all usage of strerror.

	  The download process now has a timeout which will cause wget to retry

	  if the whole retrieval take smore than 30 seconds.

	  If the tarball retrieval works, the MD5SUM file is retrieved from
	  the downloads site and the md5 checksum is verified.

	  If either the tarball retrieval or MD5SUM retrieval fails, or the
	  checksums don't match, the entire process is retried once.  If it
	  fails again, any incomplete tarball is deleted.

	* pjproject: Use a much higher limit for PJ_ICE_MAX_CHECKS

	  The PJ_ICE_MAX_CHECKS constant is used by pjproject to determine how
	  many pairs of local/remote candidates will be made. If for some reason
	  we reach this upper bound, ICE will generally fail and no media will
	  flow between the browser and Asterisk.

	  This patch makes PJ_ICE_MAX_CHECKS set to the total possible number of
	  pairs of candidates we'd theoretically allow, which is
	  PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND^2. Prior to this patch, we simply multiplied
	  PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND by two; on systems with multiple interfaces (I blame
	  Docker), this is far too low to allow WebRTC calls to succeed.

	  Setting this to be PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND^2 allowed WebRTC calls to succeed
	  even when the system Asterisk was running on had quite a few virtual
	  interfaces.

	* apps/app_echo: Only relay a single video source change frame

	  In 9785e8d0, app_echo was updated to relay video source updates to the
	  channel for the purposes of displaying video in WebRTC tests.
	  Unfortunately, this can cause a Kafkaesque nightmare if two or more
	  Local channels are in a bridge together where their ends are in
	  app_echo. When this situation occurs, a video update sent into app_echo
	  will cause the video update to be relayed to the other Local channels,
	  causing another round of video updates, etc. In not much time at all,
	  the channel length queues will be overwhelmed, channel alert pipes will
	  fail, and all hell will break loose as Asterisk merrily continues to
	  throw more video update requests onto the channels.

	  This patch updates app_echo to *only* relay a single video update. Once
	  a video update has been made, all further video updates are dropped.
	  This meets the intended purpose of the original patch: if we get a video
	  update and we're in app_echo, go ahead and ask the sender to update
	  themselves. However, once we've got that video stream sync'd up, don't
	  keep spamming the world.

	* res/ari/resource_bridges: Add the ability to manipulate the video source

	  In multi-party bridges, Asterisk currently supports two video modes:
	   * Follow the talker, in which the speaker with the most energy is shown
	     to all participants but the speaker, and the speaker sees the
	     previous video source
	   * Explicitly set video sources, in which all participants see a locked
	     video source

	  Prior to this patch, ARI had no ability to manipulate the video source.
	  This isn't important for two-party bridges, in which Asterisk merely
	  relays the video between the participants. However, in a multi-party
	  bridge, it can be advantageous to allow an external application to
	  manipulate the video source.

	  This patch provides two new routes to accomplish this:
	  (1) setVideoSource: POST /bridges/{bridgeId}/videoSource/{channelId}
	      Sets a video source to an explicit channel
	  (2) clearVideoSource: DELETE /bridges/{bridgeId}/videoSource
	      Removes any explicit video source, and sets the video mode to talk
	      detection

	* res_pjsip_session: Do not call session supplements when it's too late.

	  res_pjsip_sesssion was hooking into transaction and invite state
	  changes. One of the reasons for doing so was due to the
	  PJSIP_EVENT_TX_MSG event. The idea was that we were hooking into the
	  message sending process, and so we should call session supplements to
	  alter the outgoing message.

	  In reality, this event was meant to indicate that the message either
	  a) had already been sent, or
	  b) required a DNS lookup and would be sent when the DNS query
	  completed.

	  In case (a), this meant we were altering an already-sent
	  request/response for no reason. In case (b), this potentially meant we
	  could be trying to alter a request/response at the same time that the
	  DNS resolution completed. In this case, it meant we might be stomping on
	  memory being used by the thread actually sending the message. This
	  caused potential crashes and memory corruption.

	  This patch removes the calls to session supplements from the case where
	  the PJSIP_EVENT_TX_MSG event occurs. In all of these cases, trying to
	  alter the message at this point is too late, and it can cause nothing
	  but harm to try to do it. Because there were no longer any calls to the
	  handle_outgoing() function, it has been removed.

	* AGI: Only defer frames when in an interception routine.

	  AGI recently was modified to defer important frames. This was because
	  when AGI was used in a connected line interception routine, the
	  resulting connected line frame would end up getting discarded by the
	  AGI.

	  However, this caused bad behavior in other cases. Specifically, during a
	  transfer, if someone attempted to manually set the Caller ID on a
	  channel in an AGI, the deferred connected line frame would end up
	  overwriting what had been manually set in the AGI.

	  Since the initial issue was specific to interception routines, this
	  change removes the manual frame deferral from AGI and instead uses the
	  new frame deferral API in interception routines.

	* bridges/bridge_softmix: Remove SSRC changes on join/leave; update video source

	  WebRTC clients really, really want to know the SSRC of the media they're
	  getting. Changing the SSRC is generally not a good thing.

	  bridge_softmix, starting in Asterisk 12, started changing the SSRC of
	  parties as they joined or left the bridge. With most phones, this isn't
	  a problem: phones just play back the stream they're getting. With WebRTC
	  clients, however, the SSRC is tied to a media stream that may be
	  negotiated. When a new SSRC just shows up, the media can be dropped.

	  As it turns out, the SSRC change shouldn't even be necessary. From the
	  perspective of the client, it's still talking to Asterisk with the same
	  media stream: why indicate that the far party has suddenly changed to a
	  different source of media?

	  This patch opts to just remove the SSRC changes. With this patch, video
	  clients that join/leave a softmix bridge actually get the video stream
	  instead of freaking out.

	* stasis_recording/stored: remove calls to deprecated readdir_r function.

	  The readdir_r function has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This
	  patch removes the readdir_r dependency (replaced it with readdir) and also moves
	  the directory search code to a more centralized spot (file.c)

	  Also removed a strict dependency on the dirent structure's d_type field as it
	  is not portable. The code now checks to see if the value is available. If so,
	  it tries to use it, but defaults back to using the stats function if necessary.

	  Lastly, for most implementations of readdir it *should* be thread-safe to make
	  concurrent calls to it as long as different directory streams are specified.
	  glibc falls into this category. However, since it is possible that there exist
	  some implementations that are not safe, locking has been added for those other
	  than glibc.

	* pjproject_bundled:  Fix issue with libasteriskpj needing libresample

	  libresample is only needed by pjproject if we're building pjsua, which
	  we only do if TEST_FRAMEWORK is selected.  It's required by pjsua to
	  process audio which is needed by some testsuite tests.  Unfortunately,
	  pjproject relies on a newer version of libresample than the version
	  that ships by most distros so we need to compile the version that's
	  bundled with pjproject.  Since we only need it for pjsua, we DON'T want
	  it's symbols exposed when we actually build asterisk.

	  There was a problem however... TEST_FRAMEWORK is only known AFTER we've
	  already run ./configure on both asterisk and pjproject but pjproject's
	  ./configure needs to test it to know whether to set up to build
	  libresample or not.  The previous way of figuring this out was to
	  always tell ./configure "yes" but not actually build the library.  This
	  caused an issue where building libasteriskpj was being told to include
	  libresample but it wasn't actually there.

	  The solution is to still do a default pjproject configure during an
	  asterisk ./configure but if makeopts or menuselect.makeopts changes
	  subsequently, we now reconfigure pjproject, taking into account the
	  current state of TEST_FRAMEWORK.  Previously, if makeopts or
	  menuselect.makeopts changed, only a recompile of pjproject was done.

	* app_dial: Fix incorrect device state when channel is picked up.

	  Given the scenario where multiple channels are dialed using Dial()
	  but the caller is picked up using PickupChan() all outgoing channels
	  except the channel specified to PickupChan() would be marked
	  as ringing until the call had been hung up.

	  When using the PickupChan application the channel executing the
	  application is swapped into place of another channel. As part
	  of this process the channel is answered. The Dial application
	  has explicit logic which checks if the channel is answered,
	  cancels all other outgoing channels, and bridges. This logic is
	  different than the normal logic that is executed when an outgoing
	  channel is answered. This different logic failed to publish dial
	  events stating that the other outgoing channels had been canceled.
	  As a result references to the outgoing channels were held onto by
	  the dial masquerade process until the call had been ended and
	  the channels had gone away. This would result in the channels
	  appearing in the "core show channels" list despite not being present
	  anymore and would also result in incorrect device state.

	  This change makes it so that this logic also publishes
	  dial events stating that the other outgoing channels have been
	  canceled.

	* pjsip: Fix a few media bugs with reinvites and asymmetric payloads.

	  When channel format changes occurred as a result of an RTP
	  re-negotiation the bridge was not informed this had happened.
	  As a result the bridge technology was not re-evaluated and the
	  channel may have been in a bridge technology that was incompatible
	  with its formats. The bridge is now unbridged and the technology
	  re-evaluated when this occurs.

	  The chan_pjsip module also allowed asymmetric codecs for sending
	  and receiving. This did not work with all devices and caused one
	  way audio problems. The default has been changed to NOT do this
	  but to match the sending codec to the receiving codec. For users
	  who want asymmetric codecs an option has been added, asymmetric_rtp_codec,
	  which will return chan_pjsip to the previous behavior.

	  The codecs returned by the chan_pjsip module when queried by
	  the bridge_native_rtp module were also not reflective of the
	  actual negotiated codecs. The nativeformats are now returned as
	  they reflect the actual negotiated codecs.

	* ARI: Detect duplicate channel IDs

	  ARI and AMI allow for an explicit channel ID to be specified
	  when originating channels. Unfortunately, there is nothing in
	  place to prevent someone from using the same ID for multiple
	  channels. Further complicating things, adding ID validation to channel
	  allocation makes it impossible for ARI to discern why channel allocation
	  failed, resulting in a vague error code being returned.

	  The fix for this is to institute a new method for channel errors to be
	  discerned. The method mirrors errno, in that when an error occurs, the
	  caller can consult the channel errno value to determine what the error
	  was. This initial iteration of the feature only introduces "unknown" and
	  "channel ID exists" errors. However, it's possible to add more errors as
	  needed.

	  ARI uses this feature to determine why channel allocation failed and can
	  return a 409 error during origination to show that a channel with the
	  given ID already exists.

	* CDR: Alter destruction pattern for CDR chains.

	  CDRs form chains. When the root of the chain is destroyed, it then
	  unreferences the next CDR in the chain. That CDR is destroyed, and it
	  then unreferences the next CDR in the chain. This repeats until the end
	  of the chain is reached. While this typically does not cause any sort of
	  problems, it is possible in strange scenarios for the CDR chain to grow
	  way longer than expected. In such a scenario, the destruction pattern
	  can result in a stack overflow.

	  This patch fixes the problem by switching from a recursive pattern to an
	  iterative pattern for destruction. When the root CDR is destroyed, it is
	  responsible for iterating over the rest of the CDRs and unreferencing
	  each one. Other CDRs in the chain, since they are not the root, will
	  simply destroy themselves and be done. This causes the stack depth not
	  to increase.

	* res/ari: Add the Asterisk EID field to outgoing events

	  This patch adds the Asterisk EID field to all outgoing ARI events.
	  Because this field should be added to all events as they are
	  transmitted, it is appended to the JSON message just prior to it being
	  handed off to the application message handler. This makes it somewhat
	  resilient to both new events being added to ARI, as well as other
	  potential event transport mechanisms.

	* utils.c:  Fix ast_set_default_eid for multiple platforms

	  ast_set_default_eid was searching for ethX, emX, enoX, ensX and even
	  pciD#U interface names.  While this was a good attempt, it wasn't
	  inclusive enough to capture interfaces like enp6s0 or ens6d1, etc.

	  Rather than relying on interface names, we now simply find the first
	  interface returned by the OS that has a hardware address and that
	  address isn't all 0x00 or all 0xff.  The code IS different for BSD,
	  Solaris and Linux based on what method is available for enumerating
	  interfaces.

	  Tested on:
	  FreeBSD9
	  CentOS6
	  Ubuntu14
	  Fedora24

	  I was unable to test on Solaris at this time but the code for Solaris
	  is used elsewhere at Digium.

	  to be set independently of the state of (auto_)force_rport. For example,
	  nat=force_rport,auto_comedia is useful for IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack deployments
	  when IPv6 clients are behind a Firewall.

	* chan_sip: Only send video on outgoing channel if incoming channel supports it

	  Previously, the settings videosupport=always and videosupport=yes behaved
	  identically and unconditionally caused a video offer to be sent in the SDP on
	  an outgoing call. This was a regression introduced with commit
	  5a1d90e1fbfc4b48927aad55311f3b38efbf1f54 in Asterisk 1.6.1.

	  This commit restores correct behavior: videosupport=always causes a video offer
	  to be sent unconditionally, while videosupport=yes will only offer video on an
	  outbound channel if the incoming channel it is bridged to also supports video.
	  That way, the device receiving the outgoing call can display the correct user
	  interface elements for audio or video and will not unnecessarily show a blank
	  video window on an audio-only call.

	* Fix issues with bundled pjproject cached download.

	  Previously when testing I had a preexisting makeopts in ASTTOPDIR.  The
	  ordering of configure.ac causes --with-externals-cache to be processed
	  after third-party configure.  In cases where the Asterisk clone is
	  cleaned it would cause pjproject to be downloaded to /tmp.  This
	  moves processing of the externals cache and sounds cache to happen
	  before third-party configure.

	  This also addresses a possible issue with the third-party Makefile.  If
	  TMPDIR is set by the environment it would override the path given to
	  --with-externals-cache.

	* res_config_mysql:  Fix several issues related to recent table changes

	  Unlike any of the other database drivers, res_config_mysql checks that
	  the table definition matches the requirements for every insert and
	  update statement.  Since all requirements are forced to 'char', any
	  column that isn't a char, like ps_contacts' expiration_time,
	  qualify_timeout, etc., will throw a warning.  It's kinda harmless but
	  very misleading.  Since no other driver does those checks on insert
	  or update, they've been removed from res_config_mysql.  Also, all
	  the logic that actually attempted to ALTER the table to fix the issue
	  has been removed.  With the move to alembic, the auto-alter
	  functionality is not only unnecessary, it's also dangerous.

	  The other issue is that res_config_mysql calls the mysql_insert_id
	  function inside store_mysql.  Presumably the intention was to return
	  the number of rows inserted DESPITE A NOTE IN THE CODE THAT THE VALUE
	  IS NON_PORTABLE AND MAY CHANGE.  That value is then returned to
	  config realtime as the number of rows inserted.  Guess what?  The value
	  changed.  It now only returns the number of rows inserted if there's an
	  auto increment column on the table, which ps_contacts doesn't have.
	  Otherwise it returns 0.  So now, the insert worked but we tell config
	  realtime and sorcery that no rows were inserted.  That call to
	  mysql_insert_id was removed and we now always return 1 if the insert
	  succeeded.  We're only inserting 1 row at a time anyway.  If the insert
	  fails, we still return -1.

	* alembic:  Allow cdr, config and voicemail to exist in the same schema

	  cdr, config and voicemail are all separate alembic trees.  Because
	  alembic's default is to use a table named 'alembic_version' to store
	  the current tree revision, the 3 trees can't exist in the same schema
	  without stepping on each other.

	  Now each tree uses 'alembic_version_<tree_name>' as the version table.
	  Each tree's env.py script now first checks for 'alembic_version'.  If
	  it finds it AND its revision is in the tree's history, the script
	  renames it to 'alembic_version_<tree_name>'.  Regardless, the script
	  then continues with the migration using 'alembic_version_<tree_name>'
	  and creates that table if it's not found.  The result is that if an
	  existing 'alembic_version' table was found but it didn't belong to this
	  tree, it's left alone and 'alembic_version_<tree_name>' is used or
	  created.

	  WARNING:  If multiple trees are using the same schema, they MUST NOT
	  CRU or D any objects with names that might exist in the other trees.
	  An example would be 'yesno_values' type.  If two trees perform
	  operations on it, one tree could pull it out from under the other.
	  Thankfully we currently don't share any names among cdr, config and
	  voicemail.

	  NOTE:  Since the env.py scripts in each tree were identical, a common
	  env.py has been placed in the ast-db-manage directory and a symlink
	  to it has been placed in each tree directory.

	* build_tools:  Add ability to download variants to download_externals

	  Some external packages have multiple variants that apply to different
	  builds of asterisk.  The DPMA for instance has a "bundled" variant that
	  needs to be downloaded if asterisk was configured with
	  --with-pjproject-bundled.

	  There are 2 ways to specify variants:

	  If you need the user to make the decision about which variant to
	  download, simply create multiple menuselect "member" entries like so...

	  <member name="res_digium_phone" displayname="..snipped..">
	    <support_level>external</support_level>
	    <depend>xmlstarlet</depend>
	    <depend>bash</depend>
	    <defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	  </member>

	  <member name="res_digium_phone-bundled" displayname="..snipped..">
	    <support_level>external</support_level>
	    <depend>xmlstarlet</depend>
	    <depend>bash</depend>
	    <defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	  </member>

	  Note that the second entry has "-<variant>" appended to the name.
	  You can then use the existing menuselect facilities to restrict which
	  members to enable or disable.  Youy probably don't want the user to
	  enable multiple at the same time.

	  If you want to hide the details of the variants, the better way to
	  do it is to create 1 member with "variant" elements.

	  <member name="res_digium_phone" displayname="..snipped..">
	    <support_level>external</support_level>
	    <depend>xmlstarlet</depend>
	    <depend>bash</depend>
	    <defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	    <member_data>
	      <downloader>
	        <variants>
	          <variant tag="bundled"
	            condition='[[ "$PJPROJECT_BUNDLED" = "yes" ]]'/>
	        </variants>
	      </downloader>
	    </member_data>
	  </member>

	  The condition must be a bash expression suitable for use with an "if"
	  statement.  Any environment variable can be used plus those available
	  in makeopts.

	  In this case, if asterisk was configured with --with-pjproject-bundled
	  the bundled variant will be automatically downloaded.  Otherwise the
	  normal version will be downloaded.

	* chan_sip: Resolve externhost not to IPv6; instead go for IPv4.

	  For the channel driver chan_sip, you specify externhost=example.com in sip.conf
	  when your Asterisk is behind a NAT and your IP address is assigned dynamically.
	  Or stated differently: You do not have a static IP address to use "externaddr"
	  directly. This NAT support is quite handy but just about IPv4. Previously,
	  Asterisk resolved "externhost" to any IP version. When the first DNS answer
	  resolved to an IPv6, Asterisk sent an IPv6 in SIP/SDP for origin (o=) and
	  connection (c=). This happened in outgoing SIP-REGISTER and while answering
	  SIP-INVITE. If the remote peer is IPv4-only, it might not handle o=/c= with an
	  IPv6. This change makes sure, no IPv6 is resolved anymore for "externhost".

	* chan_sip:  Address runaway when realtime peers subscribe to mailboxes

	  Users upgrading from asterisk 13.5 to a later version and who use
	  realtime with peers that have mailboxes were experiencing runaway
	  situations that manifested as a continuous stream of taskprocessor
	  congestion errors, memory leaks and an unresponsive chan_sip.

	  A related issue was that setting rtcachefriends=no NEVER worked in
	  asterisk 13 (since the move to stasis).  In 13.5 and earlier, when a
	  peer tried to register, all of the stasis threads would block and
	  chan_sip would again become unresponsive.  After 13.5, the runaway
	  would happen.

	  There were a number of causes...
	  * mwi_event_cb was (indirectly) calling build_peer even though calls to
	    mwi_event_cb are often caused by build_peer.
	  * In an effort to prevent chan_sip from being unloaded while messages
	    were still in flight, destroy_mailboxes was calling
	    stasis_unsubscribe_and_join but in some cases waited forever for the
	    final message.
	  * add_peer_mailboxes wasn't properly marking the existing mailboxes
	    on a peer as "keep" so build_peer would always delete them all.
	  * add_peer_mwi_subs was unsubscribing existing mailbox subscriptions
	    then just creating them again.

	  All of this was causing a flood of subscribes and unsubscribes on
	  multiple threads all for the same peer and mailbox.

	  Fixes...
	  * add_peer_mailboxes now marks mailboxes correctly and build_peer only
	    deletes the ones that really are no longer needed by the peer.
	  * add_peer_mwi_subs now only adds subscriptions marked as "new" instead
	    of unsubscribing and resubscribing everything.  It also adds the peer
	    object's address to the mailbox instead of its name to the subscription
	    userdata so mwi_event_cb doesn't have to call build_peer.

	  With these changes, with rtcachefriends=yes (the most common setting),
	  there are no leaks, locks, loops or crashes at shutdown.

	  rtcachefriends=no still causes leaks but at least it doesn't lock, loop
	  or crash.  Since making rtcachefriends=no work wasnt in scope for this
	  issue, further work will have to be deferred to a separate patch.

	  Side fixes...
	   * The ast_lock_track structure had a member named "thread" which gdb
	     doesn't like since it conflicts with it's "thread" command.  That
	     member was renamed to "thread_id".

	* pjproject_bundled:  Prevent SERVFAIL from marking name server bad

	  A name server that returns "Server Failure" is indicating only that
	  the server couldn't process that particular request.  We should NOT
	  assume that the name server is incapable of serving other requests.

	  Here's the scenario we've been encountering...

	  * 2 local name servers configured in resolv.conf.
	  * An OPTIONS request causes a request for A and AAAA records to go out
	    to both nameservers.
	  * The A responses both come back successfully resolved.
	  * Because of an issue at some upstream nameserver, the AAAA responses
	    for that particular query come back as "SERVFAIL" from both local
	    name servers.
	  * Both local servers are marked as bad and no further queries can be
	    sent until the 60 second ttl expires.  Only previously cached results
	    can be used.
	  * In this case, 60 seconds is just enough time for another OPTIONS
	    request to go out to the same host so the cycle repeats.

	  We could set the bad ttl really low but that also affects REFUSED and
	  NOTAUTH which probably DO signal a real server issue.  Besides, even
	  a really low bad ttl would be an issue on a pbx.

	  Although we use our own resolver in 14 and master and don't have this
	  issue there, Teluu has merged this patch upstream so it's appropriate
	  to cherry-pick to 14 and master to keep pjproject consistent.

	* rtp: Preserve timestamps on video frames.

	  Currently when receiving video over RTP we store only
	  a calculated samples on the frame. When starting the video
	  it can take some time for this calculation to actually yield

	  if a video frame passes over multiple RTP packets this calculation

	  packet and the number of samples calculated will be 0.

	  This change preserves the timestamp on the frame and allows
	  it to pass through the core. When sending the video this timestamp
	  is used instead of a new one being calculated.

	* chan_sip: Don't allocate new RTP instances on top of old ones.

	  In some scenarios dialog_initialize_rtp can be called multiple times on
	  the same dialog.  This can cause RTP instances to be leaked along with
	  multiple file descriptors for each instance.

	  This change makes it so the existing RTP instances are destroyed and
	  not overwritten, stopping the memory leak.

	* res_pjsip: Do not crash on ACKs from unknown endpoints.

	  The endpoint identification PJSIP module is intended to identify which
	  endpoint an incoming request is from. If an endpoint is not identified,
	  then an artificial endpoint is used in its place when proceeding.

	  The problem is that the ACK request type is an exception to the rule.
	  The artificial endpoint is not used when processing an ACK. This results
	  in the possibility of having a NULL endpoint being used further on.

	  The reason ACK is an exception is an attempt not to spam security logs
	  with unidentified requests. Presumably, you've already logged the
	  unidentified request on the preceeding INVITE.

	  Up until Asterisk 13.10, retrieving a NULL endpoint in this fashion
	  didn't cause an issue. A new change in 13.10 added endpoint ACL checking
	  shortly after endpoint identification. Because we are accessing a NULL
	  endpoint, this ACL check resulted in a crash.

	  The fix here is to be sure to retrieve the artificial endpoint for all
	  request types. ACKs still do not generate unidentified request security
	  events.

	* build: Add download capability for external packages

	  The DPMA and g729a, silk, siren7 and siren14 codecs hosted at
	  http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/ are now listed in the
	  "External" sections of the "Resource Modules" and "Codec Translators"
	  pages in menuselect.  Any that are selected will automatically be
	  downloaded and installed when "make install" is run.  Their LICENSE and
	  README (if avaialble) files will be installed to
	  ASTVARLIBDIR/documentation/thirdparty/<product_name>.

	  Example use with codecs:

	  The codecs/codecs.xml file is a menuselect style xml file that lists
	  the codecs to be included.  Their support levels are 'external', which
	  triggers the download and install, and defaultenabled is no.  Also
	  because codec_g729a is actually in a directory named codec_g729 on the
	  download server, the newly added 'member_data' element is used to
	  override the default of the directory name being the package name.  You
	  can use the 'directory_name' attribute to keep default base URL
	  (http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/) but use the new directory,
	  or you use the 'remote_url' attribute to specify a full URL to the
	  download directory.  In this case, you must still follow the same
	  subdirectory naming conventions as that used for the packages located
	  at 'http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony'.

	  A new configure option '--with-externals-cache' was added and like
	  '--with-sounds-cache' it allows the installer to cache tarballs so
	  they're not downloaded every time.

	  To assist with the download and install process, each external package
	  now has a manifest.xml file that, among other things, contains a package
	  version and checksums for each file in the tarball.  The manifest is
	  saved to both the cache directory and ASTMODDIR and together with the
	  manifest.xml on the downloads site, tells the install scripts whether
	  a download and/or update is needed.

	  bash and xmlstarlet are required for downloader operation.  If they're
	  not installed, the external items in menuselect will be unavailable.

	* chan_sip: Don't refuse calls with "optional crypto"; fall back to RTP.

	  Certain SNOM phones send so-called "optional crypto" in their SDP body.
	  Regular SRTP setup looks like this:

	      m=audio 64620 RTP/SAVP 8 0 9 99 3 18 4 101
	      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 inline:...

	  SNOM-style "optional crypto" looks like this:

	      m=audio 61438 RTP/AVP 8 0 9 99 3 18 4 101
	      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 inline:...

	  A crypto line is supplied, but the m-line does not have SAVP.

	  When res_srtp.so is *not* loaded, then chan_sip.so treats the optional
	  crypto as regular RTP, but when res_srtp.so *is* loaded, it refuses the
	  incoming call with the following message:

	      WARNING: process_sdp: Failed to receive SDP offer/answer with
	      required SRTP crypto attributes for audio

	  For platforms that want to start providing SRTP this presents a
	  compatibility problem.

	  This changeset lets chan_sip handle the SDP as if no crypto-line was
	  supplied: i.e. accept the call as regular RTP, just like it did before
	  res_srtp was loaded.

	  Now you'll get this informative warning instead:

	      WARNING: Ignoring crypto attribute in SDP because RTP transport is
	      insecure

	* res_pjsip_session: segfault on already disconnected session

	  On heavy loaded system the TCP/TLS incoming calls could be
	  disconnected by pjproject while these calls are being
	  processed by asterisk which could use the session's memory pools.
	  If the session in the disconnected state then the session memory
	  pools were already freed, so we get segfault.

	  This patch adds a lifetime control on an INVITE session to pjproject.
	  The lifetime of the session is manipulated by calling
	  pjsip_inv_add_ref/pjsip_inv_dec_ref.
	  This patch uses these functions to inform pjproject that the
	  session is in use.

	  This patch adds check if the session state is not disconnected
	  and also checks if the memory pool is not NULL.

	  This patch also places tasks 'session_end' and 'session_end_completion'
	  into session's serializer to avoid race condition.

	* ConfBridge: Make some announcements asynchronous.

	  Confbridge announcements tend to block a channel while they are being
	  played. In some circumstances, this is warranted since you want that
	  particular channel not to hear the announcement (Example: "John Doe has
	  entered the conference"). For others it makes less sense.

	  This change first introduces methods for playing sounds asynchronously
	  into the conference. This is very similar to how synchronous sounds are
	  played, except the channel initiating the playback does not wait for the
	  sound to complete before moving on.

	  Asynchronous announcements are used for two circumstances:
	  * Sounds played for a user after they have left the bridge
	  * Sounds that play first to a single user and then the rest of the
	    conference (if the channel and conference use the same language)

	* app_mp3: Use correct buffer size and the same sample rate as the channel

	  Previously, the buffer used for MP3 streamed from HTTP servers had a size of
	  1 MB. For 8 kHz mono audio at 16 bit resolution, such a buffer covers about 1
	  minute. Only when the buffer is full does audio start to play.
	  For MP3 files streamed from a server, that is usually not a big deal as long as
	  the connection to the server is fast enough to supply that much data within a
	  second or two. For MP3 live streams however, it takes 1 minute to download 1
	  minute of audio, so without this change, app_mp3 wasn't really usable for MP3
	  live streams.
	  This commit changes the buffer size so that it covers 6 seconds of an MP3 file
	  streamed from a server and 0.5 seconds of an MP3 live stream. The latter is
	  identified by the use of a .m3u file extension.

	  app_mp3 so far only supported 8 kHz audio.
	  Now it always runs at the sample rate of the channel.

	* res_fax: Fix deadlock setting FAXMODE channel variable.

	  ASTERISK-25980 added the FAXMODE channel variable to res_fax.c.
	  Unfortunately, it also introduced a deadlock potential because
	  set_channel_variables() which sets FAXMODE can be called during a
	  masquerade.  The ast_channel_get_t38_state() which gets the value used to
	  set FAXMODE cannot be called with the channel locked.  As a result, local
	  channels can deadlock because of how they must acquire the locks necessary
	  to operate.

	  The intent of FAXMODE is for dialplan to know how a fax was transferred
	  after the fax completes.  However, the previous patch sets FAXMODE to the
	  channel's current T.38 state AFTER the fax has completed and where T.38
	  may have already disconnected.

	* res_fax.c: Fix deadlock in fax_gateway_indicate_t38().

	  fax_gateway_indicate_t38() calls ast_indicate_data() which cannot be
	  called with any channel locks already held.  A deadlock can happen if the
	  function is operating on a local channel.

	  * Made fax_gateway_indicate_t38() unlock the channel before calling
	  ast_indicate_data() since fax_gateway_indicate_t38() is always called with
	  the channel locked.

	  * Made fax_gateway_indicate_t38() return void since nothing cared about
	  its return value.

	* ConfBridge: Rework announcer channel methodology

	  NOTE: This patch was submitted earlier and reverted because of a failing
	  test. The test has been patched so that it adjusts for the changes here,
	  so this is being resubmitted for review.

	  One feature that confbridge has is the ability to play sounds to all
	  participants in the conference. Prior to this commit, the algorithm for
	  this was as follows:

	  * Grab the playback lock
	  * Push the conference announcer channel into the bridge
	  * Play back the sound
	  * Pull the conference announcer channel from the bridge
	  * Release the playback lock

	  The issue here is that the act of adding the playback channel to the
	  bridge and removing it for each announcement is expensive. Amongst the
	  expenses:

	  * The announcer channel is imparted into the bridge, meaning a new
	    thread is spun up for each playback.
	  * When the announcer is added or removed from the bridge, it results
	    in the BRIDGEPEER channel variable being set on all channels in the
	    bridge. This requires keeping the bridge locked and locking each
	    individual channel in order to set it.
	  * There's also just the general overhead of adding the channel and
	    removing it from the bridge. The bridge potentially has to reconfigure
	    every single time

	  With this commit, the paradigm for playing back announcements has
	  shifted.

	  * The announcer channel is now added to the bridge when the conference
	    is allocated, and it is hung up when the conference is destroyed.
	  * A taskprocessor is used to queue playbacks onto the announcer channel.
	    This keeps the behavior from before where playbacks do not overlap.
	  * The announcer channel is no longer placed into the bridge as
	    departable. Since we are not constantly removing the channel from
	    the bridge, it is safe to add the channel using an independent thread
	    and simply hang the channel up when it is time for the conference to
	    be destroyed.

	  The use of the taskprocessor for playbacks opens up the interesting
	  possibility of having asynchronous announcements played. In this commit,
	  however, the behavior is still exactly the same as it previously was.

	* res_pjsip: Default endpoints to the "offline" status.

	  A recent change attempted to optimize startup by not updating contact
	  status. Instead, code responsible for qualifying contacts updates the
	  status as it becomes known. The code even accounts for contacts/AORs
	  that are not set to be qualified.

	  The problem, though, is when there are no contacts associated with an
	  endpoint. A common case is when an endpoint is set to register its
	  contacts but has not done so yet. In this case, prior to registration,
	  the endpoint's device state will appear to be "not in use" and hints
	  associated with that device will appear to be "idle". In actuality, the
	  device state and hint should both appear as "unavailable". The reason
	  for the failure is that the optimization change made all persistent
	  endpoint states set to "unknown".

	  The fix here is to change the hard-coded "unknown" to be "offline"
	  instead. The default state will be offline until the qualifying code
	  determines that the contact is actually online. This way, if there are
	  no contacts at all, then the state stays as offline, and device state
	  and hints appear correctly.

	  When res_odbc_transaction depended on res_odbc, it got the generic_odbc

	  its dependency on generic_odbc must be explicit.

	* pjproject_bundled: Allow IPv4/IPv6 (Dual Stack) configurations.

	  PJProject supports a lot of platforms even Windows, some with different defaults
	  when it comes to IPv6. In many Linux platforms like Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
	  "/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only" is set to 0 (false). Different than in Windows.

	  Because of this, if configured with just an IPv6 address/transport, PJProject
	  listens to both IPv4 and IPv6. However, this is not supported by the PJProject
	  team. As consequence, you end-up with IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in SDP,
	  incompatible with IPv4-only clients. Technically, you end-up with an IPv6-only
	  server which accepts incoming connections on IPv4.

	  If you try to configure two transports, one with IPv4 and one with IPv6 on the
	  same interface, as expected by the PJProject team, the IPv4 transport is not
	  able to bind because the IPv6 transport listens to both already.

	  One solution would be to change "/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only" system-wide.
	  Then, you are able to configure two transports, one for each IP version on the
	  same interface. That way, you get a server which works with IPv4 clients and
	  IPv6 clients at the same time over the same interface.

	  Here, this change sets this parameter directly within PJProject to match the
	  expectations of the PJProject team in any case. This allows IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack
	  servers out of the box like in chan_sip. This change was accepted by the
	  PJProject team as <http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/changeset/5403> and is expected
	  to arrive in the next version, PJProject 2.6.0. Until then, this change is
	  incorporated in the bundled PJProject of Asterisk.

	* sip.conf: tlsclientmethod is using sslv23 as default.

	  When 'tlsclientmethod' is not specified in sip.conf, chan_sip uses the OpenSSL
	  SSLv23_method. This was documented incorrectly in the file sip.conf.sample.

	  SSLv23_method got its name in the 90s. Today, with OpenSSL 1.0.2, this method
	  enables (just) the secure TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.2. Or stated differently, that
	  function should have been called 'secure_method' or 'automatic_method' back in
	  the 90s.

	  Consequently please, specify 'tlsclientmethod=tlsv1' in your sip.conf only if
	  you face a server which has problems like not falling back to TLSv1.0
	  automatically.

	* res_format_attr_g729: Add annexb=no format parameter to SDPs

	  Historically, Asterisk has always specified annexb=no for the g729 format.
	  However, when using res_pjsip no format attribute was specified. This patch
	  makes it so the SDP now contains a format attribute line with annexb=no.

	  Note, that this means only g729a is negotiated. Even for pass through support.
	  According to rfc7261 the type of annex used (a or b) is dependent upon the
	  answerer. However, Asterisk being a back to back user agent makes this tricky
	  to support at this time, thus we only allow annex 'a' for now.

	* pjsip: Fix deadlock with suspend taskprocessor on masquerade

	  If both channels which should be masqueraded
	  are in the same serializer:
	  1st channel will be locked waiting condition 'complete'
	  2nd channel will be locked waiting condition 'suspended'

	  On heavy load system a chance that both channels will be in
	  the same serializer 'pjsip/distibutor' is very high.

	  To reproduce compile res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c with
	  DISTRIBUTOR_POOL_SIZE=1

	  Steps to reproduce:
	  1. Party A calls Party B (bridged call 'AB')
	  2. Party B places Party A on hold
	  3. Party B calls Voicemail app (non-bridged call 'BV')
	  4. Party B attended transfers Party A to voicemail using REFER.
	  5. When asterisk masquerades calls 'AB' and 'BV',
	     a deadlock is happened.

	  This patch adds a suspension indicator to the taskprocessor.
	  When a session suspends/unsuspends the serializer
	  it sets the indicator to the appropriate state.
	  The session checks the suspension indicator before
	  suspend the serializer.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Cache local RTCP address.

	  When an RTCP packet is sent or received, res_rtp_asterisk generates a
	  Stasis event that contains the RTCP report as well as the local and
	  remote addresses that the report pertains to.

	  The addresses are determined using ast_find_ourip(). For the local
	  address, this will typically result in a lookup of the hostname of the
	  server, and then a DNS lookup of that hostname. If you do not have the
	  host in /etc/hosts, then this results in a full DNS lookup, which can
	  potentially block for some time.

	  This is especially problematic when performing RTCP reads, since those
	  are done on the same thread responsible for reading and writing media.

	  This patch addresses the issue by performing a lookup of the local
	  address when RTCP is allocated. We then use this cached local address
	  for the Stasis events when necessary.

	* Remove SILK payload mappings from Asterisk core.

	  SILK is a bit of a hog when it comes to using up our limited number of
	  dynamic payload types in the RTP engine. By freeing up four slots, it
	  allows for other codecs to potentially take the place.

	  Now, codec_silk.so will dynamically use the payload slots in the RTP
	  engine when it loads.

	  A better fix would be make RTP dynamic payload types actually
	  dynamic. However, at this stage of Asterisk 14 development, this is a
	  risky move that would be imprudent.

	* pbx.c: Fix handling of '-' in extension name and callerid

	  This adds a two strings to ast_exten.  name to go with exten and
	  cidmatch_display to go with cidmatch.  The new fields contain input used
	  to add the extension in the first place.  The existing fields now
	  contain stripped input that excludes insignificant spaces and dashes.
	  These stripped fields should always be used for comparisons.  The
	  unstripped fields should normally be used for display, but displaying
	  stripped values will not cause runtime errors.

	  Note the actual string is only stored twice if it contains dashes.  If
	  no dashes are found then both 'char *' fields point to the same memory.
	  So this change has a minimum effect on memory usage.

	  The existing functions ast_get_extension_name and
	  ast_get_extension_cidmatch return unstripped values as they did before
	  this change.  Other similar bugs likely still exist where unstripped
	  extensions are saved outside pbx.c then passed back in.

	  stronger than the background noise they must also be a minimum strength.

	* chan_sip: Enable Session-Timers for SIP over TCP (and TLS).

	  Asterisk defaults to timers=accept/refresher=uas. In that scenario, only in that
	  scenario, Sessions-Timers (RFC 4028) had no effect via TCP. This change enables
	  Session-Timers for SIP over TCP (and for SIP over TLS).

	  However with longer international calls via TCP, the SIP channel might break,
	  because all hops on the Internet route must stay online (have not a single power
	  outage, for example). Therefore with Session-Timers enabled (which are enabled
	  at default), you might see dropped calls. Consequently even with this change,
	  you might be better-off going for session-timers=refuse in your sip.conf.

	  sip_show_channels locks the dialogs container first then locks each

	  if it needs to.  Both lock in the order they need but deadlocks can
	  result.  To fix, sip_show_channels and sip_show_channelstats have
	  been converted to use an iterator rather than ao2_callback.  This way
	  the container is locked only while getting the next entry and is
	  unlocked when the callback is called.

	  The function create_mwi_subscriptions_for_endpoint checks
	  if there is active contacts by retrieving aors and contacts.

	  This function is used to create all unsolicited mwi subscriptions
	  on startup and is used when contact added.

	  In both cases it's not necessary to check if there are contacts.
	  The contacts are needed when asterisk sends mwi.

	* Update support for SILK format.

	  This commit adds scaffolding in order to support the SILK audio format
	  on calls. Roughly, this is what is added:

	  * Cached silk formats. One for each possible sample rate.
	  * ast_codec structures for each possible sample rate.
	  * RTP payload mappings for "SILK".

	  In addition, this change overhauls the res_format_attr_silk file in the
	  following ways:

	  * The "samplerate" attribute is scrapped. That's native to the format.
	  * There are far more checks to ensure that attributes have been
	    allocated before attempting to reference them.
	  * We do not SDP fmtp lines for attributes set to 0.

	  These changes make way to be able to install a codec_silk module and
	  have it actually work. It also should allow for passthrough silk calls
	  in Asterisk.

	* app_queue: Only remove queue member from pending when state changes.

	  It is possible for a not in use state change to occur multiple
	  times causing a queue member to be removed from the pending call
	  container prematurely.

	  The first not in use state change will remove the queue member
	  from the container. At this moment the member may be called and
	  placed in the pending container. After this another not in use
	  state change can be received which will remove it from the
	  container. Despite being called at this point the code will
	  incorrectly see that there are no pending calls to it.

	  This change only removes it from the pending container if the
	  state has actually changed.

	* translate: explicit format destination not properly set

	  If the destination format's name differed from the codec name then the
	  translator's explict_dst field would be improperly set. In some circumstances
	  it would end up setting it to a newly created format that has the same name
	  as the codec when it actually needed to be the given destination codec.

	  This could cause the translation path to use the wrong format. For instance,
	  if an endpoint had specified 'myulaw' as a format the translator could end up
	  using a 'ulaw' format (with whatever/default settings) instead. If the format
	  attribute settings differed between the two then there may unexpected results
	  during processing.

	  This patch removes the name check when building the translation path. This
	  should make it always set the translator's explicit_dst to the given destination
	  format as long as the sample rate and types match.

	  The ASTERISK-25904 change-id I8fad8aae9305481469c38d2146e1ba3a56d3108f
	  patch introduced several regressions when the newly created "Updated"
	  state goes out for each endpoint registration refresh.

	  1) It restarted any OPTIONS RTT ping cycle.

	  2) It would interfere with a currently active ping and throw off that
	  ping's resulting RTT calculation.

	  3) It cleared the RTT time each time the endpoint was refreshed.

	  4) The cleared RTT time was sent out as a statsd update each time.

	  5) It created two AMI events for each update.

	  * Revert the original patch and reimplement it.  Now the current contact
	  status state is re-sent instead of the state being momentarily toggled
	  every time the endpoint refreshes its registration.  The statsd events are
	  not created for the re-sent refresh because they are sent after every
	  OPTIONS ping.

	* res/res_corosync: Raise a Stasis message on node join/leave events

	  When res_corosync detects that a node leaves or joins, it currently is
	  informed of this via Corosync callbacks. However, there are a few
	  limitations with the information presented:
	  (1) While we have information that Corosync is aware of - such as the
	      Corosync nodeid - that information is really only useful inside of
	      Corosync or res_corosync. There's no way to translate a Corosync
	      nodeid to some other internally useful unique identifier for the
	      Asterisk instance that just joined or left the cluster.
	  (2) While res_corosync is notified of the instance joining or leaving
	      the cluster, it has no mechanism to inform the Asterisk core or
	      other modules of this event. This limits the usefulness of res_corosync
	      as a heartbeat mechanism for other modules.

	  This patch addresses both issues.

	  First, it adds the notion of a cluster discovery message both within the
	  Stasis message bus, as well as the binary event messages that
	  res_corosync uses to transmit data back and forth within the cluster.
	  When Asterisk joins the cluster, it sends a discovery message to the other
	  nodes in the cluster, which correlates the Corosync nodeid along with
	  the Asterisk EID. res_corosync now maintains a hash of Corosync nodeids
	  to Asterisk EIDs, such that it can map changes in cluster state with the
	  Asterisk instance that has that nodeid. Likewise, when an Asterisk
	  instance receives a discovery message from a node in the cluster, it now
	  sends its own discovery message back to the originating node with the
	  local Asterisk EID. This lets Asterisk instances within the cluster
	  build a complete picture of the other Asterisk instances within the
	  cluster.

	  Second, it publishes the discovery messages onto the Stasis message bus.
	  Said messages are published whenever a node joins or leaves the cluster.
	  Interested modules can subscribe for the ast_cluster_discovery_type()
	  message under the ast_system_topic() and be notified when changes in
	  cluster state occur.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Address SEGV when attempting to terminate a subscription

	  Occasionally under load we'll attempt to send a final NOTIFY on a
	  subscription that's already been terminated and a SEGV will occur
	  down in pjproject's evsub_destroy function.  This is a result of a
	  race condition between all the paths that can generate a notify
	  and/or destroy the underlying pjproject evsub object:

	   * The client can send a SUBSCRIBE with Expires: 0.
	   * The client can send a SUBSCRIBE/refresh.
	   * The subscription timer can expire.
	   * An extension state can change.
	   * An MWI event can be generated.
	   * The pjproject transaction timer (timer_b) can expire.

	  Normally when our pubsub_on_evsub_state is called with a terminate,
	  we push a task to the serializer and return at which point the dialog
	  is unlocked.  This is usually not a problem because the task runs
	  immediately and locks the dialog again.  When the system is heavily
	  loaded though, there may be a delay between the unlock and relock
	  during which another event may occur such as the subscription timer
	  or timer_b expiring, an extension state change, etc.  These may also
	  cause a terminate to be processed and if so, we could cause pjproject
	  to try to destroy the evsub structure twice.  There's no way for us to
	  tell that the evsub was already destroyed and the evsub's group lock
	  can't tolerate this and SEGVs.

	  The remedy is twofold.

	   * A patch has been submitted to Teluu and added to the bundled
	     pjproject which adds add/decrement operations on evsub's group lock.

	   * In res_pjsip_pubsub:
	     * configure.ac and pjproject-bundled's configure.m4 were updated
	       to check for the new evsub group lock APIs.
	     * We now add a reference to the evsub group lock when we create
	       the subscription and remove the reference when we clean up the
	       subscription.  This prevents evsub from being destroyed before
	       we're done with it.
	     * A state has been added to the subscription tree structure so
	       termination progress can be tracked through the asyncronous tasks.
	     * The pubsub_on_evsub_state callback has been split so it's not doing
	       double duty.  It now only handles the final cleanup of the
	       subscription tree.  pubsub_on_rx_refresh now handles both client
	       refreshes and client terminates.  It was always being called for
	       both anyway.
	     * The serialized_on_server_timeout task was removed since
	       serialized_pubsub_on_rx_refresh was almost identical.
	     * Missing state checks and ao2_cleanups were added.
	     * Some debug levels were adjusted to make seeing only off-nominal
	       things at level 1 and nominal or progress things at level 2+.

	* res_pjsip_session: Handle race condition at shutdown with timer.

	  When shutting down res_pjsip_session will get unloaded before res_pjsip.
	  The act of unloading unregisters all the PJSIP services and sets
	  their module IDs to -1. In some cases it is possible for a timer to
	  occur after this happens which calls into res_pjsip_session. The
	  res_pjsip_session module can then try to get the session from the
	  INVITE session using the module ID. Since the module ID is now -1
	  this fails.

	  This change stores a copy of the module ID and uses it for the timer
	  callback scenario. If the module ID is -1 the callback immediately
	  returns but if the module ID is valid then it continues as normal.

	  This works as the original ID of the module is guaranteed to still
	  be valid when used with the INVITE session.

	* ARI: Ensure announcer channels are destroyed.

	  Announcer channels were not being destroyed because the
	  stasis_app_control structure that referenced them was not being
	  destroyed. The control structure was not being destroyed because it was
	  not being unlinked from its container. It was not being unlinked from
	  its container because the after bridge callback for the announcer
	  channel was not being run. The after bridge callback was not being run
	  because the after bridge datastore was not being removed from the
	  channel on destruction. The channel was not being destroyed because the
	  hangup that used to destroy the channel was now only reducing the
	  reference count to one. The reference count of the channel was only
	  being reduced to one because the stasis_app_control structure was
	  holding the final reference...

	  The control structure used to not keep a reference to the channel, so
	  that loop described above did not happen.

	  The solution is to manually remove the control structure from its
	  container when the playback on a bridge is complete.

	* cel: Ensure only one dial status per channel exists.

	  CEL wrongly assumed that a channel would only have a single dial
	  event on it. This is incorrect. Particularly in a queue each
	  call attempt to a member will result in a dial event, adding
	  a new dial status in CEL without removing the old one. This
	  would cause the container to grow with only one dial status
	  being removed when the channel went away. The other dial status
	  entries would remain leaking memory.

	  This change fixes the memory leak by ensuring that only one dial
	  status will only ever exist for each channel.

	  The behavior during the scenario where multiple events are received
	  has also been improved. For failure cases the first failure will
	  be the dial status. If an answer dial status is received, though,
	  it will take priority and the dial status for the channel will be
	  answer.

	  Memory usage has also been decreased by storing the minimal
	  amount of information and the code has been cleaned up slightly.

	* chan_pjsip: Lock channel when checking for RTP changes.

	  bridge_native_rtp can call into an RTP-capable channel driver in order
	  for the driver to update information about who the channel is
	  communicating with. For SIP channel drivers, this means deactivating
	  RTCP and sending a reinvite so that the endpoints can communicate
	  directly.

	  bridge_native_rtp does the right thing and has the channel locked when
	  calling into the channel driver. chan_pjsip can't alter session
	  properties in this thread, though. chan_pjsip queues a task on the
	  session serializer in order to update properties there.

	  The problem is that this queued task was not locking the channel. This
	  meant that the queued task could attempt to deactivate RTCP at the same
	  time that the channel thread was attempting to process an incoming RTCP
	  packet. This could lead to a crash.

	  This patch fixes the issue by locking the channel in the queued task
	  when altering RTP properties.

	* res_hep_{pjsip|rtcp}: Decline module loads if res_hep had not loaded

	  A crash can occur in res_hep_pjsip or res_hep_rtcp if res_hep has not
	  loaded and does not have a configuration file. Previously when this
	  occurred, checks were put in to see if the configuration was loaded
	  successfully. While this is a good idea - and has been added to the
	  offending function in res_hep - the reality is res_hep_pjsip and
	  res_hep_rtcp have no business running if res_hep isn't also running.

	  As such, this patch also adds a function to res_hep that returns whether
	  or not it successfully loaded. Oddly enough, ast_module_check returns
	  "everything is peachy" even if a module declined its load - so it cannot
	  be solely relied on. res_hep_pjsip and res_hep_rtcp now also check this
	  function to see if they should continue to load; if it fails, they
	  decline their load as well.

	* res_pjsip_registrar.c: Eliminate rx REGISTER request race condition.

	  This patch fixes a race condition processing received REGISTER requests
	  and their retransmissions caused by REGISTER requests being processed by
	  two threads.  The "sip_transaction Unable to register REGISTER transaction
	  (key exists)" message is a notable symptom of this issue.

	  This issue was more likely to happen before the pjsip/distributor
	  serializers were created.  Instead of steps one and two below placing the
	  REGISTER messages into the same pjsip/distributor they were placed in
	  random pjsip/default serializers.

	  1) REGISTER requests come in and get placed on the pjsip/distributor
	  serializer.

	  2) Before the first request is processed a retransmission comes in and is
	  placed on the same pjsip/distributor serializer.

	  3) The first request goes up the pjsip stack and is then shunted off to
	  the pjsip/aor/<aor> serializer.

	  4) Before the first request is completed processing in the pjsip/aor/<aor>
	  serializer, the second request goes up the pjsip stack and is also shunted
	  off to the pjsip/aor/<aor> serializer.

	  5) The first request completes processing and sends out its response.

	  6) The second request completes processing and tries to send out its
	  response but pjlib complains that the REGISTER transaction key already
	  exists.

	  7) Sadness ensues.

	  * The race is eliminated by removing the pjsip/aor/<aor> serializer and
	  continuing the processing in the pjsip/distributor serializer.  Now any
	  retransmissions queued in the pjsip/distributor serializer will be
	  processed after the first message is completely processed.

	* taskprocessors: Implement high/low water mark alerts.

	  When taskprocessors get backed up, there is a good chance that we are
	  being overloaded and need to defer adding new work to the system.

	  * Implemented a high/low water alert mechanism for modules to check if the
	  system is being overloaded and take appropriate action.  When a
	  taskprocessor is created it has default congestion levels set.  A
	  taskprocessor can later have those congestion levels altered for specific
	  needs if stress testing shows that the taskprocessor is a symptom of
	  overloading or needs to handle bursty activity without triggering an
	  overload alert.

	  * Add CLI "core show taskprocessor" low/high water columns.

	  * Fixed __allocate_taskprocessor() to not use RAII_VAR().  RAII_VAR() was
	  never a good thing to use when creating a taskprocessor because of the
	  nature of how its references needed to be cleaned up on a partial
	  creation.

	  is active before placing a message representing brand new work onto a

	* res_odbc: Implement a connection pool.

	  Testing has shown that our usage of UnixODBC is problematic
	  due to bugs within UnixODBC itself as well as the heavy weight
	  cost of connecting and disconnecting database connections, even
	  when pooling is enabled.

	  For users of UnixODBC 2.3.1 and earlier crashes would occur due
	  to insufficient protection of the disconnect operation. This was
	  fixed in UnixODBC 2.3.2 and above.

	  For users of UnixODBC 2.3.3 and higher a slow-down would occur
	  under heavy database use due to repeated connection establishment.
	  A regression is present where on each connection the database
	  configuration is cached again, with the cache growing out of
	  control.

	  The connection pool implementation present in this change helps
	  to mitigate these issues by reducing how much we connect and
	  disconnect database connections. We also solve the issue of
	  crashes under UnixODBC 2.3.1 by defaulting the maximum number of
	  connections to 1, returning us to the previous working behavior.
	  For users who may have a fixed version the maximum concurrent
	  connection limit can be increased helping with performance.

	  The connection pool works by keeping a list of active connections.
	  If the connection limit has not been reached a new connection is
	  established. If the connection limit has been reached then the
	  request waits until a connection becomes available before
	  continuing.

	* ari/resource_channels:  Add 'formats' to channel create/originate

	  If you create a local channel and don't specify an originator channel
	  to take capabilities from, we automatically add all audio formats to
	  the new channel's capabilities. When we try to make the channel
	  compatible with another, the "best format" functions pick the best
	  format available, which in this case will be slin192.  While this is
	  great for preserving quality, it's the worst for performance and
	  overkill for the vast majority of applications.

	  In the absense of any other information, adding all formats is the
	  correct thing to do and it's not always possible to supply an
	  originator so a new parameter 'formats' has been added to the channel
	  create/originate functions. It's just a comma separated list of formats
	  to make availalble for the channel. Example: "ulaw,slin,slin16".
	  'formats' and 'originator' are mutually exclusive.

	  To facilitate determination of format names, the format name has been
	  added to "core show codecs".

	* res_pjsip: Match dialogs on responses better.

	  When receiving an incoming response to a dialog-starting INVITE, we were
	  not matching the response to the INVITE dialog. Since we had not
	  recorded the to-tag to the dialog structure, the PJSIP-provided method
	  to find the dialog did not match.

	  Most of the time, this was not a problem, because there is a fall-back
	  that makes the response get routed to the same serializer that the
	  request was sent on. However, in cases where an asynchronous DNS lookup
	  occurs in the PJSIP core, the thread that sends the INVITE is not
	  actually a threadpool serializer thread. This means we are unable to
	  record a serializer to handle the incoming response.

	  Now, imagine what happens when an INVITE is sent on a non-serialized
	  thread, and an error response (such as a 486) arrives. The 486 ends up
	  getting put on some random threadpool thread. Eventually, a hangup task
	  gets queued on the INVITE dialog serializer. Since the 486 is being
	  handled on a different thread, the hangup task can execute at the same
	  time that the 486 is being handled. The hangup task assumes that it is
	  the sole owner of the INVITE session and channel, so it ends up
	  potentially freeing the channel and NULLing the session's channel
	  pointer. The thread handling the 486 can crash as a result.

	  This change has the incoming response match the INVITE transaction, and
	  then get the dialog from that transaction. It's the same method we had
	  been using for matching incoming CANCEL requests. By doing this, we get
	  the INVITE dialog and can ensure that the 486 response ends up being
	  handled by the same thread as the hangup, ensuring that the hangup runs
	  after the 486 has been completely handled.

	* udptl:  Don't eat sequence numbers until OK is received

	  Scenario:
	  Local fax -> Asterisk w/ firewall -> Provider -> Remote fax

	  * Local fax starts rtp call to remote fax
	  * Remote fax starts t38 call back to local fax.
	  * Local fax sends t38 no-signal to Asterisk before sending an OK.
	  * udptl processes the frame and increments the expected sequence number.
	  * chan_sip drops the frame because the call isn't up so nothing goes out
	    the external interface to open the port for incoming packets.
	  * Local fax sends OK and Asterisk sends OK to the remote fax.
	  * Remote fax sends t38 packets which are dropped by the firewall.
	  * Local fax re-sends t38 no-signal with the same sequence number.
	  * udptl drops the frame because it thinks it's a dup.
	  * Still no outgoing packets to open the firewall.
	  * t38 negotiation fails.

	  The patch drops frames t38 received before udptl sequence processing
	  when the call hasn't been answered yet.  The second no-signal frame
	  is then seen as new and is relayed out the external interface which
	  opens the port and allows negotiation to continue.

	  We can't specifically tell the stack to send only 1 message per packet, but we

	* res_hep: Provide an option to pick the UUID type

	  At one point in time, it seemed like a good idea to use the Asterisk
	  channel name as the HEP correlation UUID. In particular, it felt like
	  this would be a useful identifier to tie PJSIP messages and RTCP
	  messages together, along with whatever other data we may eventually send
	  to Homer. This also had the benefit of keeping the correlation UUID
	  channel technology agnostic.

	  In practice, it isn't as useful as hoped, for two reasons:
	  1) The first INVITE request received doesn't have a channel. As a
	     result, there is always an 'odd message out', leading it to be
	     potentially uncorrelated in Homer.
	  2) Other systems sending capture packets (Kamailio) use the SIP Call-ID.
	     This causes RTCP information to be uncorrelated to the SIP message
	     traffic seen by those capture nodes.

	  In order to support both (in case someone is trying to use res_hep_rtcp
	  with a non-PJSIP channel), this patch adds a new option, uuid_type, with
	  two valid values - 'call-id' and 'channel'. The uuid_type option is used
	  by a module to determine the preferred UUID type. When available, that
	  source of a correlation UUID is used; when not, the more readily available
	  source is used.

	  For res_hep_pjsip:
	   - uuid_type = call-id: the module uses the SIP Call-ID header value
	   - uuid_type = channel: the module uses the channel name if available,
	                          falling back to SIP Call-ID if not
	  For res_hep_rtcp:
	   - uuid_type = call-id: the module uses the SIP Call-ID header if the
	                          channel type is PJSIP and we have a channel,
	                          falling back to the Stasis event provided
	                          channel name if not
	   - uuid_type = channel: the module uses the channel name

	* Use doubles instead of floats for conversions when comparing strings.

	  In 13.9.0, there was an issue where PJSIP contacts added to an AOR would
	  be deleted at seemingly random times.

	  One reason this was happening was because of an operation to retrieve
	  the contacts whose expiration time was less than or equal to the current
	  time. When retrieving existing contacts, the contact's expiration time
	  and the current time were converted from a string to a float, and those
	  two floats were compared.

	  On some systems, including mine, this conversion was horribly off. For
	  instance, I could regularly see the string "1463079214" get converted
	  into 1463079168.000000. When switching from using a float to using a
	  double, the conversion was as expected.

	  Why was the conversion to float off? My best guess is that the
	  conversion to float was attempting to store the entire value in the 23
	  bit significand of the IEEE-754 floating point number. In particular, if
	  you take only the 23 most significant bits of 1463079214, you get the
	  messed up 1463079168 that we were seeing in the conversion. It likely
	  was possible to get a more precise value by composing the number using
	  an exponent, but the conversion did not work that way. With a double,
	  you have a 52 bit significand, allowing the entire value to fit there,
	  and thereby allowing an accurate conversion.

	  There are two types of SIP URIs indicating a secure transport:

	  When using a sips URI, Asterisk checks incoming INVITEs and answers from

	  the pjsip client ever being initialized. This fix checks to make sure there is
	  a client to destroy before attempting.

	* res_pjsip_authenticator_digest: Don't use source port in nonce verification

	  From the issue reporter:
	  "res_pjsip_outbound_authenticator_digest builds a nonce that is a hash of
	  the timestamp, the source address, the source port, a server UUID that is
	  calculated at startup, and the authentication realm.

	  Rather than caching nonces that we create, we instead attempt to re-calculate
	  the nonce when receiving an incoming request with authentication. We then
	  compare the re-calculated nonce to the incoming nonce, and if they don't match,
	  then authentication has failed early.

	  The problem is that it is possible, especially when using TCP, to receive two
	  requests from the same endpoint but have differing source ports for those
	  requests. Asterisk itself commonly will use different source ports for
	  outbound TCP requests."

	  This patch removes the source port dependency when building the nonce.

	* config_transport:  Tell pjproject to allow all SSL/TLS protocols

	  The default tls settings for pjproject only allow TLS 1, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.
	  SSL is not allowed.   So, even if you specify "sslv3" for a transport method,
	  it's silently ignored and one of the TLS protocols is used.  This was a new
	  behavior of pjsip_tls_setting_default() in 2.4 (when tls.proto was added) that
	  we never caught.

	  Now we need to set tls.proto = 0 after we call pjsip_tls_setting_default().
	  This tells pjproject to set the socket protocol to match the method.

	  * Added a patch to pjproject to take the name of the 'make' command from
	    an environment variable if supplied.  This is needed for the python bindings.
	    (merged by Teluu into pjproject trunk 5/3/2016)
	  FreeBSD support isn't complete.  Still some general issues regarding
	  make/gmake having nothing to do with pjproject.  With some handholding it DOES
	  build successfully.

	  CentOS:
	  Added 'patch' and 'bzip2' to install_prereq PACKAGES_RH.

	* res_pjsip:  Add ability to identify by Authorization username

	  A feature of chan_sip that service providers relied upon was the ability to
	  identify by the Authorization username.  This is most often used when customers
	  have a PBX that needs to register rather than identify by IP address.  From my
	  own experiance, this is pretty common with small businesses who otherwise
	  don't need a static IP.

	  In this scenario, a register from the customer's PBX may succeed because From
	  will usually contain the PBXs account id but an INVITE will contain the caller
	  id.  With nothing recognizable in From, the service provider's Asterisk can
	  never match to an endpoint and the INVITE just stays unauthorized.

	  The fixes:

	  A new value "auth_username" has been added to endpoint/identify_by that
	  will use the username and digest fields in the Authorization header
	  instead of username and domain in the the From header to match an endpoint,
	  or the To header to match an aor.  This code as added to
	  res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_user rather than creating a new module.

	  Although identify_by was always a comma-separated list, there was only
	  1 choice so order wasn't preserved.  So to keep the order, a vector was added
	  to the end of ast_sip_endpoint.  This is only used by res_pjsip_registrar
	  to find the aor.  The res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_* modules are called in
	  globals/endpoint_identifier_order.

	  Along the way, the logic in res_pjsip_registrar was corrected to match
	  most-specific to least-specific as res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_user does.

	  The order is:

	  username@domain
	  username@domain_alias
	  username

	  Auth by username does present 1 problem however, the first INVITE won't have
	  an Authorization header so the distributor, not finding a match on anything,
	  sends a securty_alert.  It still sends a 401 with a challenge so the next
	  INVITE will have the Authorization header and presumably succeed.  As a result
	  though, that first security alert is actually a false alarm.

	  To address this, a new feature has been added to pjsip_distributor that keeps
	  track of unidentified requests and only sends the security alert if a
	  configurable number of unidentified requests come from the same IP in a
	  configurable amout of time.  Those configuration options have been added to
	  the global config object.  This feature is only used when auth_username
	  is enabled.

	  Finally, default_realm was added to the globals object to replace the hard
	  coded "asterisk" used when an endpoint is not yet identified.

	  The testsuite tests all pass but new tests are forthcoming for this new
	  feature.

	  A patch I did back in 2014 modified ast_config_text_file_save2 to check the

	  This patch causes ast_config_text_file_save2 to check the writability of the
	  parent directory of missing files instead of checking the file itself.  This
	  allows missing files to be created again.  A unit test was also added to
	  test_config to test saving of config files.

	* res_pjsip:  Add serialized scheduler (res_pjsip/pjsip_scheduler.c)

	  There are several places that do scheduled tasks or periodic housecleaning,
	  each with its own implementation:

	  * res_pjsip_keepalive has a thread that sends keepalives.
	  * pjsip_distributor has a thread that cleans up expired unidentified requests.
	  * res_pjsip_registrar_expire has a thread that cleans up expired contacts.
	  * res_pjsip_pubsub uses ast_sched directly and then calls ast_sip_push_task.
	  * res_pjsip_sdp_rtp also uses ast_sched to send keepalives.

	  There are also places where we should be doing scheduled work but aren't.
	  A good example are the places we have sorcery observers to start registration
	  or qualify.  These don't work when changes are made to a backend database
	  without a pjsip reload.  We need to check periodically.

	  As a first step to solving these issues, a new ast_sip_sched facility has
	  been created.

	  ast_sip_sched wraps ast_sched but only uses ast_sched as a scheduled queue.
	  When a task is ready to run, ast_sip_task_pusk is called for it. This ensures
	  that the task is executed in a PJLIB registered thread and doesn't hold up the
	  ast_sched thread so it can immediately continue processing the queue.  The
	  serializer used by ast_sip_sched is one of your choosing or a random one from
	  the res_pjsip pool if you don't choose one.

	  Another feature is the ability to automatically clean up the task_data when the
	  task expires (if ever).  If it's an ao2 object, it will be dereferenced, if
	  it's a malloc'd object it will be freed.  This is selectable when the task is
	  scheduled.  Even if you choose to not auto dereference an ao2 task data object,
	  the scheduler itself maintains a reference to it while the task is under it's
	  control.  This prevents the data from disappearing out from under the task.

	  There are two scheduling models.

	  AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_PERIODIC specifies that the invocations of the task occur at
	  the specific interval.  That is, every "interval" milliseconds, regardless of
	  how long the task takes.  If the task takes longer than the interval, it will
	  be scheduled at the next available multiple of interval.  For exmaple: If the
	  task has an interval of 60 secs and the task takes 70 secs (it better not),
	  the next invocation will happen at 120 seconds.

	  AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_DELAY specifies that the next invocation of the task should
	  start "interval" milliseconds after the current invocation has finished.

	  Also, the same ast_sched facility for fixed or variable intervals exists.  The
	  task's return code in conjunction with the AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_FIXED or
	  AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_VARIABLE flags controls the next invocation start time.

	  One res_pjsip.h housekeeping change was made.  The pjsip header files were
	  added to the top.  There have been a few cases lately where I've needed
	  res_pjsip.h just for ast_sip calls and had compiles fail spectacularly because
	  I didn't add the pjsip header files to my source even though I never referenced
	  any pjsip calls.

	  Finally, a few new convenience APIs were added to astobj2 to make things a
	  little easier in the scheduler.  ao2_ref_and_lock() calls ao2_ref() and
	  ao2_lock() in one go.  ao2_unlock_and_unref() does the reverse. A few macros
	  were also copied from res_phoneprov because I got tired of having to duplicate
	  the same hash, sort and compare functions over and over again. The
	  AO2_STRING_FIELD_(HASH|SORT|CMP)_FN macros will insert functions suitable for
	  aor_container_alloc into your source.

	  This facility can be used immediately for the situations where we already have
	  a thread that wakes up periodically or do some scheduled work.  For the
	  registration and qualify issues, additional sorcery and schema changes would
	  need to be made so that we can easily detect changed objects on a periodic
	  basis without having to pull the entire database back to check.  I'm thinking
	  of a last-updated timestamp on the rows but more on this later.

	* res_agi:  Prevent run_agi from eating frames it shouldn't

	  The run_agi function is eating control frames when it shouldn't be. This is
	  causing issues when an AGI is run from CONNECTED_LINE_SEND_SUB in a blond
	  transfer.

	  Alice calls Bob. Bob attended transfers to Charlie but hangs up before Charlie
	  answers.

	  Alice gets the COLP UPDATE indicating Charlie but Charlie never gets an UPDATE
	  and is left thinking he's connected to Bob.

	  In this case, when CONNECTED_LINE_SEND_SUB runs on Alice's channel and it calls
	  an AGI, the extra eaten frames prevent CONNECTED_LINE_SEND_SUB from running on
	  Charlie's channel.

	  The fix was to accumulate deferrable frames in the "forever" loop instead of
	  dropping them, and re-queue them just before running the actual agi command
	  or exiting.

	* func_odbc: Use one connection per DSN.

	  res_odbc was changed in Asterisk 13.8.0 to remove connection management,
	  opting instead to let unixodbc maintain open connections and return
	  those to Asterisk as requested.

	  This was a boon for realtime, since it meant that multiple threads could
	  potentially run parallel queries since they could each be using their
	  own database connections.

	  However, on the user-facing side, func_odbc, there were some inherent
	  behaviors being relied on that no longer hold true after the change.
	  One such reported behavior was that MySQL's LAST_INSERTED_ID() works
	  per-connection. This means that if Asterisk uses separate connections
	  for every database operation, whereas before it used one connection for
	  everything, we have broken expectations and functionality.

	  The fix provided in this patch is to make func_odbc use a single
	  database connection per DSN. This way, user-facing database usage will
	  have the same behavior as it did pre-13.8.0. However, realtime, which is
	  the real workhorse of database interaction, will continue to let
	  unixodbc manage connections.

	* res_stasis: Handle re-enter stasis bridge with swap channel.

	  We lose the fact that there is a swap channel if there is one.  We
	  currently wind up rejoining the stasis bridge as a normal join after the
	  swap channel has already been kicked from the bridge.

	  This patch preserves the swap channel so the AMI/ARI events can note that
	  the channel joining the bridge is swapping with another channel.  Another
	  benefit to swaqpping in one operation is if there are any channels that
	  get lonely (MOH, bridge playback, and bridge record channels).  The lonely
	  channels won't leave before the joining channel has a chance to come back
	  in under stasis if the swap channel is the only reason the lonely channels
	  are staying in the bridge.

	* bridge: Hold off more than one imparting channel at a time.

	  An earlier patch blocked the ast_bridge_impart() call until the channel
	  either entered the target bridge or it failed.  Unfortuantely, if the
	  target bridge is stasis and the imprted channel is not a stasis channel,
	  stasis bounces the channel out of the bridge to come back into the bridge
	  as a proper stasis channel.  When the channel is bounced out, that
	  released the block on ast_bridge_impart() to continue.  If the impart was
	  a result of a transfer, then it became a race to see if the swap channel
	  would get hung up before the imparted channel could come back into the
	  stasis bridge.  If the imparted channel won then everything is fine.  If
	  the swap channel gets hung up first then the transfer will fail because
	  the swap channel is leaving the bridge.

	  * Allow a chain of ast_bridge_impart()'s to happen before any are
	  unblocked to prevent the race condition described above.  When the channel
	  finally joins the bridge or completely fails to join the bridge then the
	  ast_bridge_impart() instances are unblocked.

	* res_pjsip_callerid:  Clear out display name if id->name is not valid

	  When create_new_id_hdr creates a new RPID or PAI header, it starts by cloning
	  the From header, then it overwrites the display name and uri from the channel's
	  connected.id.  If the connected.id.name wasn't valid, create_new_id_hdr was
	  leaving the display name from the From header in the new RPID or PAI header.
	  On an attended transfer where the originator had a caller id number set but not
	  a display name, the re-INVITE to the final transferee had the number of the
	  originator but the display name of the transferer.

	  Added a check to clear out the display name in the new header if

	* PJSIP: Remove PJSIP parsing functions from uri length validation.

	  The PJSIP parsing functions provide a nice concise way to check the
	  length of a hostname in a SIP URI. The problem is that in order to use
	  those parsing functions, it's required to use them from a thread that
	  has registered with PJLib.

	  On startup, when parsing AOR configuration, the permanent URI handler
	  may not be run from a PJLib-registered thread. Specifically, this could
	  happen when Asterisk was started in daemon mode rather than
	  console-mode. If PJProject were compiled with assertions enabled, then
	  this would cause Asterisk to crash on startup.

	  The solution presented here is to do our own parsing of the contact URI
	  in order to ensure that the hostname in the URI is not too long. The
	  parsing does not attempt to perform a full SIP URI parse/validation,
	  since the hostname in the URI is what is important.

	* res_pjsip_registrar: Fix bad memory-ness with user_agent.

	  Recent changes to the PJSIP registrar resulted in tests failing due to
	  missing AOR_CONTACT_ADDED test events. The reason for this was that the
	  user_agent string had junk values in it, resulting in being unable to
	  generate the event.

	  I'm going to be honest here, I have no idea why this was happening. Here
	  are the steps needed for the user_agent variable to get messed up:
	  * REGISTER is received
	  * First contact in the REGISTER results in a contact being removed
	  * Second contact in the REGISTER results in a contact being added
	  * The contact, AOR, expiration, and user agent all have to be passed as
	    format parameters to the creation of a string. Any subset of those
	    parameters would not be enough to cause the problem.

	  Looking into what was happening, the thing that struck me as odd was
	  that the user_agent variable was meant to be set to the value of the
	  User-Agent SIP header in the incoming REGISTER. However, when removing a
	  contact, the user_agent variable would be set (via ast_strdupa inside a
	  loop) to the stored contact's user_agent. This means that the
	  user_agent's value would be incorrect when attempting to process further
	  contacts in the incoming REGISTER.

	  The fix here is to use a different variable for the stored user agent
	  when removing a contact. Correcting the behavior to be correct also
	  means the memory usage is less weird, and the issue no longer occurs.

	* pjproject:  Add patch for removing strip of '[]' from header params

	  From the patch submitted to Teluu on 4/12/2016
	  <<<<<<<<<
	  The wholesale stripping of '[]' from header parameters causes issues if
	  something (like a port) occurs after the final ']'.

	  '[2001:a::b]' will correctly parse to '2001:a::b'
	  '[2001:a::b]:8080' will correctly parse to '2001:a::b' but the scanner is left
	  with ':8080' and parsing stops with a syntax error.

	  I can't even find a case where stripping the '[]' is a good thing anyway.  Even
	  if you continued to parse and resulted in a string that looks like this...
	  '2001:a::b:8080', it's not valid.

	  This came up in Asterisk because Kamailio sends us a Contact with an alias
	  URI parameter that has an IPv6 address in it like this:
	  Contact: <sip:1171@127.0.0.1:5080;alias=[2001:1:2::3]~43691~6>
	  which should be legal but causes a syntax error because of the characters
	  after the final ']'.  Even if it didn't, the '[]' should still not be stripped.

	  I've run the Asterisk Test Suite for PJSIP (252 tests) many of which are IPv6
	  enabled.  No issues were caused by removing the code that strips the '[]'.

	  The test_voicemail_notify_endl test checks the end-of-line

	  would go outside of the buffer and access other memory causing

	* res_pjsip contact:  Lock expiration/addition of contacts

	  Contact expiration can occur in several places:  res_pjsip_registrar,
	  res_pjsip_registrar_expire, and automatically when anyone calls
	  ast_sip_location_retrieve_aor_contact.  At the same time, res_pjsip_registrar
	  may also be attempting to renew or add a contact.  Since none of this was locked
	  it was possible for one thread to be renewing a contact and another thread to
	  expire it immediately because it was working off of stale data.  This was the
	  casue of intermittent registration/inbound/nominal/multiple_contacts test
	  failures.

	  Now, the new named lock functionality is used to lock the aor during contact
	  expire and add operations and res_pjsip_registrar_expire now checks the
	  expiration with the lock held before deleting the contact.

	* lock:  Add named lock capability

	  Locking some objects like sorcery objects can be tricky because the underlying
	  ao2 object may not be the same for all callers.  For instance, two threads that
	  call ast_sorcery_retrieve_by_id on the same aor name might actually get 2
	  different ao2 objects if the underlying wizard had to rehydrate the aor from a
	  database. Locking one ao2 object doesn't have any effect on the other even if
	  those objects had locks in the first place.

	  Named locks allow access control by keyspace and key strings.  Now an "aor"
	  named "1000" can be locked and any other thread attempting to lock "aor" "1000"
	  will wait regardless of whether the underlying ao2 object is the same or not.
	  Mutex and rwlocks are supported.

	  This capability will initially be used to lock an aor when multiple threads may
	  be attempting to prune expired contacts from it.

	* res_pjsip: Handle deferred SDP hold/unhold properly.

	  Some SIP devices indicate hold/unhold using deferred SDP reinvites. In
	  other words, they provide no SDP in the reinvite.

	  A typical transaction that starts hold might look something like this:

	  * Device sends reinvite with no SDP
	  * Asterisk sends 200 OK with SDP indicating sendrecv on streams.
	  * Device sends ACK with SDP indicating sendonly on streams.

	  At this point, PJMedia's SDP negotiator saves Asterisk's local state as
	  being recvonly.

	  Now, when the device attempts to unhold, it again uses a deferred SDP
	  reinvite, so we end up doing the following:

	  * Device sends reinvite with no SDP
	  * Asterisk sends 200 OK with SDP indicating recvonly on streams
	  * Device sends ACK with SDP indicating sendonly on streams

	  The problem here is that Asterisk offered recvonly, and by RFC 3264's
	  rules, if an offer is recvonly, the answer has to be sendonly. The
	  result is that the device is not taken off hold.

	  What is supposed to happen is that Asterisk should indicate sendrecv in
	  the 200 OK that it sends. This way, the device has the freedom to
	  indicate sendrecv if it wants the stream taken off hold, or it can
	  continue to respond with sendonly if the purpose of the reinvite was
	  something else (like a session timer refresher).

	  The fix here is to alter the SDP negotiator's state when we receive a
	  reinvite with no SDP. If the negotiator's state is currently in the
	  recvonly or inactive state, then we alter our local state to be
	  sendrecv. This way, we allow the device to indicate the stream state as
	  desired.

	* config:  Allow filters when appending to a category

	  In sorcery based config files where there are multiple categories with the same
	  name, you can't use the (+) operator to reliably append to a category because
	  config.c stops looking when it finds the first one with the same name.

	  Example:

	  [1000]
	  type = endpoint

	  [1000]
	  type = aor

	  [1000](+)
	  authenticate_qualify = yes

	  This config will fail because config.c appends authenticate_qualify to the
	  first category it finds, the endpoint, and that's not valid for endpoint.

	  Solution:

	  The capability to find a category that contains a certain variable already
	  exists so the only real change was to parse anything after the '+' that's not a
	  comma, as a filter string.

	  [1000]
	  type = endpoint

	  [1000]
	  type = aor

	  [1000](+type=aor)
	  authenticate_qualify = yes

	  This now works as expected.

	  Although the following example doesn't make any sense for pjsip, you can even
	  specify multiple filters:

	  [1000](+type=aor&qualify_frequency=10)

	* stringfields:  Refactor to allow fields to be added to the end of structures

	  String fields are great, except that you can't add new ones without breaking
	  ABI compatibility because it shifts down everything else in the structure.
	  The only alternative is to add your own char * field to the end of the
	  structure and manage the memory yourself which isn't ideal, especially since
	  you then can't use the OPT_STRINGFIELD_T type.

	  Background:

	  The reason string fields had to be declared inside the
	  AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS block was to facilitate iteration over all declared
	  fields for initialization, compare and copy.  Since AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS
	  declared the pool, then the fields, then the manager, you could use the offsets
	  of the pool and manager and iterate over the sequential addresses in between to
	  access the fields. The actual pool, field allocation and field set operations
	  don't actually care where the field is.  It's just iteration over the fields
	  that was the problem.

	  Solution: Extended String Fields

	  An extended string field is one that is declared outside the
	  AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS block but still (anywhere) inside the parent
	  structure.  Other than using AST_STRING_FIELD_EXTENDED instead of
	  AST_STRING_FIELD, it looks the same as other string fields.  It's storage comes
	  from the pool and it participates in string field compare and copy operations
	  peformed on the parent structure. It's also a valid target for the
	  OPT_STRINGFIELD_T aco option type.

	  Implementation:

	  To keep track of the extended fields and make sure that ABI isn't broken, the
	  existing embedded_pool pointer in the manager structure was repurposed to be a
	  pointer to a separate header structure that contains the embedded_pool pointer
	  plus a vector of fields.  The length of the manager structure didn't change and
	  the embedded_pool pointer isn't used in the macros, only the stringfields C
	  code.  A side benefit of this is that changing the header structure in the
	  future won't break ABI.

	  ast_string_fields_init initializes the normal string fields and appends them to
	  the vector, and subsequent calls to ast_string_field_init_extended initialize
	  and append the extended fields. Cleanup, ast_string_fields_cmp, and
	  ast_string_fields_copy can now work on the vector instead of sequentially
	  traversing the addresses between the pool and manager.

	  The total size of a structure using string fields didn't change, whether using
	  extended fields or not, nor have the offsets of any structure members, either
	  inside the original block or outside.  Adding an extended field to the end of a
	  structure is the same as adding a char *.

	  Details:

	  The stringfield C code was pulled out from utils.c and into stringfields.c.
	  It just made sense.

	  Additional work was done in ast_string_field_init and
	  ast_calloc_with_stringfields to handle the allocation of the new header
	  structure and the vector, and the associated cleanup.  In the process some
	  additional NULL pointer checking was added.

	  A lot of work was done in stringfields.h since the logic for compare and copy
	  is there.  Documentation was added as well as somne additional NULL checking.

	  The ability to call ast_calloc_with_stringfields with a number of structures
	  greater than 1 never really worked.  Well, the calloc worked but there was no
	  way to access the additional structures or clean them up.  It was agreed that
	  there was no use case for requesting more than 1 structure so an ast_assert
	  was added to prevent it and the iteration code removed.

	  Testing:

	  The stringfield unit tests were updated to test both normal and extended
	  fields.  Tests for ast_string_field_ptr_set_by_fields and
	  ast_calloc_with_stringfields were also added.

	  As an ABI test, 13 was compiled from git and the res_pjsip_* modules, except
	  res_pjsip itself, saved off.  The patch was then added and a full compile and
	  install was performed.  Then the older res_pjsip_* moduled were copied over the
	  installed versions so res_pjsip was new and the rest were old.  No issues.

	  contact->aor, which is a char * at the end of contact, was then changed to an
	  extended string field and a recompile and reinstall was performed, again
	  leaving stock versions of the the res_pjsip_* modules.  Again, no issues with
	  the res_pjsip_* modules using the old stringfield implementation and with
	  contact->aor as a char *, and res_pjsip itself using the new stringfield
	  implementation and contact->aor being an extended string field.

	  Finally, several existing string fields were converted to extended string
	  fields to test OPT_STRINGFIELD_T.  Again, no issues.

	* res_stasis: Add control ref to playback and recording structs.

	  The stasis_app_playback and stasis_app_recording structs need to have a
	  struct stasis_app_control ref.  Other threads can get a reference to the
	  playback and recording structs from their respective global container.
	  These other threads can then use the control pointer they contain after
	  the control struct has gone.

	  * Add control ref to stasis_app_playback and stasis_app_recording structs.

	  With the refs added, the control command queue can now have a circular
	  control reference which will cause the control struct to never get
	  released if the control's command queue is not flushed when the channel
	  leaves the Stasis application.  Also the command queue needs better
	  protection from adding commands if the control->is_done flag is set.

	  * Flush the control command queue on exit.

	* res_pjsip_mwi:  Allow subscribe to vm access extension as an alias

	  Background:

	  If your extension is 1000 and the voicemail access extension is 1571 and you
	  dial 1571, usually a dialplan rule calls voicemailmain with your extension and
	  you are placed directly in your mailbox.  Therefore most admins program the
	  voicemail (or other speed dial) button on their phones to the access extension.
	  Some phones (Snom at least) use whatever is programmed there to also subscribe
	  for MWI and so can't dial one number and subscribe to another.  This works fine
	  in chan_sip because chan_sip completely ignores the user portion of the
	  SUBSCRIBE message request URI.  If it can match the peer, is subscribes to the
	  peer's mailbox.  The user could be set to anything or nothing and you'd still
	  get subscribed to your mailbox.

	  Issue:

	  chan_pjsip actually uses the user portion of the URI to find an aor and its
	  mailboxes.  Therefore a subscribe to 1571 results in a 404.  Sure, you can
	  create an aor for 1571 but you certainly can't add your entire voicemail
	  system's mailboxes to it and everyone would get notified of every MWI.

	  Solution:

	  When an MWI subscribe comes in and an aor can't be found that matches the
	  resource directly, check the resource against the endpoint's aors.  If an aor
	  is found that has a voicemail_extension that matches the resource, use it.

	* res_pjsip_mwi:  Add voicemail extension and mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited

	  res_pjsip_mwi was missing the chan_sip "vmexten" functionality which adds
	  the Message-Account header to the MWI NOTIFY.  Also, specifying mailboxes
	  on endpoints for unsolicited mwi and on aors for subscriptions required
	  that the admin know in advance which the client wanted.  If you specified
	  mailboxes on the endpoint, subscriptions were rejected even if you also
	  specified mailboxes on the aor.

	  Voicemail extension:
	  * Added a global default_voicemail_extension which defaults to "".
	  * Added voicemail_extension to both endpoint and aor.
	  * Added ast_sip_subscription_get_dialog for support.
	  * Added ast_sip_subscription_get_sip_uri for support.

	  When an unsolicited NOTIFY is constructed, the From header is parsed, the
	  voicemail extension from the endpoint is substituted for the user, and the
	  result placed in the Message-Account field in the body.

	  When a subscribed NOTIFY is constructed, the subscription dialog local uri
	  is parsed, the voicemail_extension from the aor (looked up from the
	  subscription resource name) is substituted for the user, and the result
	  placed in the Message-Account field in the body.

	  If no voicemail extension was defined, the Message-Account field is not added
	  to the NOTIFY body.

	  mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited:
	  * Added mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited to endpoint.

	  The previous behavior was to reject a subscribe if a previous internal
	  subscription for unsolicited MWI was found for the mailbox.  That remains the
	  default.  However, if there are mailboxes also set on the aor and the client
	  subscribes and mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited is set, the existing internal
	  subscription is removed and replaced with the external subscription.  This
	  allows an admin to configure mailboxes on both the endpoint and aor and allows
	  the client to select which to use.

	  Commit 1bce690ccb36a4744a327c07af23a9a3a0fa20cd was incrementing txcount
	  for rtcp packets as well as rtp packets and that was causing sender reports

	* res_pjsip/pjsip_options:  Fix From generation on outgoing OPTIONS

	  No one seemed to notice but every time an OPTIONS goes out, it goes
	  out with a From of "asterisk" (or whatever the default from_user is set to),
	  even if you specify an endpoint.

	  The issue had several causes...
	  qualify_contact is only called with an endpoint if called from the CLI.
	  If the endpoint is NULL, qualify_contact only looks up the endpoint if
	  authenticate_qualify=yes. Even then, it never passes it on to
	  ast_sip_create_request where the From header is set.  Therefore From
	  is always "asterisk" (or whatever the default from_user is set to).
	  Even if ast_sip_create_request were to get an endpoint, it only sets
	  the From if endpoint->from_user is set.

	  The fix is 4 parts...

	  First, create_out_of_dialog_request was modified to use the endpoint id
	  if endpoint was specified and from_user is not set.

	  Second, qualify_contact was modified to always look up an endpoint if
	  one wasn't specified regardless of authenticate_qualify.  It then passes
	  the endpoint on to create_out_of_dialog_request.

	  Third (and most importantly), find_an_endpoint was modified to find
	  an endpoint by using an "aors LIKE %contact->aor%" predicate with
	  ast_sorcery_retrieve_by_fields.  As such, this patch will only work
	  if the sorcery realtime optimizations patch goes in.  Otherwise we'd
	  be pulling the entire endpoints database every time we send an OPTIONS.
	  Since we already know the contact's aor, the on_endpoint callback was also
	  modified to just check if the contact->aor is an exact match to one of
	  the endpoint's.

	  Finally, since we now have an endpoint for every OPTIONS request,
	  res_pjsip/endpt_send_request (which handles out-of-dialog reqests) was
	  updated to get the transport from the endpoint and set it on tdata.
	  Now the correct transport is used.

	* res_parking: Fix blind transfer dynamic lots creation.

	  Blind transfers to a recognized parking extension need to use the parker's
	  channel variable values to create the dynamic parking lot.  This is
	  because there is always only one parker while the parkee may actually be a
	  multi-party bridge.  A multi-party bridge can never supply the needed
	  channel variables to create the dynamic parking lot.  In the multi-party
	  bridge blind transfer scenario, the parker's CHANNEL(parkinglot) value and
	  channel variables are inherited by the local channel used to park the
	  bridge.

	  * In park_common_setup(), make use the parker instead of the parkee to
	  supply the dynamic parking lot channel variable values.  In all but one
	  case, the parkee is the same as the parker.  However, in the recognized
	  parking extension blind transfer scenario for a two party bridge they are
	  different channels.  For consistency, we need to use the parker channel.

	  * In park_local_transfer(), pass the CHANNEL(parkinglot) value to the
	  local channel when blind transferring a multi-party bridge to a recognized
	  parking extension.

	  * When a local channel starts a call, the Local;2 side needs to inherit
	  the CHANNEL(parkinglot) value from Local;1.

	  The DTMF one-touch parking case wasn't even trying to create dynamic
	  parking lots before it aborted the attempt.

	  * In parking_park_call(), add missing code to create a dynamic parking
	  lot.

	  A DTMF bridge hook is documented as returning -1 to remove the hook.
	  Though the hook caller is really coded to accept non-zero.  See the
	  ast_bridge_hook_callback typedef.

	  * In feature_park_call(), don't remove the DTMF one-touch parking hook
	  because of an error.

	* sorcery/res_pjsip:  Refactor for realtime performance

	  There were a number of places in the res_pjsip stack that were getting
	  all endpoints or all aors, and then filtering them locally.

	  A good example is pjsip_options which, on startup, retrieves all
	  endpoints, then the aors for those endpoints, then tests the aors to see
	  if the qualify_frequency is > 0.  One issue was that it never did
	  anything with the endpoints other than retrieve the aors so we probably
	  could have skipped a step and just retrieved all aors. But nevermind.

	  This worked reasonably well with local config files but with a realtime
	  backend and thousands of objects, this was a nightmare.  The issue
	  really boiled down to the fact that while realtime supports predicates
	  that are passed to the database engine, the non-realtime sorcery
	  backends didn't.

	  They do now.

	  The realtime engines have a scheme for doing simple comparisons. They
	  take in an ast_variable (or list) for matching, and the name of each
	  variable can contain an operator.  For instance, a name of
	  "qualify_frequency >" and a value of "0" would create a SQL predicate
	  that looks like "where qualify_frequency > '0'".  If there's no operator
	  after the name, the engines add an '=' so a simple name of
	  "qualify_frequency" and a value of "10" would return exact matches.

	  The non-realtime backends decide whether to include an object in a
	  result set by calling ast_sorcery_changeset_create on every object in
	  the internal container.  However, ast_sorcery_changeset_create only does
	  exact string matches though so a name of "qualify_frequency >" and a
	  value of "0" returns nothing because the literal "qualify_frequency >"
	  doesn't match any name in the objset set.

	  So, the real task was to create a generic string matcher that can take a
	  left value, operator and a right value and perform the match. To that
	  end, strings.c has a new ast_strings_match(left, operator, right)
	  function.  Left and right are the strings to operate on and the operator
	  can be a string containing any of the following: = (or NULL or ""), !=,
	  >, >=, <, <=, like or regex.  If the operator is like or regex, the
	  right string should be a %-pattern or a regex expression.  If both left
	  and right can be converted to float, then a numeric comparison is
	  performed, otherwise a string comparison is performed.

	  To use this new function on ast_variables, 2 new functions were added to
	  config.c.  One that compares 2 ast_variables, and one that compares 2
	  ast_variable lists.  The former is useful when you want to compare 2
	  ast_variables that happen to be in a list but don't want to traverse the
	  list.  The latter will traverse the right list and return true if all
	  the variables in it match the left list.

	  Now, the backends' fields_cmp functions call ast_variable_lists_match
	  instead of ast_sorcery_changeset_create and they can now process the
	  same syntax as the realtime engines.  The realtime backend just passes
	  the variable list unaltered to the engine.  The only gotcha is that
	  there's no common realtime engine support for regex so that's been noted
	  in the api docs for ast_sorcery_retrieve_by_fields.

	  Only one more change to sorcery was done...  A new config flag
	  "allow_unqualified_fetch" was added to reg_sorcery_realtime.
	  "no": ignore fetches if no predicate fields were supplied.
	  "error": same as no but emit an error. (good for testing)
	  "yes": allow (the default);
	  "warn": allow but emit a warning. (good for testing)

	  Now on to res_pjsip...

	  pjsip_options was modified to retrieve aors with qualify_frequency > 0
	  rather than all endpoints then all aors.  Not only was this a big
	  improvement in realtime retrieval but even for config files there's an
	  improvement because we're not going through endpoints anymore.

	  res_pjsip_mwi was modified to retieve only endpoints with something in
	  the mailboxes field instead of all endpoints then testing mailboxes.

	  res_pjsip_registrar_expire was completely refactored.  It was retrieving
	  all contacts then setting up scheduler entries to check for expiration.
	  Now, it's a single thread (like keepalive) that periodically retrieves
	  only contacts whose expiration time is < now and deletes them.  A new
	  contact_expiration_check_interval was added to global with a default of
	  30 seconds.

	  Ross Beer reports that with this patch, his Asterisk startup time dropped
	  from around an hour to under 30 seconds.

	  There are still objects that can't be filtered at the database like
	  identifies, transports, and registrations.  These are not going to be
	  anywhere near as numerous as endpoints, aors, auths, contacts however.

	  Back to allow_unqualified_fetch.  If this is set to yes and you have a
	  very large number of objects in the database, the pjsip CLI commands
	  will attempt to retrive ALL of them if not qualified with a LIKE.
	  Worse, if you type "pjsip show endpoint <tab>" guess what's going to
	  happen? :)  Having a cache helps but all the objects will have to be
	  retrieved at least once to fill the cache.  Setting
	  allow_unqualified_fetch=no prevents the mass retrieve and should be used
	  on endpoints, auths, aors, and contacts.  It should NOT be used for
	  identifies, registrations and transports since these MUST be
	  retrieved in bulk.

	  Example sorcery.conf:

	  [res_pjsip]
	  endpoint=config,pjsip.conf,criteria=type=endpoint
	  endpoint=realtime,ps_endpoints,allow_unqualified_fetch=error

	* Restrict CLI/AMI commands on shutdown.

	  The log message when a MusicOnHold music class was not found was changed
	  from debug level to WARNING level in Asterisk 11.19 and 13.5.  For those
	  using realtime musiconhold, this message is wrong because it warns
	  before checking the database.

	  This changeset delays the warning until after the database has been
	  checked.

	* core/logging: Fix broken syslog levels on older glibc.

	  The fix to ASTERISK-25407 introduced the usage of LOG_MAKEPRI. However
	  this macro is broken in older glibc (< 2.17); it would left-shift the
	  facility a second time, causing the resultant priority to become
	  invalid.

	  The syslog manpage mentions nothing about LOG_MAKEPRI and suggests this:

	      The priority argument is formed by ORing the facility and the level
	      values [...].

	* res_pjsip_registrar: Fix bad memory-ness with user_agent.

	  Recent changes to the PJSIP registrar resulted in tests failing due to
	  missing AOR_CONTACT_ADDED test events. The reason for this was that the
	  user_agent string had junk values in it, resulting in being unable to
	  generate the event.

	  I'm going to be honest here, I have no idea why this was happening. Here
	  are the steps needed for the user_agent variable to get messed up:
	  * REGISTER is received
	  * First contact in the REGISTER results in a contact being removed
	  * Second contact in the REGISTER results in a contact being added
	  * The contact, AOR, expiration, and user agent all have to be passed as
	    format parameters to the creation of a string. Any subset of those
	    parameters would not be enough to cause the problem.

	  Looking into what was happening, the thing that struck me as odd was
	  that the user_agent variable was meant to be set to the value of the
	  User-Agent SIP header in the incoming REGISTER. However, when removing a
	  contact, the user_agent variable would be set (via ast_strdupa inside a
	  loop) to the stored contact's user_agent. This means that the
	  user_agent's value would be incorrect when attempting to process further
	  contacts in the incoming REGISTER.

	  The fix here is to use a different variable for the stored user agent
	  when removing a contact. Correcting the behavior to be correct also
	  means the memory usage is less weird, and the issue no longer occurs.

	  At shutdown it is possible for modules to be unloaded that wouldn't
	  normally be unloaded. This allows the environment to be cleaned up.

	  The res_pjsip_transport_management module did not have the unload
	  logic in it to clean itself up causing the res_pjsip module to not
	  get unloaded. As a result the res_pjsip monitor thread kept going
	  processing traffic and timers when it shouldn't.

	* PJSIP: Remove PJSIP parsing functions from uri length validation.

	  The PJSIP parsing functions provide a nice concise way to check the
	  length of a hostname in a SIP URI. The problem is that in order to use
	  those parsing functions, it's required to use them from a thread that
	  has registered with PJLib.

	  On startup, when parsing AOR configuration, the permanent URI handler
	  may not be run from a PJLib-registered thread. Specifically, this could
	  happen when Asterisk was started in daemon mode rather than
	  console-mode. If PJProject were compiled with assertions enabled, then
	  this would cause Asterisk to crash on startup.

	  The solution presented here is to do our own parsing of the contact URI
	  in order to ensure that the hostname in the URI is not too long. The
	  parsing does not attempt to perform a full SIP URI parse/validation,
	  since the hostname in the URI is what is important.

	  shut down the TCP connection.

	* chan_pjsip: transfers with direct media reinvite has wrong address/port

	  During a transfer involving direct media a race occurs between when the
	  transferer channel is swapped out, initiating rtp changes/updates, and the
	  subsequent reinvites.

	  When Alice, after speaking with Charlie (Bob is on hold), connects Bob and
	  Charlie invites are sent to each in order to establish the call between them.
	  Bob is taken off hold and Charlie is told to have his media flow through
	  Asterisk. However, if before those invites go out the bridge updates Bob's
	  and/or Charlie's rtp information with direct media data (i.e. address, port)
	  then the invite(s) will contain the remote data in the SDP instead of the
	  Asterisk data.

	  The race occurs in the native bridge glue code when updating the peer. The
	  direct_media_address can get set twice before sending out the first invite
	  during call connection. This can happen because the checking/setting of the
	  direct_media_address happened in one thread while the sending of the invite(s)
	  happened in another thread.

	  This fix removes the race condition by moving the checking/setting of the
	  direct_media_address to be in the same thread as the sending of the invites(s).
	  This serializes the checking/setting and sending so they can no longer happen
	  out of order.

	  This patch is part of a series to resolve deadlocks in chan_sip.c.

	  Stopping a scheduled event can result in a deadlock if the scheduled event
	  is running when you try to stop the event.  If you hold a lock needed by
	  the scheduled event while trying to stop the scheduled event then a
	  deadlock can happen.  The general strategy for resolving the deadlock
	  potential is to push the actual starting and stopping of the scheduled
	  events off onto the scheduler/do_monitor() thread by scheduling an
	  immediate one shot scheduled event.  Some restructuring may be needed
	  because the code may assume that the start/stop of the scheduled events is

	  This patch is part of a series to resolve deadlocks in chan_sip.c.

	  Delaying destruction of the chan_sip sip_pvt structures caused the
	  /channels/chan_sip/test_sip_rtpqos unit test to crash.  That test
	  registers a special test ast_rtp_engine with the rtp engine module.  When
	  the unit test completes it cleans up by unregistering the test
	  ast_rtp_engine and exits.  Since the delayed destruction of the sip_pvt
	  happens after the unit test returns, the destructor tries to call the rtp
	  engine destroy callback of the test ast_rtp_engine auto variable which no
	  longer exists on the stack.

	  * Change the test ast_rtp_engine auto variable to a static variable.  Now
	  the variable can still exist after the unit test exits so the delayed
	  sip_pvt destruction can complete successfully.

	* build_system:  Split COMPILE_DOUBLE from DONT_OPTIMIZE

	  I can't ever recall actually needing the intermediate files or the checking
	  that a double compile produces.  What I CAN remember is every DONT_OPTIMIZE
	  build needing 3 invocations of gcc instead of 1 just to do the checks and
	  produce those intermediate files.

	  Having said that, Richard pointed out that the reason for the double compile
	  was that there were cases in the past where a submitted patch failed to compile
	  because the submitter never tried it with the optimizations turned on.

	  To get the best of both worlds, COMPILE_DOUBLE has been split into its own
	  option.  If DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned on, COMPILE_DOUBLE will also be selected
	  BUT you can then turn it off if all you need are the debugging symbols.  This
	  way you have to make an informed decision about disabling COMPILE_DOUBLE.

	  To allow COMPILE_DOUBLE to be both auto-selected and turned off, a new feature
	  was added to menuselect.  The <use> element can now contain an "autoselect"
	  attribute which will turn the used member on but not create a hard dependency.
	  The cflags.xml implementation for COMPILE_DOUBLE looks like this...

	  <member name="DONT_OPTIMIZE" displayname="Disable Optimizations ...">
	  	<use autoselect="yes">COMPILE_DOUBLE</use>
	  	<support_level>core</support_level>
	  </member>
	  <member name="COMPILE_DOUBLE" displayname="Pre-compile with ...>
	  	<depend>DONT_OPTIMIZE</depend>
	  	<support_level>core</support_level>
	  </member>

	  When DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned on, COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned on because
	  of the use.
	  When DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned off, COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned off because
	  of the depend.
	  When COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned on, DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned on because
	  of the depend.
	  When COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned off, DONT_OPTIMIZE is left as is because
	  it only uses COMPILE_DOUBLE, it doesn't depend on it.

	  I also made a few tweaks to the ncurses implementation to move things
	  left a bit to allow longer descriptions.

	* app_chanspy: Fix occasional deadlock with ChanSpy and Local channels.

	  Channel masquerading had a conflict with autochannel locking.

	  When locking autochannel->channel, the channel is fetched from the
	  autochannel and then locked. During the fetch, the autochannel -- which
	  has no locks itself -- can be modified by someone who owns the channel
	  lock. That means that the value of autochan->channel cannot be trusted
	  until you hold the lock.

	  In practice, this caused problems with Local channels getting
	  masqueraded away while the ChanSpy attempted to get info from that
	  channel. The old channel which was about to get removed got locked, but
	  the new (replaced) channel got unlocked (no-op). Because the replaced
	  channel was now locked (and would never get unlocked), it couldn't get
	  removed from the channel list in a timely manner, and would now cause
	  deadlocks when iterating over the channel list.

	  This change checks the autochannel after locking the channel for changes
	  to the autochannel. If the channel had been changed, the lock is
	  reobtained on the new channel.

	  In theory it seems possible that after this fix, the lock attempt on the
	  old (wrong) channel can be on an already destroyed lock, maybe causing
	  a crash. But that hasn't been observed in the wild and is harder induce
	  than the current deadlock.

	  Thanks go to Filip Frank for suggesting a fix similar to this and
	  especially to IRC user hexanol for pointing out why this deadlock was
	  possible and testing this fix. And to Richard for catching my rookie
	  while loop mistake ;)

	* loader: Retry dlopen when loading fails

	  Although we use the RTLD_LAZY flag when calling dlopen
	  the first time on a module, this only defers resolution
	  for function calls.  Pointer references to functions are
	  determined at link time so dlopen expects them to be there.
	  Since we don't cross-module link, pointers to functions
	  in other modules won't be available and dlopen will fail.

	  Doing a "hardened" build also causes problems because it
	  typically sets "-z now" on the ld command line which
	  overrides RTLD_LAZY at run time.

	  If the failing module isn't a GLOBAL_SYMBOLS module, then
	  dlopen will be called again after all the GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
	  modules have been loaded and they'll eventually resolve.

	  If the calling module IS a GLOBAL_SYMBOLS module itself
	  and a third module depends on it, then there's an issue
	  because the second time through the dlopen loop,
	  GLOBAL_SYMBOLS modules aren't given any special treatment
	  and since the order in which dlopen is called isn't
	  deterministic, the dependent may again be tried before the
	  module it needs is loaded.

	  Simple solution:  Save modules that fail load_resource
	  because of a dlopen error in a list and retry them
	  immediately after the first pass. Keep retrying until
	  the failed list is empty or we reach a #defined max
	  retries. Error messages are suppressed until the final
	  pass which also gets rid of those confusing error messages
	  about module failures that are later corrected.

	* bridge.c: Crash during attended transfer when missing a local channel half

	  It's possible for the transferer channel to get hung up early during the
	  attended transfer process. For instance, a phone may send a "bye" immediately
	  upon receiving a sip notify that contains a sip frag 100 (I'm looking at you
	  Jitsi). When this occurs a race begins between the transferer being hung up
	  and completion of the transfer code.

	  If the channel hangs up too early during a transfer involving stasis bridging
	  for instance, then when the created local channel goes to look up its swap
	  channel (and associated datastore) it can't find it (since it is no longer in
	  the bridge) thus it fails to enter the stasis application. Consequently, the
	  created local channel(s) hang up as well. If the timing is just right then the
	  bridging code attempts to add the message link with missing local channel(s).
	  Hence the crash.

	  Unfortunately, there is no great way to solve the problem of the unexpected
	  "bye". While we can't guarantee we won't receive an early hangup, and in this
	  case still fail to enter the stasis application, we can make it so asterisk
	  does not crash.

	  This patch does just that by locking the local channel structure, checking
	  that the local channel's peer has not been lost, and then continuing. This
	  keeps the local channel's peer from being ripped out from underneath it by
	  the local/unreal hangup code while attempting to set the stasis message link.

	* res_pjsip_refer.c: Delay sending the initial SIP Notify with frag 100

	  During the transfer process, some phones (okay it was the Jitsi softphone,
	  but maybe others are out there) send a "bye" immediately after receiving a
	  SIP Notify. When a "bye" is received early for some types of transfers the
	  transferer channel may no longer be available during late stage transfer
	  processing.

	  For instance, during an attended transfer involving stasis bridging at one
	  point the created local channel looks for an associated swap channel in
	  order to retrieve the stasis application name. If the transferer has hung
	  up then the local channel will fail to find it. The local channel then has
	  no way to know which stasis app to enter, so it fails and hangs up as well.
	  Thus the transfer does not complete as expected.

	  This patch delays the sending of the initial notify in order to give the
	  transfer process enough time to gather the necessary data for a successful
	  transfer.

	* alembic: Fix downgrade and tweak for sqlite

	  Downgrade had a few issues.  First there was an errant 'update' statement in
	  add_auto_dtmf_mode that looks like it was a copy/paste error.  Second, we
	  weren't cleaning up the ENUMs so subsequent upgrades on postgres failed
	  because the types already existed.

	  For sqlite...  sqlite doesn't support ALTER or DROP COLUMN directly.
	  Fortunately alembic batch_operations takes care of this for us if we
	  use it so the alter and drops were converted to use batch operations.

	  Here's an example downgrade:

	      with op.batch_alter_table('ps_endpoints') as batch_op:
	          batch_op.drop_column('tos_audio')
	          batch_op.drop_column('tos_video')
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('tos_audio', yesno_values))
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('tos_video', yesno_values))
	          batch_op.drop_column('cos_audio')
	          batch_op.drop_column('cos_video')
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('cos_audio', yesno_values))
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('cos_video', yesno_values))

	      with op.batch_alter_table('ps_transports') as batch_op:
	          batch_op.drop_column('tos')
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('tos', yesno_values))
	      # Can't cast integers to YESNO_VALUES, so dropping and adding is required
	          batch_op.drop_column('cos')

	* config_transport:  Fix objects returned by ast_sip_get_transport_states

	  ast_sip_get_transport_states was returning a container of internal_state
	  objects instead of ast_sip_transport_state objects.  This was causing
	  transport lookups to fail, most noticably in res_pjsip_nat, which
	  couldn't find the correct external addresses.  This was causing contacts
	  to go out with internal ip addresses.

	* SIP diversion: Fix REDIRECTING(reason) value inconsistencies.

	  Previous chan_sip behavior:

	  Before this patch chan_sip would always strip any quotes from an incoming
	  reason and pass that value up as the REDIRECTING(reason).  For an outgoing
	  reason value, chan_sip would check the value against known values and
	  quote any it didn't recognize.  Incoming 480 response message reason text
	  was just assigned to the REDIRECTING(reason).

	  Previous chan_pjsip behavior:

	  Before this patch chan_pjsip would always pass the incoming reason value
	  up as the REDIRECTING(reason).  For an outgoing reason value, chan_pjsip
	  would send the reason value as passed down.

	  With this patch:

	  Both channel drivers match incoming reason values with values documented
	  by REDIRECTING(reason) and values documented by RFC5806 regardless of
	  whether they are quoted or not.  RFC5806 values are mapped to the
	  equivalent REDIRECTING(reason) documented value and is set in
	  REDIRECTING(reason).  e.g., an incoming RFC5806 'unconditional' value or a
	  quoted string version ('"unconditional"') is converted to
	  REDIRECTING(reason)'s 'cfu' value.  The user's dialplan only needs to deal
	  with 'cfu' instead of any of the aliases.

	  The incoming 480 response reason text supported by chan_sip checks for
	  known reason values and if not matched then puts quotes around the reason
	  string and assigns that to REDIRECTING(reason).

	  Both channel drivers send outgoing known REDIRECTING(reason) values as the
	  unquoted RFC5806 equivalent.  User custom values are either sent as is or
	  with added quotes if SIP doesn't allow a character within the value as
	  part of a RFC3261 Section 25.1 token.  Note that there are still
	  limitations on what characters can be put in a custom user value.  e.g.,
	  embedding quotes in the middle of the reason string is silly and just
	  going to cause you grief.

	  * Setting a REDIRECTING(reason) value now recognizes RFC5806 aliases.
	  e.g., Setting REDIRECTING(reason) to 'unconditional' is converted to the
	  'cfu' value.

	  * Added missing malloc() NULL return check in res_pjsip_diversion.c
	  set_redirecting_reason().

	  * Fixed potential read from a stale pointer in res_pjsip_diversion.c
	  add_diversion_header().  The reason string needed to be copied into the
	  tdata memory pool to ensure that the string would always be available.
	  Otherwise, if the reason string returned by reason_code_to_str() was a
	  user's reason string then the string could be freed later by another
	  thread.

	* build-system: Allow building with static pjproject

	  Background here:
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2016-January/075266.html

	  From CHANGES:
	   * To help insure that Asterisk is compiled and run with the same known
	     version of pjproject, a new option (--with-pjproject-bundled) has been
	     added to ./configure.  When specified, the version of pjproject specified
	     in third-party/versions.mak will be downloaded and configured.  When you
	     make Asterisk, the build process will also automatically build pjproject
	     and Asterisk will be statically linked to it.  Once a particular version
	     of pjproject is configured and built, it won't be configured or built
	     again unless you run a 'make distclean'.

	     To facilitate testing, when 'make install' is run, the pjsua and pjsystest
	     utilities and the pjproject python bindings will be installed in
	     ASTDATADIR/third-party/pjproject.

	     The default behavior remains building with the shared pjproject
	     installation, if any.

	  Building:

	     All you have to do is include the --with-pjproject-bundled option on
	     the ./configure command line (and remove any existing --with-pjproject
	     option if specified).  Everything else is automatic.

	  Behind the scenes:

	     The top-level Makefile was modified to include 'third-party' in the
	     list of MOD_SUBDIRS.

	     The third-party directory was created to contain any third party
	     packages that may be needed in the future.  Its Makefile automatically
	     iterates over any subdirectories passing on targets.

	     The third-party/pjproject directory was created to house the pjproject
	     source distribution.  Its Makefile contains targets to download, patch
	     configure, generate dependencies, compile libs, apps and python bindings,
	     sanitized build.mak and generate a symbols list.

	     When bootstrap.sh is run, it automatically includes the configure.m4
	     file in third-party/pjproject.  This file has a macro to download and
	     conifgure pjproject and get and set PJPROJECT_INCLUDE, PJPROJECT_DIR
	     and PJPROJECT_BUNDLED.  It also tests for the capabilities like
	     PJ_TRANSACTION_GRP_LOCK by parsing preprocessor output as opposed to
	     trying to compile.  Of course, bootstrap.sh is only run once and the
	     configure file is incldued in the patch.

	     When configure is run with the new options, the macro in configure.m4
	     triggers the download, patch, conifgure and tests.  No compilation is
	     performed at this time.  The downloaded tarball is cached in /tmp so
	     it doesn't get downloaded again on a distclean.

	     When make is run in the top-level Asterisk source directory, it will
	     automatically descend all the subdirectories in third_party just as it
	     does for addons, apps, etc.  The top-level Makefile makes sure that
	     the 'third-party' is built before 'main' so that dependencies from the
	     other directories are built first.

	     When main does build, a new shared library (libasteriskpj) is created that
	     links statically to the pjproject .a files and exports all their symbols.
	     The asterisk binary links to that, just as it does with libasteriskssl.

	     When Asterisk is installed, the pjsua and pjsystest apps, and the pjproject
	     python bindings are installed in ASTDATADIR/third-party/pjproject.  This
	     will facilitate testing, including running the testsuite which will be
	     updated to check that directory for the pjsua module ahead of the system
	     python library.

	  Modules should continue to depend on pjproject if they use pjproject APIs
	  directly.  They should not care about the implementation.  No changes to any
	  res_pjsip modules were made.

	* chan_sip.c: Fix T.38 issues caused by leaving a bridge.

	  chan_sip could not handle AST_T38_TERMINATED frames being sent to it when
	  the channel left the bridge.  The action resulted in overlapping outgoing
	  reINVITEs.  The testsuite tests/fax/sip/directmedia_reinvite_t38 was not
	  happy.

	  * Force T.38 to be remembered as locally bridged.  Now when the channel
	  leaves the native RTP bridge after T.38, the channel remembers that it has
	  already reINVITEed the media back to Asterisk.  It just needs to terminate
	  T.38 when the AST_T38_TERMINATED arrives.

	  * Prevent redundant AST_T38_TERMINATED from causing problems.  Redundant
	  AST_T38_TERMINATED frames could cause overlapping outgoing reINVITEs if
	  they happen before the T.38 state changes to disabled.  Now the T.38 state
	  is set to disabled before the reINVITE is sent.

	  that it puts into the bridge may or may not be processed by the time the
	  bridged peer is kicked out of the bridge.  If it is processed then all is
	  well.  However, if it is not processed then that channel is stuck in fax
	  mode until it hangs up or maybe if it joins another bridge for T.38
	  faxing.

	* bridge_channel: Don't settle owed events on an optimization.

	  Local channel optimization could cause DTMF digits to be duplicated.
	  Pending DTMF end events would be posted to a bridge when the local channel
	  optimizes out and is replaced by the channel further down the chain.  When
	  the real digit ends, the channel would get another DTMF end posted to the
	  bridge.

	  A -- LocalA;1/n -- LocalA;2/n -- LocalB;1 -- LocalB;2 -- B

	  1) LocalA has the /n flag to prevent optimization.
	  2) B is sending DTMF to A through the local channel chain.
	  3) When LocalB optimizes out it can move B to the position of LocalB;1
	  4) Without this patch, when B swaps with LocalB;1 then LocalB;1 would
	  settle an owed DTMF end to the bridge toward LocalA;2.
	  5) When B finally ends its DTMF it sends the DTMF end down the chain.
	  6) Without this patch, A would hear the DTMF digit end when LocalB
	  optimizes out and when B ends the original digit.

	* sorcery:  Refactor create, update and delete to better deal with caches

	  The ast_sorcery_create, update and delete function have been refactored
	  to better deal with caches and errors.

	  The action is now called on all non-caching wizards first. If ANY succeed,
	  the action is called on all caching wizards and the observers are notified.
	  This way we don't put something in the cache (or update or delete) before
	  knowing the action was performed in at least 1 backend and we only call the
	  observers once even if there were multiple writable backends.

	  ast_sorcery_create was never adding to caches in the first place which
	  was preventing contacts from getting added to a memory_cache when they
	  were created.  In turn this was causing memory_cache to emit errors if
	  the contact was deleted before being retrieved (which would have
	  populated the cache).

	* res_pjsip/config_transport: Allow reloading transports.

	  The 'reload' mechanism actually involves closing the underlying

	  to reset the transport before sending requests to insure that the
	  pjsip transport didn't get pulled out from under them.

	  In my testing, no calls were dropped when a transport was changed
	  for any of the 3 transport types even if ip addresses or ports were
	  changed. To be on the safe side however, a new transport option was
	  added (allow_reload) which defaults to 'no'.  Unless it's explicitly
	  set to 'yes' for a transport, changes to that transport will be ignored
	  on a reload of res_pjsip.  This should preserve the current behavior.

	* res_pjproject:  Add ability to map pjproject log levels to Asterisk log levels

	  Warnings and errors in the pjproject libraries are generally handled by
	  Asterisk.  In many cases, Asterisk wouldn't even consider them to be warnings
	  or errors so the messages emitted by pjproject directly are either superfluous
	  or misleading.  A good exampe of this are the level-0 errors pjproject emits
	  when it can't open a TCP/TLS socket to a client to send an OPTIONS.  We don't
	  consider a failure to qualify a UDP client an "ERROR", why should a TCP/TLS
	  client be treated any differently?

	  A config file for res_pjproject has bene added (pjproject.conf) and a new
	  log_mappings object allows mapping pjproject levels to Asterisk levels
	  (or nothing).  The defaults if no pjproject.conf file is found are the same
	  as those that were hard-coded into res_pjproject initially: 0,1 = LOG_ERROR,
	  2 = LOG_WARNING, 3,4,5 = LOG_DEBUG<level>

	* Fix failing threadpool_auto_increment test.

	  The threadpool_auto_increment test fails infrequently for a couple of
	  reasons
	  * The threadpool listener was notified of fewer tasks being pushed than
	    were actually pushed
	  * The "was_empty" flag was set to an unexpected value.

	  The problem is that the test pushes three tasks into the threadpool.
	  Test expects the threadpool to essentially gather those three tasks, and
	  then distribute those to the threadpool threads. It also expects that as
	  the tasks are pushed in, the threadpool listener is alerted immediately
	  that the tasks have been pushed. In reality, a task can be distributed
	  to the threadpool threads quicker than expected, meaning that the
	  threadpool has already emptied by the time each subsequent task is
	  pushed. In addition, the internal threadpool queue can be delayed so
	  that the threadpool listener is not alerted that a task has been pushed
	  even after the task has been executed.

	  From the test's point of view, there's no way to be able to predict
	  exactly the order that task execution/listener notifications will occur,
	  and there is no way to know which listener notifications will indicate
	  that the threadpool was previously empty.

	  For this reason, the test has been updated to only check the things it
	  can check. It ensures that all tasks get executed, that the threads go
	  idle after the tasks are executed, and that the listener is told the
	  proper number of tasks that were pushed.

	* res_pjsip_caller_id: Fix segfault when replacing rpid or pai header

	  If the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function adds a PAI or RPID header and send_rpid
	  or send_pai is set, res_pjsip_caller_id attemps to retrieve, parse and modify
	  the header added by the dialplan function.  Since the header added by the
	  dialplan function is generic string, there are no virtual functions to parse
	  the uri and we get a segfault when we try.  Since the modify, was really only
	  an overwrite, we now just delete the old header if it was type PJSIP_H_OTHER
	  and recreate it.

	  This raises a question for another time though:  What should happen with
	  duplicate headers?  Right now res_pjsip_header_funcs doesn't check for dups
	  so if it's session supplement is loaded after res_pjsip_caller_id's (or any
	  other module that adds headers), there'll be dups in the message.

	* Fix creation race of contact_status structures.

	  It is possible when processing a SIP REGISTER request to have two
	  threads end up creating contact_status structures in sorcery.
	  contact_status is created using a "find or create" function. If two
	  threads call into this at the same time, each thread will fail to find
	  an existing contact_status, and so both will end up creating a new
	  contact status.

	  During testing, we would see sporadic failures because the
	  PJSIP_CONTACT() dialplan function would operate on a different
	  contact_status than what had been updated by res_pjsip/pjsip_options.

	  The fix here is two-fold:
	  1) The "find or create" function for contact_status now has a lock
	  around the entire operation. This way, if two threads attempt the
	  operation simultaneously, the first to get there will create the object,
	  and the second will find the object created by the first thread.

	  2) res_sorcery_memory has had its create callback updated so that it
	  will not allow for objects with duplicate IDs to be created.

	* tests/test_sorcery_memory_cache_thrash: Improve termination process.

	  When terminating the threads thrashing a sorcery memory cache each
	  would be told to stop and then we would wait on them. During at
	  least one thrashing test this was problematic due to the specific
	  usage pattern in use. It would take some time for termination of the
	  thread to occur.

	  This would occur due to contention between the threads retrieving
	  and the threads updating the cache. As the retrieving threads are
	  given priority it may be some time before the updating threads
	  are able to proceed.

	  This change makes it so all threads are told to stop and then each
	  are joined to ensure they stop. This way all the threads should
	  stop at around the same time instead of waiting for one to stop,
	  the next to stop, then the next, and so on. As a result of this
	  the execution time for each thrash test is much closer to their
	  expected value than previously seen as well.

	* res_pjsip:  Fix infinite recursion when loading transports from realtime

	  Attempting to load a transport from realtime was forcing asterisk into an
	  infinite recursion loop.  The first thing transport_apply did was to do a
	  sorcery retrieve by id for an existing transport of the same name. For files,
	  this just returns the previous object from res_sorcery_config's internal
	  container, if any.  For realtime, the res_sourcery_realtime driver looks in the
	  database and finds the existing row but now it has to rehydrate it into a
	  sorcery object which means calling... transport_apply.  And so it goes.

	  The main issue with loading from realtime (apart from the loop) was that
	  transport stores structures and pointers directly in the ast_sip_transport
	  structure instead of the separate ast_transport_state structure.  This patch
	  separates those items into the ast_sip_transport_state structure.  The pattern
	  is roughly the same as res_pjsip_outbound_registration.

	  Although all current usages of ast_sip_transport and ast_sip_transport_state
	  were modified to use the new ast_sip_get_transport_state API, the original
	  items are left in ast_sip_transport and kept updated to maintain ABI
	  compatability for third-party modules.  They are marked as deprecated and
	  noted that they're now in ast_sip_transport_state.

	* res_odbc: Remove connection management

	  Asterisk by default will create a single database connection and share
	  it among all threads that attempt to access the database. In previous
	  versions of Asterisk, this was tolerable, because the most used channel
	  driver, chan_sip, mostly accessed the database from a single thread.
	  With PJSIP, however, many threads may be attempting to perform database
	  operations, and there is the potential for many more database accesses,
	  meaning the concurrency is a horrible bottleneck if only one connection
	  is shared.

	  Asterisk has a connection pooling facility built into it, but the
	  implementation has flaws. For one, there is a strict limit on the number
	  of simultaneous connections that could be made to the database. Anything
	  beyond the maximum would result in a failed operation. Attempting to
	  predict what the maximum should be is nearly impossible even for someone
	  intimately familiar with Asterisk's threading model. In addition, use of
	  transactions in the dialplan can cause some severe bugs if connection
	  pooling is enabled.

	  This commit seeks to fix the concurrency problem by removing all
	  connection management code from Asterisk and leaving that to the
	  underlying unixODBC code instead. Now, Asterisk does not share a single
	  connection, nor does it try to maintain a connection pool. Instead, all
	  Asterisk ever does is request a connection from unixODBC and allow
	  unixODBC to either allocate those connections or retrieve them from a
	  pool.

	  Doing this has a bit of a ripple effect. For one, since connections are
	  not long-lived objects, several of the safeguards that previously
	  existed have been removed. We don't have to worry about trying to use a
	  connection that has gone stale. In every case, when we request a
	  connection, it has just been made and we don't need to perform any
	  sanity checks to be sure it's still active.

	  Another major player affected by this change is transactions.
	  Transactions and their respective connections were so tightly coupled
	  that it was almost pornographic. This code change moves
	  transaction-related code to its own file separate from the core ODBC
	  functionality. This way, the core of ODBC does not even have to know
	  that transactions exist.

	  In making this large change, I had to look at a lot of code and
	  understand it. When making this change, I discovered several places
	  where the behavior is definitely not ideal, but it seemed outside the
	  scope of this change to be fixing it. Instead, any place where I saw
	  some sort of room for improvement has had a XXX comment added explaining
	  what could be altered to improve it.

	* build_system: Prevent goals needing makeopts from running when it's missing

	  The Makefile only optionally includes makeopts so when goals like uninstall that
	  dont depend on anything else are run after a distclean, rules like
	  'rm -f "$(DESTDIR)$(ASTMODDIR)/"*' get run as 'rm -f ""/*' which attempts
	  to remove everything in the root directory.

	  Although there's a rule defined for makeopts which prints a message and does
	  an 'exit 1', since '-include makepopts' was specified (with the -), the exit
	  was ignored letting the rest of the rules run.

	  This patch makes makeopts required unless the goal has the string 'clean' in it.

	* config: Allow options to register when documentation is unavailable.

	  The config options framework is strict in that configuration options must
	  be documented unless XML documentation support is not available. In
	  practice this is useful as it ensures documentation exists however in
	  off-nominal cases this can cause strange problems.

	  If it is expected that a config option has a non-zero or non-empty
	  default value but the config option documentation is unavailable
	  this reasonable expectation will not be met. This can cause obscure
	  crashes and weirdness depending on how the code handles it.

	  This change tweaks the behavior to ensure that the config option
	  is still allowed to register, apply default values, and be set when
	  devmode is not enabled. If devmode is enabled then the option can
	  NOT be set.

	  This also does not remove the initial documentation error message that
	  is output on load when registering the configuration option.

	* Stasis: Use custom structure when setting variables.

	  A recent change to queue channel variable setting to the Stasis control
	  queue caused a regression. When setting channel variables, it is
	  possible to give a NULL channel variable value in order to unset the
	  variable (i.e. remove it from the channel variable list). The change
	  introduced a call to ast_variable_new(), which is not tolerant of NULL
	  channel variable values.

	  This new change switches from using ast_variable to using a custom
	  channel variable struct that is lighter weight and NULL value-tolerant.

	  A test recently uncovered that running an ill-timed AMI command to show

	  The fix for this is to remove the subscription tree from the list of

	* Stasis: Fix potential memory leak of control data.

	  When queuing tasks onto the Stasis control queue, you can pass an
	  arbitrary data pointer and a function to free that data. All ARI
	  commands that use the Stasis control queue made the assumption that the
	  destructor function would be called in all paths, whether the task was
	  queued successfully or not. However, this was not correct. If a task was
	  queued onto a control structure that was already completed, the
	  allocated data would not be freed properly.

	  This patch corrects this by making sure that all return paths call the
	  data destructor.

	* Stasis: Use control queue to prevent crash.

	  A crash occurred when attempting to set a channel variable on a channel
	  that had already been hung up. This is because there is a small window
	  between when a control is grabbed and when the channel variable is set
	  that the channel can be hung up.

	  The fix here is to queue the setting of the channel variable onto the
	  control queue. This way, the manipulation of the channel happens in a
	  thread where it is safe to be done.

	  In this change, I also noticed that the setting of bridge roles on
	  channels was being done outside of the control queue, so I also changed
	  those operations to be done in the control queue.

	* funcs/func_cdr: Correctly report high precision values for duration and billsec

	  When CDRs were refactored, func_cdr's ability to report high precision values
	  for duration and billsec (the 'f' option) was broken. This was due to func_cdr
	  incorrectly interpreting the duration/billsec values provided by the CDR engine
	  in milliseconds, as opposed to seconds. Since the CDR engine only provides
	  duration and billsec in seconds, and does not expose either attribute with
	  sufficient precision to merely pass back the underlying value, this patch fixes
	  the bug by re-calculating duration and billsec with microsecond precision based
	  on the start/answer/end times on the CDR.

	  The initial use case is retrieving the runtime value of

	  than pjproject can handle.  Since it can differ between
	  the version of pjproject that Asterisk was compiled against
	  and the version of pjproject that Asterisk is running against,
	  we can't use the PJ_MAX_HOSTNAME macro directly in Asterisk

	* app: Queue hangup if channel is hung up during sub or macro execution.

	  This issue was exposed when executing a connected line subroutine.
	  When connected or redirected subroutines or macros are executed it is
	  expected that the underlying applications and logic invoked are fast
	  and do not consume frames. In practice this constraint is not enforced
	  and if not adhered to will cause channels to continue when they shouldn't.
	  This is because each caller of the connected or redirected logic does not
	  check whether the channel has been hung up on return. As a result the
	  the hung up channel continues.

	  This change makes it so when the API to execute a subroutine or
	  macro is invoked the channel is checked to determine if it has hung up.
	  If it has then a hangup is queued again so the caller will see it

	* res_musiconhold: Prevent multiple simultaneous reloads.

	  There are two ways in which the reload() function in res_musiconhold can be
	  called from the CLI:

	    * module reload res_musiconhold.so
	    * moh reload

	  In the former case, the module loader holds a lock that prevents multiple
	  concurrent calls, but in the latter there is no such protection.

	  This patch changes the 'moh reload' CLI command to invoke the module loader
	  directly, rather than call reload() explicitly.

	* res_sorcery_realtime: Remove leading ^ requirement.

	  res_sorcery_realtime's search-by-regex callback performed a check to
	  ensure that the passed-in regex began with a caret (^). If it did not,
	  then no results would be returned.

	  This callback only started to become used when "like" support was added
	  to PJSIP CLI commands. The CLI command for listing objects would pass an
	  empty regex ("") to the sorcery backend if no "like" statement was
	  present. For most sorcery backends, this resulted in returning all
	  objects. However, for realtime, this resulted in returning no objects.

	  This commit seeks to fix the regression by removing the requirement from
	  res_sorcery_realtime for the passed-in-regex to begin with a caret.

	* pjsip_sdp_rtp:  Add option endpoint/bind_rtp_to_media_address

	  On a system with multiple ip addresses in the same subnet, if a
	  transport is bound to a specific ip address and endpoint/media_address
	   is set, the SIP/SDP will have the correct address in all fields but
	  the rtp stream MAY still originate from one of the other ip addresses,
	  most probably the "primary" ip address.  This happens because
	   res_pjsip_sdp_rtp/create_rtp always calls ast_instance_new with
	  the "all" ip address (0.0.0.0 or ::).

	  The new option causes res_pjsip_sdp_rtp/create_rtp to call
	  ast_rtp_instance_new with the endpoint's media_address (if specified)
	  instead of the "all" address.  This causes the packets to originate from
	  the specified address.

	* pbx: Deadlock between contexts container and context_merge locks

	  Recent changes (ASTERISK-25394 commit 2bd27d12223fe33b58c453965ed5c6ed3af7c4f5)
	  introduced the possibility of a deadlock. Due to the mentioned modifications
	  ast_change_hints now needs to keep both merge/delete and state callbacks from
	  occurring while it executes. Unfortunately, sometimes ast_change_hints can be
	  called with the contexts container locked. When this happens it's possible for
	  another thread to grab the context_merge_lock before the thread calling into
	  ast_change_hints does and then try to obtain the contexts container lock. This
	  of course causes a deadlock between the two threads. The thread calling into
	  ast_change_hints waits for the other thread to release context_merge_lock and
	  the other thread is waiting on that one to release the contexts container lock.

	  Unfortunately, there is not a great way to fix this problem. When hints change,
	  the subsequent state callbacks cannot run at the same time as a merge/delete,
	  nor when the usual state callbacks do. This patch alleviates the problem by
	  having those particular callbacks (the ones run after a hint change) occur in a
	  serialized task. By moving the context_merge_lock to a task it can now safely be
	  attempted or held without a deadlock occurring.

	  This reverts commit 0a9941de9d24093b5ff44096d1d7406f29d11e45.

	  Matt,

	  This patch causes another problem and should not have been needed.
	  Before this patch, persistent_endpoint_contact_deleted_observer WAS
	  deleting the contact_status when ast_sip_location_delete_contact was
	  called.  By deleting it yourself in ast_sip_location_delete_contact
	  it was gone before the observer could run and the observer therefore
	  was throwing an error and not sending stasis/AMI/statsd messages.

	  So, I don't think this was the cause of your original issue.  I also
	  had verified the contact AMI and statsd lifecycle and it was working.
	  I'll double check now though.

	* PJSIP: Prevent deadlock due to dialog/transaction lock inversion.

	  A deadlock was observed where the monitor thread was stuck, therefore
	  resulting in no incoming SIP traffic being processed.

	  The problem occurred when two 200 OK responses arrived in response to a
	  terminating NOTIFY request sent from Asterisk. The first 200 OK was
	  dispatched to a threadpool worker, who locked the corresponding
	  transaction. The second 200 OK arrived, resulting in the monitor thread
	  locking the dialog. At this point, the two threads are at odds, because
	  the monitor thread attempts to lock the transaction, and the threadpool
	  thread loops attempting to try to lock the dialog.

	  In this case, the fix is to not have the monitor thread attempt to hold
	  both the dialog and transaction locks at the same time. Instead, we
	  release the dialog lock before attempting to lock the transaction.

	  There have also been some debug messages added to the process in an
	  attempt to make it more clear what is going on in the process.

	  The 11/13 branches and master use 2 different file version macros. 11/13
	  uses ASTERISK_FILE_VERSION but master uses ASTERISK_REGISTER_FILE. This
	  means a new file added to 11/13 can't just be cherry-picked to master

	  To make cherry-picking possible, ASTERISK_REGISTER_FILE was added
	  to asterisk.h as a simple alias for ASTERISK_FILE_VERSION(__FILE__, NULL)
	  The "$Revision$" tag doesn't do anything since Asterisk moved to git so
	  just passing NULL as the verison works fine.  asterisk.h was also
	  annotated to deprecate ASTERISK_FILE_VERSION and suggest using
	  ASTERISK_REGISTER_FILE for all new files.

	  Finally, 2 recent file additions, pbx_builtins.c and pbx_functions.c,
	  were modified to use the new macro to make sure it actually worked.

	* voicemail: Move app_voicemail / res_mwi_external conflict to runtime

	  The menuselect conflict between app_voicemail and res_mwi_external
	  makes it hard to package 1 version of Asterisk.  There no actual
	  build dependencies between the 2 so moving this check to runtime
	  seems like a better solution.

	  The ast_vm_register and ast_vm_greeter_register functions in app.c
	  were modified to return AST_MODULE_LOAD_DECLINE instead of -1 if there
	  is already a voicemail module registered. The modules' load_module
	  functions were then modified to return DECLINE instead of -1 to the
	  loader.  Since -1 is interpreted by the loader as AST_MODULE_LOAD_FAILURE,
	  the modules were incorrectly causing Asterisk to stop so this needed
	  to be cleaned up anyway.

	  Now you can build both and use modules.conf to decide which voicemail
	  implementation to load.

	  The default menuselect options still build app_voicemail and not
	  res_mwi_external but if both ARE built, res_mwi_external will load
	  first and become the voicemail provider unless modules.conf rules
	  prevent it.  This is noted in CHANGES.

	* app_dial: Immediately exit dial if the caller is already hung up.

	  If a caller hangs up before dial is executed within an AGI then the AGI
	  has likely eaten all queued frames before executing the dial in DeadAGI
	  mode.  With the caller hung up and no pending frames from the caller's
	  read queue, dial would not know that the call has hung up until a called
	  channel answers.  It is rather annoying to whoever just answered the
	  non-existent call.

	  Dial should not continue execution in DeadAGI mode, hangup handlers, or
	  the h exten.

	  * Added a check early in dial to abort dialing if the caller has hungup.

	* main/cdr: Allow setting properties on a finalized CDR if it is the last one

	  Prior to this patch, we explicitly disallowed setting any properties on a
	  finalized CDR. This seemed like a good idea at the time; in practice, it was
	  more restrictive.

	  There are weird and strange scenarios where setting a property on a finalized
	  CDR is definitely wrong. For example, we may Fork a CDR, finalizing the
	  previous one, then change a property. In said case, the old CDR is supposed
	  to now be 'immutable' (so to speak), and should not be updated. From the
	  perspective of the code, a forked CDR that is finalized is just finalized.
	  Hence why we decided these should not be updated.

	  In practice, it is much more common to want to set a property on a CDR in
	  the h extension or in a hangup handler. Disallowing a common scenario to make
	  an esoteric behaviour work isn't good. This patch fixes this by allowing
	  callers to set a property IF we are the last CDR in the chain. This preserves
	  the finalized CDR if it was forked, while allowing the more common case to
	  function.

	* main/cdr: Set the end time on a CDR if endbeforehexten is Yes

	  Prior to this patch, the CDR engine attempted to set the end time on a CDR
	  that was executing hangup logic and with endbeforehexten set to Yes by
	  calling a function that inspects the properties on the Party A snapshot to
	  determine if we are ready to set the end time. That always failed. This is
	  because a Party A snapshot is not updated for CDRs that are executing hangup
	  logic with endbeforehexten=Yes.

	  Instead of calling a function that looks at the Party A snapshot, we just
	  simply set the end time on the CDR. This is safe to call multiple times, and is
	  safe to call at this point as we know that (a) we are executing hangup logic,
	  and (b) we are supposed to set the end time at this point.

	* test_time: Provide a timeout when waiting.

	  The test_timezone_watch unit test is written to expect a

	  There exists a small window where the test_timezone_watch
	  thread can signal the inotify daemon thread while it is not
	  reading on the underlying file descriptor. If this occurs
	  the test_timezone_watch thread will wait indefinitely for a

	* endpoint/stasis: Eliminate duplicate events on endpoint status change

	  When an endpoint is created, its messages are forwarded to both the tech
	  endpoint topic and the all endpoints topic. This is done so that various
	  parties interested in endpoint messages can subscribe to just the tech
	  endpoint and receive all messages associated with that particular technology,
	  as opposed to subscribing to the all endpoints topic. Unfortunately, when the
	  tech endpoint is created, it also forwards all of its messages to the all
	  topic. This results in duplicate messages whenever an endpoint publishes its
	  messages.

	  This patch resolves the duplicate message issue by creating a new function
	  for Stasis caching topics, stasis_cp_sink_create. In most respects, this acts
	  as a normal caching topic, save that it no longer forwards messages it receives
	  to the all endpoints topic. This allows it to act as an aggregation "sink",
	  while preserving the necessary caching behaviour.

	* res_http_websocket.c: prevent avoidable disconnections caused by write errors

	  Updated ast_websocket_write to encode the entire frame in to one
	  write operation, to ensure that we don't end up with a situation
	  where the websocket header has been sent, while the body can not
	  be written.

	  Previous to August's patch in commit b9bd3c14, certain network
	  conditions could cause the header to be written, and then the
	  sub-sequent body to fail - which would cause the next successful
	  write to contain a new header, and a new body (resulting in
	  the peer receiving two headers - the second of which would be
	  read as part of the body for the first header).

	  This was patched to have both write operations individually fail
	  by closing the websocket.

	  In a case available to the submitter of this patch, the same
	  body which would consistently fail to write, would succeed
	  if written at the same time as the header.

	  This update merges the two operations in to one, adds debug messages
	  indicating the reason for a websocket connection being closed during
	  a write operation, and clarifies some variable names for code legibility.

	* res_pjsip_history: Add a module that provides PJSIP history for debugging

	  This patch adds a new module, res_pjsip_history, that provides a slightly
	  better way of debugging SIP message traffic on a busy Asterisk system. The
	  existing mechanisms all rely on passively dumping a SIP message to the CLI.
	  While this is perfectly fine for logging purposes and well controlled
	  environments, on many installations, the amount of SIP messages Asterisk
	  receives will quickly swamp the CLI. This makes it difficult to view/capture
	  those messages that you want to diagnose in real time.

	  This patch provides another way of handling this. When enabled, the module
	  will store SIP message traffic in memory. This traffic can then be queried
	  at leisure.

	  In order to make the querying useful, a CLI command has been implemented,
	  'pjsip show history', that supports a basic expression syntax similar to
	  SQL or other query languages. A small number of useful fields have been
	  added in this initial patch; additional fields can easily be added in
	  later improvements. Those fields are:
	   - number: The entry index in the history
	   - timestamp: The time the message was recieved
	   - addr: The source/destination address of the message
	   - sip.msg.request.method: The request method
	   - sip.msg.call-id: The Call-ID header

	  Note - this is a resurrection of the module initially proposed on Review Board
	  here: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4053/

	* chan_sip.c: fix websocket_write_timeout default value

	  websocket_write_timeout was not being set to its default value
	  during sip config reload, which meant that prior to this commit,
	  1) the default value of 100 was not used, unless an invalid value
	  (or 1) was specified in sip.conf for websocket_write_timeout, and
	  2) if the websocket_write_timeout directive was removed from sip.conf
	  without a full restart of asterisk, then the previous value would
	  continue to be used indefinitely.

	  This essentially lead to a 0ms write timeout (the first write attempt
	  in ast_careful_fwrite must have succeeded) in websocket write requests
	  from chan_sip, unless websocket_write_timeout was explicitely set in sip.conf.

	  Changes to websocket_write_timeout still only apply to new websocket
	  sessions, after the sip reload -- timeouts on existing sessions are
	  not adjusted during sip reload.

	* res/res_pjsip_location: Delete contact_status object when contact is deleted

	  In 450579e908, a change was made that removed the deletion of the
	  'contact_status' object when a 'contact' object is deleted in sorcery.
	  This unfortunately means that the 'contact_status' object persists, even when
	  something has explicitly removed a contact. The result is that the state of
	  the contact will not be regenerated if that contact is re-created, and the
	  stale state will be reported/used for that contact. It also results in
	  no ContactStatusChanged events being generated for either ARI or AMI.

	  This patch restores the deletion logic that was removed. Doing so now
	  results in the expected events being generated again.

	  - Trigger pending DTLS packets to send out, once the RTP instance's remote

	  - Avoids locking the DTLS structure unnecessarily by only doing this if
	    DTLS is passive.
	  - Add DTLS locks around the structurally sensitive calls in the SSL

	    inside of itself, and we're dealing with the SSL BIO in at least two

	  ast_rtp_remote_address_set is called, which causes there to be a pending
	  response to send out.   Previous to 1ad827, this was handled by calling
	  dtls_srtp_check_pending on receipt of any RTP packet - a STUN or RTP
	  packet could trigger the pending handshake response.  Since that was
	  rightfully removed, whenever the DTLS handshake is received before the
	  remote address is set, we would have to wait until another SSL packet
	  arrives.

	  As of Chrome M47's optimizations to their handshake process, WebRTC
	  conversations between Chrome M47+ and Asterisk, where Asterisk is passive,
	  experience a 1 second delay without this patch, because the SSL handshake
	  is received before ICE negotation stores the remote_address, and the next
	  SSL packet isn't received until after a 1 second timeout in Chrome, which
	  causes a new handshake request.

	* main/utils: Don't emit an ERROR message if the read end of a pipe closes

	  An ERROR or WARNING message should generally indicate that something has gone
	  wrong in Asterisk. In the case of writing to a file descriptor, Asterisk is not
	  in control of when the far end closes its reading on a file descriptor. If the
	  far end does close the file descriptor in an unclean fashion, this isn't a bug
	  or error in Asterisk, particularly when the situation can be gracefully
	  handled in Asterisk.

	  Currently, when this happens, a user would see the following somewhat cryptic
	  ERROR message:

	    "utils.c: write() returned error: Broken pipe"

	  There's a few problems with this:
	  (1) It doesn't provide any context, other than 'something broke a pipe'
	  (2) As noted, it isn't actually an error in Asterisk
	  (3) It can get rather spammy if the thing breaking the pipe occurs often, such
	      as a FastAGI server
	  (4) Spammy ERROR messages make Asterisk appear to be having issues, or can even
	      mask legitimate issues

	  This patch changes ast_carefulwrite to only log an ERROR if we actually had one
	  that was reasonably under our control. For debugging purposes, we still emit
	  a debug message if we detect that the far side has stopped reading.

	* res_pjsip/contacts/statsd:  Make contact lifecycle events more consistent

	  It will never be perfect or even pretty, mostly because of the differences
	  between static and dynamic contacts.

	  Created:

	  Can't use the contact or contact_status alloc functions
	  because the objects come and go regardless of the actual state.

	  Can't use the contact_apply_handler, ast_sip_location_add_contact or
	  a sorcery created handler because they only get called for dynamic
	  contacts.  Similarly, permanent_uri_handler only gets called for
	  static contacts.

	  So, Matt had it right. :)  ast_res_pjsip_find_or_create_contact_status is
	  the only place it can go and not have duplicated code.  Both
	  permanent_uri_handler and contact_apply_handler call find_or_create.

	  Removed:

	  Can't use the destructors for the same reason as above.  The only
	  place to put this is in persistent_endpoint_contact_deleted_observer
	  which I believe is the "correct" place but even that will handle only
	  dynamic contacts.  This doesn't called on shutdown however.  There is
	  no hook to use for static contacts that may be removed because of a
	  config change while asterisk is in operation.

	  I moved the cleanup of contact_status from ast_sip_location_delete_contact
	  to the handler as well.

	  Status Change and RTT:

	  Although they worked fine where they were (in update_contact_status) I
	  moved them to persistent_endpoint_contact_status_observer to make it
	  more consistent with removed.  There was logic there already to detect
	  a state change.

	  Finally, fixed a nit in permanent_uri_handler rmudgett reported
	  eralier.

	* res_pjsip: Use a MD5 hash for static Contact IDs

	  When 90d9a70789 was merged, it mostly tested dynamic contacts created as
	  a result of registering a PJSIP endpoint. Contacts generated in this
	  fashion typically have a long alphanumeric string as their object identifier,
	  which maps reasonably well for StatsD. Unfortunately, this doesn't work in the
	  general case. StatsD treats both '.' and ':' characters as special characters.
	  In particular, having a ':' appear in the middle of a StatsD metric will
	  result in the metric being rejected.

	  This causes some obvious issues with SIP URIs.

	  The StatsD API should not be responsible for escaping the metric name passed
	  to it. The metric is treated as a single long string, and it would be
	  challenging to know what to escape in the string passed to the function.
	  Likewise, we don't want to escape the metric in PJSIP, as that involves
	  overhead that is wasted when either res_statsd isn't loaded or enabled.

	  This patch takes an alternative approach. The Contact ID has been changed
	  to be "aor@@uri_hash" instead of "aor@@uri". This (a) won't contain any of the
	  aforementioned special characters, (b) can be done on Contact creation,
	  which has minimal impact on run-time performance, and (c) also conforms to an
	  earlier commit that changed the ID for dynamic contacts.

	  The downside of this is that StatsD users will have to map SHA1 hashes back to
	  the Contacts that are emitting the statistics. To that end, the CLI commands
	  have been updated to include the first 10 characters of the MD5 hash, which
	  should be enough to match what is shown in Graphite (or some other StatsD
	  backend).

	* bridges/bridge_t38: Add a bridging module for managing T.38 state

	  When 4875e5ac32 was merged, it fixed several issues with a direct media bridge
	  transitioning to handling a T.38 fax. However, it uncovered a race condition
	  caused by the bridging core. When a channel involved in a T.38 fax leaves a
	  bridge, the frame queued by the channel driver that should inform the far side
	  that it is no longer in a T.38 fax may not make it across the bridge. The
	  bridging framework is *extremely* aggressive in tearing down the bridge, and
	  control frames that are currently in flight *may* get dropped.

	  This patch adds a new module to the bridging framework, bridge_t38. This module
	  maintains some notion of the T.38 state for the two channels in a bridge. When
	  the bridge detects that it is being torn down or when one of the two channels
	  leaves, it informs the respective channel(s) that they should stop faxing. This
	  ensures that channels switch back to audio if they survive and are ejected out
	  of a bridge while faxing.

	* chan_pjsip: Handle T.38 faxes with direct media bridges

	  When a channel is in a direct media bridge, a re-INVITE may arrive that forces
	  Asterisk to re-negotiate the media to a T.38 fax. When this occurs, the bridge
	  must change its technology to a simple bridge, and re-INVITE the media back
	  to Asterisk.

	  Generally, this logic mostly already exists in Asterisk. However, prior to this
	  patch, there were a few bugs:
	  (1) The T.38 framehook currently prevents a channel capable of T.38 faxes from
	      ever entering into a direct media bridge. This applies even when the only
	      media being passed over the channel is audio. This patch fixes this bug
	      by having the framehook specify that it defers caring about any frame type.
	      This allows the channels to enter into a direct media bridge, which will
	      be broken when a re-INVITE is received.
	  (2) When a re-INVITE is received, nothing instructed the bridging layer to
	      re-inspect the allowed bridging technology. This now occurs when either
	      a re-INVITE is received from a peer, or when a response is received from
	      the far end (that is, when the T.38 state changes to either
	      T38_PEER_REINVITE or T38_LOCAL_REINVITE).
	  (3) chan_pjsip needs to do a small amount of work to prevent a direct media
	      bridge from being chosen when a T.38 session is in progress. When a T.38
	      session supplement has a t38 datastore - which is added when we detect
	      we should start thinking about T.38 on a channel - we now refuse a native
	      RTP bridge.
	  (4) When a BYE request is received, we don't terminate the T.38 session. If
	      the other side of a T.38 fax survives the hangup (due to the 'g' flag
	      in Dial, for example), we don't currently re-INVITE the media on the
	      other channel back to audio. This patch now has res_pjsip_t38 intercept
	      BYE requests and inform the far side that the T.38 session is terminated.
	      This naturally causes the correct re-INVITEs to be sent.

	* res/res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Apply configuration on object type load

	  When Asterisk is configured to use a dynamic sorcery backend (such as
	  res_sorcery_astdb) with 'registration' objects, it will fail to create the
	  internal state objects associated with the registration objects on module
	  load. This is due to nothing actually querying for the specific objects
	  and calling their sorcery apply handler during module load.

	  This patch fixes that by calling get_registrations in the sorcery observer's
	  object_type_loaded handler. Doing this causes the sorcery backends to be
	  asked for the current state of all registration objects, which causes the
	  apply handler to be called and the internal run-time state to be created.

	* res_statsd: Add functions that support variable arguments

	  Often, the metric names of statistics we are generating for StatsD have some
	  dynamic component to them. This can be the name of a particular resource, or
	  some internal status label in Asterisk. With the current set of functions,
	  callers of the statsd API must first build the metric name themselves, then
	  pass this to the API functions. This results in a large amount of boilerplate
	  code and usage of either fixed length static buffers or dynamic memory
	  allocation, neither of which is desireable.

	  This patch adds two new functions to the StatsD API that support a printf
	  style format specifier for constructing the metric name. A dynamic string,
	  allocated in threadstorage, is used to build the metric name. This eases
	  the burden on users of the StatsD API.

	  Receiving a 423 Interval Too Brief response after authentication for an

	  For registrations, PJSIP/PJPROJECT intercepts the handling of 423

	  rejected the authentication we sent earlier.

	  * Made registration challenges keep track of the CSeq number to determine
	  if the received challenge response was for the request we thought we sent.
	  If the response's CSeq number differs from the CSeq number we last sent
	  with authentication then authenticate again because it is a challenge to a
	  different request.

	* res/res_pjsip: Fix off nominal crash with requests that fail and have a timer

	  When a request is sent using pjsip_endpt_send_request and fails, a condition
	  exists where the request wrapper, which is an AO2 object, may be de-ref'd
	  more times than it should. This occurs when the request's callback is called,
	  and, in the callback, the timer on the PJSIP heap is cancelled. When that
	  occurs, the request wrapper's lifetime is decremented. When
	  pjsip_endpt_send_request fails, we unilaterally decrement the lifetime of
	  the request wrapper again, even though we've already cancelled the reference
	  associated with the timer.

	  This patch checks the return result of pj_timer_heap_cancel_if_active before
	  removing the reference associated with the timer. We now only decrement it
	  in this case if a timer is cancelled as a result of the function call.

	* main/dial: Protect access to the format_cap structure of the requesting channel

	  When a dial attempt is made that involves a requesting channel, we previously
	  were not:
	  a) Protecting access to the native format capabilities structure on the
	     requesting channel. That is inherently unsafe.
	  b) Reference bumping the lifetime of the format capabilities structure.

	  In both cases, something else could sneak in, blow away the format
	  capabilities, and we'd be holding onto an invalid format_cap structure. When
	  the newly created channel attempts to construct its format capabilities, things
	  go poorly.

	  This patch:
	  a) Ensures that we get a reference to the native format capabilities while
	     the requesting channel is locked
	  b) Holds a reference to the native format capabilities during the creation
	     of the new channel.

	* res_pjsip: Set threadpool max size default to 50.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Prevent sending NOTIFY on destroyed dialog.

	  A certain situation can result in our attempting to send a NOTIFY on a
	  destroyed dialog. Say we attempt to send a NOTIFY to a subscriber, but
	  that subscriber has dropped off the network. We end up retransmitting
	  that NOTIFY until the appropriate SIP timer says to destroy the NOTIFY
	  transaction. When the pjsip evsub code is told that the transaction has
	  been terminated, it responds in kind by alerting us that the
	  subscription has been terminated, destroying the subscription, and then
	  removing its reference to the dialog, thus destroying the dialog.

	  The problem is that when we get told that the subscription is being
	  terminated, we detect that we have not sent a terminating NOTIFY
	  request, so we queue up such a NOTIFY to be sent out. By the time that
	  queued NOTIFY gets sent, the dialog has been destroyed, so attempting to
	  send that NOTIFY can result in a crash.

	  The fix being introduced here is actually a reintroduction of something
	  the pubsub code used to employ. We hold a reference to the dialog and
	  wait to decrement our reference to the dialog until our subscription
	  tree object is destroyed. This way, we can send messages on the dialog
	  even if the PJSIP evsub code wants to terminate earlier than we would
	  like.

	  In doing this, some NULL checks for subscription tree dialogs have been
	  removed since NULL dialogs are no longer actually possible.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Ensure dialog lock balance.

	  When sending a NOTIFY, we lock the dialog and then unlock the dialog
	  when finished. A recent change made it so that the subscription tree's
	  dialog pointer will be set NULL when sending the final NOTIFY request
	  out. This means that when we attempt to unlock the dialog, we pass a
	  NULL pointer to pjsip_dlg_dec_lock(). The result is that the dialog
	  remains locked after we think we have unlocked it. When a response to
	  the NOTIFY arrives, the monitor thread attempts to lock the dialog, but
	  it cannot because we never released the dialog lock. This results in
	  Asterisk being unable to process incoming SIP traffic any longer.

	  The fix in this patch is to use a local pointer to save off the pointer
	  value of the subscription tree's dialog when locking and unlocking the
	  dialog. This way, if the subscription tree's dialog pointer is NULLed
	  out, the local pointer will still have point to the proper place and the
	  dialog lock will be unlocked as we expect.

	  NOTIFY is sent. However, after the final NOTIFY is sent, the persistence
	  update function still attempts to access the cseq from the dialog,
	  resulting in a crash.

	  This fix removes the subscription persistence at the same time that the
	  dialog is removed from the subscription tree. This way, there is no
	  attempt to update persistence when the subscription is being destroyed.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Remove serializer when sending final NOTIFY.

	  There have been crashes seen where a taskprocessor's listener is NULL
	  unexpectedly.

	  Looking at backtraces, the problem was specifically seen in PJSIP
	  serializers.

	  Subscriptions make the mistake of removing a serializer from a dialog
	  during subscription tree destruction. Since subscription trees are
	  reference-counted, guaranteeing the circumstances behind the destruction
	  are not possible. This makes it so that the dialog serializer can be
	  removed while not holding the dialog lock. This makes it possible for
	  the distributor to get a pointer to the dialog serializer and have that
	  serializer get freed out from under it.

	  The fix for this is to remove the serializer from a subscription dialog
	  when sending the final NOTIFY. This guarantees that the serializer is
	  removed with the dialog lock held. By doing this, we guarantee that if
	  the distributor gains access to the dialog's serializer, it will not be
	  possible for the serializer to get freed by another thread.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Solidify lifetime and ownership of objects.

	  There have been crashes and general instability seen in the pubsub code,
	  so this patch introduces three changes to increase the stability.

	  First, the ownership model for subscriptions has been modified. Due to
	  RLS, subscriptions are stored in memory as a tree structure. Prior to my
	  patch, the PJSIP subscription was the owner of the subscription tree.
	  When the PJSIP subscription told us that it was terminating, we started
	  destroying the subscription tree along with all of the individual leaf
	  subscriptions that belong to the tree. The problem with this model is
	  that the two actors in play here, the PJSIP subscription and the
	  individual leaf subscriptions, need to have joint ownership of the
	  subscription tree. So now, the PJSIP subscription and the individual
	  leaf subscriptions each have a reference to the subscription tree. This
	  way, we will not actually free memory until no players are left that
	  care. The PJSIP subscription is a bigger stakeholder, in that if the
	  PJSIP subscription's reference to the subscription tree is removed, the
	  subscription tree instructs the leaf subscriptions to shut down and drop
	  their references to the subscription tree when possible. The individual
	  leaf subscriptions, upon being told to shut down, can drop their stasis
	  subscriptions or whatever they use to learn of new state, and then drop
	  their reference to the subscription tree once they are ready to die.

	  Second, the lifetime of a PJSIP subscription's reference to our
	  subscription tree has been altered. As I learned from doing a deep dive,
	  the PJSIP evsub code can tell Asterisk multiple times that the
	  subscription has been terminated, and not all of these times
	  are especially helpful. I have altered the message flow that we use for
	  SIP subscriptions such that we will always drop the PJSIP subscription's
	  reference to the subscription tree when we send the NOTIFY that
	  terminates a SIP subscription. This also means that we will now queue
	  NOTIFY requests to be sent after responding to incoming SUBSCRIBEs so
	  that we can have predictable state changes from the PJSIP evsub code.

	  Third, the synchronization of operations has been improved. PJSIP can
	  call into our code from a serializer thread (e.g. upon receiving an
	  incoming request) or from the monitor thread (e.g. when a subscription
	  times out). Because of this, there is the possibility of competing
	  threads stepping on each other. PJSIP attempts to do some
	  synchronization on its own by always keeping the dialog lock held when
	  it calls into us. However, since we end up pushing tasks into the
	  serializer, the result was that serialized operations were not grabbing
	  the dialog lock and could, as a result, step on something that was being
	  attempted by a different thread. Now we ensure that serialized
	  operations grab the dialog lock, then check for extenuating
	  circumstances, then proceed with their operation if they can.

	* res_pjsip: Move URI validation to use time.

	  In a realtime based system with a limited number of threadpool threads
	  it is possible for a deadlock to occur. This happens when permanent
	  endpoint state is updated, which will cause database queries to be done.
	  These queries may result in URI validation being done which is done
	  synchronously using a PJSIP thread. If all PJSIP threads are in use
	  processing traffic they themselves may be blocked waiting to get the
	  permanent endpoint container lock when identifying an endpoint.

	  This change moves URI validation to occur at use time instead of
	  configuration time. While this comes at a cost of not seeing a problem
	  until you use it it does solve the underlying deadlock problem.

	* res_config_pgsql.c: Fix deadlock loading realtime configuration.

	  On v13, loading several thousand PJSIP endpoints on Asterisk start causes
	  a deadlock most of the time.

	  Thanks to mdu113 for discovering that there was a call to pgsql_exec() not
	  protected by the pgsql_lock reentrancy lock.

	  {quote}
	  I believe a code path exists that attempts to use pgsql connection without
	  locking pgsql_lock.  I believe what happens during that deadlock that I
	  see is two concurrent threads are both attempting to send query to pgsql,
	  one of the thread is using a code path without locking pgsql_lock.  If
	  they managed to send queries at the same time, it seems postgres ignores
	  one of the queries and replies only to the one of them.  If it happens so
	  that the thread holding the lock didn't receive the reply it will wait for
	  it (and hold the lock) forever (or at least for very long time), thus
	  completely blocking all access to db.
	  {quote}

	  * Added missing reentrancy locking around pgsql_exec() in find_table().

	  * Moved unlock of pgsql_lock in unload_module() to avoid locking inversion
	  between the psql_tables list lock and the pgsql_lock.

	* res_pjsip: Fix deadlock when sending out-of-dialog requests.

	  The struct send_request_wrapper has a pjsip lock associated with it that
	  is created non-recursive.  There is a code path for the struct
	  send_request_wrapper lock that will attempt to lock it recursively.  The
	  reporter's deadlock showed that the thread calling endpt_send_request()
	  deadlocked itself right after the wrapper object got created.

	  Out-of-dialog requests such as MESSAGE, qualify OPTIONS, and unsolicited
	  MWI NOTIFY messages can hit this deadlock.

	  * Replaced the struct send_request_wrapper pjsip lock with the mutex lock
	  that can come with an ao2 object since all of Asterisk's mutexes are
	  recursive.  Benefits include removal of code maintaining the pjsip
	  non-recursive lock since ao2 objects already know how to maintain their
	  own lock and the lock will show up in the CLI "core show locks" output.

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk: Fix assignment after ao2 decrement

	  When we decide we will no longer schedule an RTCP write, we remove the
	  reference to the RTP instance, then assign -1 to the stored scheduler ID
	  in case something else comes along and wants to see if anything is scheduled.

	  That scheduler ID is on the RTP instance. After 60a9172d7ef2 was merged to
	  fix the regression introduced by 3cf0f29310, this improper assignment on a
	  potentially destroyed object started getting tripped on the build agents.

	  Frankly, this should have been crashing a lot more often earlier. I can only
	  assume that the timing was changed just enough by both changes to start
	  actually hitting this problem.

	  As it is, simply moving the assignment prior to the ao2 deference is sufficient
	  to keep the RTP instance from being referenced when it is very, truly,
	  aboslutely dead.

	  (Note that it is still good practice to assign -1 to the scheduler ID when we
	  know we won't be scheduling it again, as the ao2 deref *may* not always destroy
	  the ao2 object.)

	* chan_pjsip: Fix crash on reINVITE before initial INVITE completes.

	  Apparently some endpoints attempt to send a reINVITE before completing the
	  initial INVITE transaction.  In this case PJSIP responds appropriately to
	  the reINVITE with a 491 INVITE request pending.  Unfortunately chan_pjsip
	  is using the initial INVITE transaction state to determine if an INVITE is
	  the initial INVITE or a reINVITE.  Since the initial INVITE transaction
	  has not been confirmed yet chan_pjsip thinks the reINVITE is an initial
	  INVITE and starts another PBX thread on the channel.  The extra PBX thread
	  ensures that hilarity ensues.

	  * Fix checks for a reINVITE on incoming requests to look for the presence
	  of a to-tag instead of the initial INVITE transaction state.

	  * Made caller_id_incoming_request() determine what to do if there is a
	  channel on the session or not.  After a channel is created it is too late
	  to just store the new party id on the session because the session's party
	  id has already been copied to the channel's caller id.

	* Fix improper usage of scheduler exposed by 5c713fdf18f

	  When 5c713fdf18f was merged, it allowed for scheduled items to have an ID of
	  '0' returned. While this was valid per the documentation for the API, it was
	  apparently never returned previously. As a result, several users of the
	  scheduler API viewed the result as being invalid, causing them to reschedule
	  already scheduled items or otherwise fail in interesting ways.

	  This patch corrects the users such that they view '0' as valid, and a returned
	  ID of -1 as being invalid.

	  Note that the failing HEP RTCP tests now pass with this patch. These tests
	  failed due to a duplicate scheduling of the RTCP transmissions.

	  When b99a7052621700a1aa641a1c24308f5873275fc8 was merged, subscribing to a
	  NULL bridge will now cause app_subscribe_bridge to implicitly subscribe to
	  all bridges. Unfortunately, the res_stasis control loop did not check that
	  a bridge changing on a channel's control object was actually also non-NULL.
	  As a result, app_subscribe_bridge will be called with a NULL bridge when a
	  channel leaves a bridge. This causes a new subscription to be made to the
	  bridge. If an application has also subscribed to the bridge, the application
	  will now have two subscriptions:
	  (1) The explicit one created by the app
	  (2) The implicit one accidentally created by the control structure

	  As a result, the 'BridgeDestroyed' event can be sent multiple times. This
	  patch corrects the control loop such that it only subscribes an application
	  to a new bridge if the bridge pointer is non-NULL.

	* logger: Prevent duplicate dynamic channels from being added.

	  There was a problem observed where the "logger add channel" CLI command
	  would allow for a channel with the same name to be added multiple times.
	  This would result in each message being written out to the same file
	  multiple times.

	  The problem was due to the difference in how logger channel filenames
	  are stored versus the format they are allowed to be presented when they
	  are added. For instance, if adding the logger channel "foo" through the
	  CLI, the result would be a logger channel with the file name
	  /var/log/asterisk/foo being stored. So when trying to add another "foo"
	  channel, "foo" would not match "/var/log/asterisk/foo" so we'd happily
	  add the duplicate channel.

	  The fix presented here is to introduce two new methods in the logger
	  code:
	   * make_filename(): given a logger channel name, this creates the
	     filename for that logger channel.
	   * find_logchannel(): given a logger channel name, this calls
	     make_filename() and then traverses the list of logchannels in order
	     to find a match.

	  This change has made use of make_filename() and find_logchannel()
	  throughout to more consistently behave.

	* Do not swallow frames on channels leaving bridges.

	  When leaving a bridge, indications on a channel could be swallowed by
	  the internal indication logic because it appears that the channel is on
	  its way to be hung up anyway. One such situation where this is
	  detrimental is when channels on hold are redirected out of a bridge. The
	  AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD indication from the bridging code is swallowed,
	  leaving the channel in question to still appear to be on hold.

	  The fix here is to modify the logic inside ast_indicate_data() to not
	  drop the indication if the channel is simply leaving a bridge. This way,
	  channels on hold redirected out of a bridge revert to their expected "in
	  use" state after the redirection.

	* app_page.c: Fix crash when forwarding with a predial handler.

	  Page uses the async method of dialing with the dial API.  When a call gets
	  forwarded there is no calling channel available.  If the predial handler
	  was set then the calling channel could not be put into auto-service
	  for the forwarded call because it doesn't exist.  A crash is the result.

	  * Moved the callee predial parameter string processing to before the
	  string is passed to the dial API rather than having the dial API do it.
	  There are a few benefits do doing this.  The first is the predial
	  parameter string processing doesn't need to be done for each channel
	  called by the dial API.  The second is in async mode and the forwarded
	  channel is to have the predial handler executed on it then the
	  non-existent calling channel does not need to be present to process the
	  predial parameter string.

	  * Don't start auto-service on a non-existent calling channel to execute
	  the predial handler when the dial API is in async mode and forwarding a
	  call.

	      resources of the 'channels' type.

	* pbx: Update device and presence state when changing a hint extension.

	  When a queued caller transfers an agent to another extension sometimes the

	  Since a transfer has taken place this should always be transfer. This occurs
	  because sometimes the stasis hangup event arrives before the transfer event
	  thus writing a different reason out.

	  With this patch, when a hangup event is received during a transfer it will
	  check to see if the channel that is hanging up is part of a transfer. If so
	  it will return and let the subsequently received transfer event handler take
	  care of the cleanup.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Eliminate race during initial NOTIFY.

	  There is a slim chance of a race condition occurring where two threads
	  can both attempt to manipulate the same area.

	  Thread A can be handling an incoming initial SUBSCRIBE request. Thread A
	  lets the specific subscription handler know that the subscription has
	  been established.

	  At this point, Thread B may detect a state change on the subscribed
	  resource and queue up a notification task on Thread C, the subscription
	  serializer thread.

	  Now Thread A attempts to generate the initial NOTIFY request to send to
	  the subscriber at the same time that Thread C attempts to generate a
	  state change NOTIFY request to send to the subscriber.

	  The result is that Threads A and C can step on the same memory area,
	  resulting in a crash. The crash has been observed as happening when
	  attempting to allocate more space to hold the body for the NOTIFY.

	  The solution presented here is to queue the subscription establishment
	  and initial NOTIFY generation onto the subscription serializer thread
	  (Thread C in the above scenario). This way, there is no way that a state
	  change notification can occur before the initial NOTIFY is sent, and if
	  there is a quick succession of NOTIFYs, we can guarantee that the two
	  NOTIFY requests will be sent in succession.

	* scheduler: Use queue for allocating sched IDs.

	  It has been observed that on long-running busy systems, a scheduler
	  context can eventually hit INT_MAX for its assigned IDs and end up
	  overflowing into a very low negative number. When this occurs, this can
	  result in odd behaviors, because a negative return is interpreted by
	  callers as being a failure. However, the item actually was successfully
	  scheduled. The result may be that a freed item remains in the scheduler,
	  resulting in a crash at some point in the future.

	  The scheduler can overflow because every time that an item is added to
	  the scheduler, a counter is bumped and that counter's current value is
	  assigned as the new item's ID.

	  This patch introduces a new method for assigning scheduler IDs. Instead
	  of assigning from a counter, a queue of available IDs is maintained.
	  When assigning a new ID, an ID is pulled from the queue. When a
	  scheduler item is released, its ID is pushed back onto the queue. This
	  way, IDs may be reused when they become available, and the growth of ID
	  numbers is directly related to concurrent activity within a scheduler
	  context rather than the uptime of the system.

	* res/res_pjsip: Purge contacts when an AoR is deleted

	  When an AoR is deleted by an external mechanism, such as through ARI, we
	  currently do not remove dynamic contacts that were created for that AoR as a
	  result of a received REGISTER request. As a result, re-creating the AoR will
	  cause the dynamic contact to be interpreted as a persistent contact, leading
	  to some rather strange state being created for the contacts/endpoints.

	  This patch adds a sorcery observer for the 'aor' object. When a delete is
	  issued on the underlying sorcery object, the observer is called, and all
	  contacts created and persisted in sorcery for that AoR are also removed. Note
	  that we don't want to perform this action when an AO2 object that is an AoR is
	  destroyed, as the AoR can still exist in the backing storage (and we would
	  thus be removing valid contacts from an AoR that still "exists".)

	* res_pjsip: Change default from user value.

	  When Asterisk sends an outbound SIP request, if there is no direct
	  reason to place a specific value for the username in the From header,
	  Asterisk would generate a UUID. For example, this would happen when
	  sending outbound OPTIONS requests when qualifying or when sending
	  outbound INVITE requests when originating (if no explicit caller ID were
	  provided). The issue is that some SIP providers reject these sorts of
	  requests with a "Name too long" error response.

	  This patch aims to fix this by changing the default outbound username in
	  From headers to "asterisk". This value can be overridden by changing the
	  default_from_user option in the global options if desired.

	* pbx: Fix crash when issuing "core show hints" with long pattern match.

	  When issuing the "core show hints" CLI command a combination of both
	  the hint extension and context is created. This uses a fixed size
	  buffer expecting that the extension will not exceed maximum extension
	  length. When the extension is actually a pattern match this constraint
	  does not hold true, and the extension may exceed the maximum extension
	  length. In this case extra characters are written past the end of the
	  fixed size buffer.

	  and context can not exceed the size of the buffer.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: re-re-fix persistent subscription storage.

	  A recent change to res_pjsip_pubsub switched to using pjsip_msg_print as
	  a means of writing an appropriate packet to persistent storage. While
	  this partially solved the issue, it had its own problems.
	  pjsip_msg_print will always add a Content-Length header to the message
	  it prints. Frequent restarts of Asterisk can result in persistent
	  subscriptions being written with five or more Content-Length headers. In
	  addition, sometimes some apparent corruption of individual headers could
	  be seen.

	  This aims to fix the problem by not running a parsed message through an
	  interpreter but rather by taking the raw message and saving it. The
	  logic for what to save is going to be different depending on whether a
	  SUBSCRIBE was received from the wire or if it was pulled from
	  persistence. When receiving a packet from the wire, when using a
	  streaming transport, the rdata->pkt_info.packet may contain multiple SIP
	  messages or fragments. However, the rdata->msg_info.msg_buf will always
	  contain the current SIP message to be processed. When pulling from
	  persistence, though, the rdata->msg_info.msg_buf will be NULL since no
	  transport actually handled the packet. However, since we know that we
	  will always ever pull one SIP message from persistence, we are free to
	  save directly from rdata->pkt_info.packet instead.

	  The res_pjsip_sdp_rtp module also does not stop RTP

	  replaced. This change adds a callback to the session media
	  interface to allow a media stream to be stopped without

	  When a BYE request is received the PJSIP invite session implementation

	  attempt to update the hangup cause code on the channel while it is
	  in the process of being hung up.

	* res_http_websocket: When shutting down a session don't close closed socket

	  Due to the use of ast_websocket_close in session termination it is
	  possible for the underlying socket to already be closed when the
	  session is terminated. This occurs when the close frame is attempted
	  to be written out but fails.

	* res_http_websocket: Forcefully terminate on write errors.

	  The res_http_websocket module will currently attempt to close
	  the WebSocket connection if fatal cases occur, such as when
	  attempting to write out data and being unable to. When the
	  fatal cases occur the code attempts to write a WebSocket close
	  frame out to have the remote side close the connection. If
	  writing this fails then the connection is not terminated.

	  This change forcefully terminates the connection if the
	  WebSocket is to be closed but is unable to send the close frame.

	* chan_dahdi.c: Flush the DAHDI write buffer after starting DTMF.

	  Pressing DTMF digits on a phone to go out on a DAHDI channel can result in
	  the digit not being recognized or even heard by the peer.

	  Phone -> Asterisk -> DAHDI/channel

	  Turns out the DAHDI behavior with DTMF generation (and any other generated
	  tones) is exposed by the "buffers=" setting in chan_dahdi.conf.  When
	  Asterisk requests to start sending DTMF then DAHDI waits until its write
	  buffer is empty before generating any samples for the DTMF tones.  When
	  Asterisk subsequently requests DAHDI to stop sending DTMF then DAHDI
	  immediately stops generating the DTMF samples.  As a result, the more
	  samples there are in the DAHDI write buffer the shorter the time DTMF
	  actually gets sent on the wire.  If there are more samples in the write
	  buffer than the time DTMF is supposed to be sent then no DTMF gets sent on
	  the wire.  With the "buffers=12,half" setting and each buffer representing
	  20 ms of samples then the DAHDI write buffer is going to contain around
	  120 ms of samples.  For DTMF to be recognized by the peer the actual sent
	  DTMF duration needs to be a minimum of 40 ms.  Therefore, the intended
	  duration needs to be a minimum of 160 ms for the peer to receive the
	  minimum DTMF digit duration to recognize it.

	  A simple and effective solution to work around the DAHDI behavior is for
	  Asterisk to flush the DAHDI write buffer when sending DTMF so the full
	  duration of DTMF is actually sent on the wire.  When someone is going to
	  send DTMF they are not likely to be talking before sending the tones so
	  the flushed write samples are expected to just contain silence.

	  * Made dahdi_digit_begin() flush the DAHDI write buffer after requesting
	  to send a DTMF digit.

	* chan_dahdi.c: Lock private struct for ast_write().

	  There is a window of opportunity for DTMF to not go out if an audio frame
	  is in the process of being written to DAHDI while another thread starts
	  sending DTMF.  The thread sending the audio frame could be past the
	  currently dialing check before being preempted by another thread starting
	  a DTMF generation request.  When the thread sending the audio frame
	  resumes it will then cause DAHDI to stop the DTMF tone generation.  The
	  result is no DTMF goes out.

	  * Made dahdi_write() lock the private struct before writing to the DAHDI

	  Some codecs that may be a third party library to Asterisk need to have

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: More accurately persist packet.

	  The pjsip_rx_data structure has a pkt_info.packet field on it that is
	  the packet that was read from the transport. For datagram transports,
	  the packet read from the transport will correspond to the SIP message
	  that arrived. For streamed transports, however, it is possible to read
	  multiple SIP messages in one packet.

	  In a recent case, Asterisk crashed on a system where TCP was being used.
	  This is because at some point, a read from the TCP socket resulted in a
	  200 OK response as well as an incoming SUBSCRIBE request being stored in
	  rdata->pkt_info.packet. When the SUBSCRIBE was processed, the
	  combination 200 OK and SUBSCRIBE was saved in persistent storage. Later,
	  a restart of Asterisk resulted in the crash because the persistent
	  subscription recreation code ended up building the 200 OK response
	  instead of a SUBSCRIBE request, and we attempted to access
	  request-specific data.

	  The fix here is to use the pjsip_msg_print() function in order to
	  persist SUBSCRIBE requests. This way, rather than using the raw socket
	  data, we use the parsed SIP message that PJSIP has given us. If we
	  receive multiple SIP messages from a single read, we will be sure only
	  to save off the relevant SIP message. There also is a safeguard put in
	  place to make sure that if we do end up reconstructing a SIP response,
	  it will not cause a crash.

	* res_pjsip: Ensure sanitized XML is NULL terminated.

	  The ast_sip_sanitize_xml function is used to sanitize
	  a string for placement into XML. This is done by examining
	  an input string and then appending values to an output
	  buffer. The function used by its implementation, strncat,
	  has specific behavior that was not taken into account.
	  If the size of the input string exceeded the available
	  output buffer size it was possible for the sanitization
	  function to write past the output buffer itself causing
	  a crash. The crash would either occur because it was
	  writing into memory it shouldn't be or because the resulting
	  string was not NULL terminated.

	  This change keeps count of how much remaining space is
	  available in the output buffer for text and only allows
	  strncat to use that amount.

	  Since this was exposed by the res_pjsip_pidf_digium_body_supplement
	  module attempting to send a large message the maximum allowed
	  message size has also been increased in it.

	  A unit test has also been added which confirms that the
	  ast_sip_sanitize_xml function is providing NULL terminated
	  output even when the input length exceeds the output
	  buffer size.

	* res_http_websocket: Debug write lengths.

	  Commit 39cc28f6ea2140ad6d561fd4c9e9a66f065cecee attempted to fix a
	  test failure observed on 32 bit test agents by ensuring that a cast from
	  a 32 bit unsigned integer to a 64 bit unsigned integer was happening in
	  a predictable place. As it turns out, this did not cause test runs to
	  succeed.

	  This commit adds several redundant debug messages that print the payload
	  lengths of websocket frames. The idea here is that this commit will not
	  cause tests to succeed for the faulty test agent, but we might deduce
	  where the fault lies more easily this way by observing at what point the
	  expected value (537) changes to some ungangly huge number.

	  If you are wondering why something like this is being committed to the
	  branch, keep in mind that in commit
	  39cc28f6ea2140ad6d561fd4c9e9a66f065cecee I noted that the observed test
	  failures only happen when automated tests are run. Attempts to run the
	  tests by hand manually on the test agent result in the tests passing.

	* res_http_websocket: Avoid passing strlen() to ast_websocket_write().

	  We have seen a rash of test failures on a 32-bit build agent. Commit
	  48698a5e21d7307f61b5fb2bd39fd593bc1423ca solved an obvious problem where
	  we were not encoding a 64-bit value correctly over the wire. This
	  commit, however, did not solve the test failures.

	  In the failing tests, ARI is attempting to send a 537 byte text frame
	  over a websocket. When sending a frame this small, 16 bits are all that
	  is required in order to encode the payload length on the websocket
	  frame. However, ast_websocket_write() thinks that the payload length is
	  greater than 65535 and therefore writes out a 64 bit payload length.
	  Inspecting this payload length, the lower 32 bits are exactly what we
	  would expect it to be, 537 in hex. The upper 32 bits, are junk values
	  that are not expected to be there.

	  In the failure, we are passing the result of strlen() to a function that
	  expects a uint64_t parameter to be passed in. strlen() returns a size_t,
	  which on this 32-bit machine is 32 bits wide. Normally, passing a 32-bit
	  unsigned value to somewhere where a 64-bit unsigned value is expected
	  would cause no problems. In fact, in manual runs of failing tests, this
	  works just fine. However, ast_websocket_write() uses the Asterisk
	  optional API, which means that rather than a simple function call, there
	  are a series of macros that are used for its declaration and
	  implementation. These macros may be causing some sort of error to occur
	  when converting from a 32 bit quantity to a 64 bit quantity.

	  This commit changes the logic by making existing ast_websocket_write()
	  calls use ast_websocket_write_string() instead. Within
	  ast_websocket_write_string(), the 64-bit converted strlen is saved in a
	  local variable, and that variable is passed to ast_websocket_write()
	  instead.

	  Note that this commit message is full of speculation rather than
	  certainty. This is because the observed test failures, while always
	  present in automated test runs, never occur when tests are manually
	  attempted on the same test agent. The idea behind this commit is to fix
	  a theoretical issue by performing changes that should, at the least,
	  cause no harm. If it turns out that this change does not fix the failing
	  tests, then this commit should be reverted.

	* res_http_websocket: Properly encode 64 bit payload

	  A test agent was continuously failing all ARI tests when run against

	  payload length. For 64-bit payloads, the expected byte order over the

	  7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

	  However, we were sending the payload as

	  3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5, 4

	  This meant that we were saying to expect an absolutely MASSIVE payload
	  to arrive. Since we did not follow through on this expected payload
	  size, the client would sit patiently waiting for the rest of the payload
	  to arrive until the test would time out.

	  With this change, we use the htobe64() function instead of htonl() so
	  that a 64-bit byte-swap is performed instead of a 32 bit byte-swap.

	* holding_bridge: ensure moh participants get frames

	  Currently, if a blank musiconhold.conf is used, musiconhold will fail
	  to start for a channel going into a holding bridge with an anticipation
	  of getting music on hold. That being the case, no frames will be written
	  to the channel and that can pose a problem for blind transfers in PJSIP
	  which may rely on frames being written to get past the REFER framehook.
	  This patch makes holding bridges start a silence generator if starting
	  music on hold fails and makes it so that if no music on hold functions
	  are installed that the ast_moh_start function will report a failure so
	  that consumers of that function will be able to respond appropriately.

	* Local channels: Alternate solution to ringback problem.

	  Commit 54b25c80c8387aea9eb20f9f4f077486cbdf3e5d solved an issue where a
	  specific scenario involving local channels and a native local RTP bridge
	  could result in ringback still being heard on a calling channel even
	  after the call is bridged.

	  That commit caused many tests in the testsuite to fail with alarming
	  consequences, such as not sending DialBegin and DialEnd events, and
	  giving incorrect hangup causes during calls.

	  This commit reverts the previous commit and implements and alternate
	  solution. This new solution involves only passing AST_CONTROL_RINGING
	  frames across local channels if the local channel is in AST_STATE_RING.
	  Otherwise, the frame does not traverse the local channels. By doing
	  this, we can ensure that a playtones generator does not get started on
	  the calling channel but rather is started on the local channel on which
	  the ringing frame was initially indicated.

	* audiohook: Use manipulated frame instead of dropping it.

	  Previous changes to sample rate support in audiohooks accidentally

	  and not used. This change restores it.

	* Local channels: Do not block control -1 payloads.

	  Control frames with a -1 payload are used as a special signal to stop
	  playtones generators on channels. This indication is sent both by
	  app_dial as well as by ast_answer() when a call is answered in case any
	  tones were being generated on a calling channel.

	  This control frame type was made to stop traversing local channel pairs
	  as an optimization, because it was thought that it was unnecessary to
	  send these indications, and allowing such unnecessary control frames to
	  traverse the local channels would cause the local channels to optimize
	  away less quickly.

	  As it turns out, through some special magic dialplan code, it is
	  possible to have a tones being played on a non-local channel, and it is
	  important for the local channel to convey that the tones should be
	  stopped. The result of having tones continue to be played on the
	  non-local channel is that the tones play even once the channel has been
	  bridged. By not blocking the -1 control frame type, we can ensure that
	  this situation does not happen.

	* audiohook: Read the correct number of samples based on audiohook format.

	  Due to changes in audiohooks to support different sample rates the
	  underlying storage of samples is in the format of the audiohook
	  itself and not of the format being requested. This means that if a
	  channel is using G722 the samples stored will be at 16kHz. If
	  something subsequently reads from the audiohook at a format which
	  is not the same sample rate as the audiohook the number of samples
	  needs to be adjusted.

	  Given the following example:
	  1. Channel writing into audiohook at 16kHz (as it is using G722).
	  2. Chanspy reading from audiohook at 8kHz.

	  The original code would read 160 samples from the audiohook for
	  each 20ms of audio. This is incorrect. Since the audio in the
	  audiohook is at 16kHz the actual number needing to be read is 320.
	  Failure to read this much would cause the audiohook to reset
	  itself constantly as the buffer became full.

	  This change adjusts the requested number of samples by determining
	  the duration of audio requested and then calculating how many
	  samples that would be in the audiohook format.

	* ARI: Add support for push configuration of dynamic object

	  This patch adds support for push configuration of dynamic, i.e.,
	  sorcery, objects in Asterisk. It adds three new REST API calls to the
	  'asterisk' resource:
	   * GET /asterisk/{configClass}/{objectType}/{id}: retrieve the current
	     object given its ID. This returns back a list of ConfigTuples, which
	     define the fields and their present values that make up the object.
	   * PUT /asterisk/{configClass}/{objectType}/{id}: create or update an
	     object. A body may be passed with the request that contains fields to
	     populate in the object. The same format as what is retrieved using
	     the GET operation is used for the body, save that we specify that the
	     list of fields to update are contained in the "fields" attribute.
	   * DELETE /asterisk/{configClass}/{objectType}/{id}: remove a dynamic
	     object from its backing storage.

	  Note that the success/failure of these operations is somewhat
	  configuration dependent, i.e., you must be using a sorcery wizard that
	  supports the operation in question. If a sorcery wizard does not support
	  the create or delete mechanisms, then the REST API call will fail with a
	  403 forbidden.

	* res_pjsip_session.c: Fix crash on call disconnect.

	  The crash fix for ASTERISK-25183 backported some code from master to try
	  to make sure that a BYE response is processed by the same serializer used
	  by the BYE request.  The identified race condition causing that backport
	  was the BYE request code had not finished processing after sending the BYE
	  before the BYE response came in for processing under a different thread.
	  Unfortunately, there is still a race condition.  Now the race condition is
	  between destroying the call session's serializer in
	  ast_taskprocessor_unreference() and using ast_taskprocessor_get() to get a
	  reference to the serializer for a BYE response.  Even worse, the new race
	  condition is a design limitation of the taskprocessor implementation that
	  didn't matter in versions before v12.  Back then, taskprocessors were only
	  destroyed when a module unloaded.  Now res_pjsip can destroy them when a
	  call ends.

	  However, as noted on the ASTERISK-25183 commit,
	  session_inv_on_state_changed() is disassociating the dialog from the
	  session when the invite dialog state becomes PJSIP_INV_STATE_DISCONNECTED.
	  This is a tad too soon because our BYE request transaction has not
	  completed yet.

	  * Split session_end() that is called by session_inv_on_state_changed() to
	  hold off session destruction until the BYE transaction timeout occurs or a
	  failed initial INVITE transaction timeout occurs in
	  session_inv_on_tsx_state_changed().

	* bridge.c: Fixed race condition during attended transfer

	  During an attended transfer a thread is started that handles imparting the
	  bridge channel. From the start of the thread to when the bridge channel is
	  ready exists a gap that can potentially cause problems (for instance, the
	  channel being swapped is hung up before the replacement channel enters the
	  bridge thus stopping the transfer). This patch adds a condition that waits
	  for the impart thread to get to a point of acceptable readiness before
	  allowing the initiating thread to continue.

	* main/sorcery: Don't fail object set creation from JSON if field fails

	  Some individual fields may fail their conversion due to their default
	  values being invalid for their custom handlers. In particular,
	  configuration values that depend on others being enabled (and thus have
	  an empty default value) are notorious for tripping this routine up. An
	  example of this are any of the DTLS options for endpoints. Any of the
	  DTLS options will fail to be applied (as DTLS is not enabled), causing
	  the entire object set to be aborted.

	  This patch makes it so that we log a debug message when skipping a
	  field, and rumble on anyway.

	* main/format_cap: Parse capabilities generated by ast_format_cap_get_names

	  We have a strange relationship between the parsing of format
	  capabilities from a string and their representation as a string. We
	  expect the format capabilities to be expressed as a string in the
	  following format:

	  allow = !all,ulaw,alaw
	  disallow = g722

	  While we would generate the string representation of those formats as:

	  allow = (ulaw|alaw)
	  disallow = (ulaw|alaw|g729...)

	  When the configuration framework needs to store values as a string, it
	  generates the format capabilities using the second representation; this
	  representation however cannot be parsed when the entry is rehydrated.
	  This patch fixes that by updating
	  ast_format_cap_update_by_allow_disallow to parse an entry as if it were
	  in the generated format if it has a leading '(' and a trailing ')'.

	    channel driver that provides its own device state.

	* main/devicestate: Prevent duplicate registration of device state providers

	  Currently, the device state provider API will allow you to register a

	  providers will not be queried when a device's state has to be polled.
	  This patch updates the API such that a device state provider with the

	* bridge_native_rtp.c: Don't start native RTP bridging after attended transfer.

	  The bridge_native_rtp module adds a frame hook to channels which are in
	  a native RTP bridge. This frame hook is used to intercept when a hold
	  or unhold frame traverses the bridge so native RTP can be stopped or
	  started as appropriate. This is expected but exposes a specific bug
	  when attended transfers are involved.

	  Upon completion of an attended transfer an unhold frame is queued up
	  to take one of the channels involved off hold. After this is done
	  the channel is moved between bridges.

	  When the frame hook is involved in this case for the unhold it
	  releases the channel lock and acquires the bridge lock. This
	  allows the bridge core to step in and move the channel
	  (potentially changing the bridging techology) from another thread.
	  Once completed the bridge lock is released by the bridge core.
	  The frame hook is then able to acquire the bridge lock and
	  wrongfully starts native RTP again, despite the channel no longer
	  being in the bridge or needing to start native RTP. In fact at
	  this point the frame hook is no longer attached to the channel.

	  This change makes it so the native RTP bridge data is available to
	  the frame hook when it is invoked. Whether the frame hook has
	  been detached or not is stored on the native RTP bridge data and
	  is checked by the frame hook before starting or stopping native
	  RTP bridging. If the frame hook has been detached it does nothing.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Prevent simultaneous access to DTLS SSL context.

	  This change moves logic for setting up the DTLS SSL contexts to
	  when the SDP is done being processed instead of when ICE negotiation
	  completes. It also stops handshakes from being initiated when we
	  are acting as a server.

	  Manipulating the SSL context when ICE negotiation has completed
	  is problematic as the SSL context is not protected and if acting
	  as a client the remote side may have started DTLS negotiation
	  already.

	  The retransmission timeout timer code has also been split up
	  and simplified some. Both RTP and RTCP now have their own timers
	  and the points at which the timer is stopped and started is now
	  more specific. When a packet is sent the timer is started. When
	  a response is received but before it is processed the timer is
	  stopped. This provides a guarantee that the timeout is not
	  occurring while the response is processed.

	* res_pjsip: Need to use the same serializer for a pjproject SIP transaction.

	  All send/receive processing for a SIP transaction needs to be done under
	  the same threadpool serializer to prevent reentrancy problems inside
	  pjproject and res_pjsip.

	  * Add threadpool API call to get the current serializer associated with
	  the worker thread.

	  * Pick a serializer from a pool of default serializers if the caller of
	  res_pjsip.c:ast_sip_push_task() does not provide one.

	  This is a simple way to ensure that all outgoing SIP request messages are
	  processed under a serializer.  Otherwise, any place where a pushed task is
	  done that would result in an outgoing out-of-dialog request would need to
	  be modified to supply a serializer.  Serializers from the default
	  serializer pool are picked in a round robin sequence for simplicity.

	  A side effect is that the default serializer pool will limit the growth of
	  the thread pool from random tasks.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.

	  * Made pjsip_distributor.c save the thread's serializer name on the
	  outgoing request tdata struct so the response can be processed under the
	  same serializer.

	  This is a cherry-pick from master.

	* sorcery/realtime: Add a bit of debug and warning messages for bad configs

	  When a mapping does not exist between a sorcery.conf defined object and
	  a realtime mapping in extconf, currently, the user will receive a slew
	  of ERROR messages that don't really tell what is happening. Some ERROR
	  messages may even be misleading, as they occur after the sorcery API has
	  already given up on the attempt to load and create the sorcery object.

	  This patch adds a bit of debug and a useful WARNING message for when a
	  wizard's open callback fails for a particular object type. In the bad
	  configurations that resulted in this patch, this provided a 'root cause'
	  WARNING message that pointed in the right direction of the configuration
	  problem.

	* res_sorcery_realtime: Fix leak of sorcery object type.

	  This prevents a leak of a sorcery object type when realtime sorcery
	  objects are retrieved by fields or when multiple objects are retrieved.

	  The extent of this leak is that sorcery object types would be leaked.
	  These are allocated whenever an object type is registered with sorcery,
	  meaning that on module shutdown, these objects would be leaked. This
	  could be problematic if many reloads were performed, but it is not as
	  severe as if every sorcery object retrieved from realtime were being
	  leaked.

	* res/res_corosync: Always decline module load, instead of failing

	  Returns a 'failure' from the module load routine indicates to Asterisk
	  that it should abort loading completely. This is rarely - in fact,
	  really, never - a good option. Aborting load of Asterisk from a dynamic
	  module implies that the core, and the rest of the dynamic modules, don't
	  matter: we should abandon all processing.

	  res_corosync is really not that important.

	  This patch updates the module such that, if it fails to load, it
	  politely declines (emitting ERROR messages along the way), and allows
	  Asterisk to continue to function.

	  Note that this issue was keeping Asterisk unit tests from running on
	  certain build agents.

	* main/pbx: Resolve case sensitivity regression in PBX hints

	  When 8297136f was merged for ASTERISK-25040, a regression was introduced
	  surrounding the case sensitivity of device names within hints.
	  Previously, device names - such as 'sip/foo' - were compared in a case
	  insensitive fashion. Thus, 'sip/foo' was equivalent to 'SIP/foo'. After
	  that patch, only the case sensitive name would match, i.e., 'SIP/foo'.
	  As a result, some dialplan hints stopped working.

	  This patch re-introduces case insensitive matching for device names in
	  hints.

	* res_pjsip_nat: Adjust when contact should be rewritten.

	  A previous change made the contact only get rewritten if the dialog's
	  route set was not marked frozen. Unfortunately, while the intent of this
	  is correct, the dialog's route set actually gets marked as frozen
	  earlier than expected, especially for UAS dialogs.

	  Instead, the idea is that the contact needs to not be rewritten if there
	  is a pre-existing route set on the dialog. This is now accomplished by
	  checking the dialog's route set list instead of checking if the route
	  set is frozen.

	  Doing this causes some broken tests to begin passing again.

	* res_pjsip_nat: Rewrite route set when required.

	  When performing some provider testing, the rewrite_contact option was
	  interfering with proper construction of a route set when sending an ACK
	  after receiving a 200 OK response to an INVITE.

	  The initial INVITE was sent to address sip:foo. The 200 OK had a Contact
	  header with URI sip:bar. In addition, the 200 OK had Record-Route
	  headers for sip:baz and sip:foo, in that order. Since the Record-Route
	  headers had the lr parameter, the result should have been:

	  * Set R-URI of the ACK to sip:bar.
	  * Add Route headers for sip:foo and sip:baz, in that order.

	  However, the rewrite_contact option resulted in our rewriting the
	  Contact header on the 200 OK to sip:foo. The result was:

	  * R-URI remained sip:foo.
	  * We added Route headers for sip:foo and sip:baz, in that order.

	  The result was that sip:bar was not indicated in the ACK at all, so the
	  far end never received our ACK. The call eventually dropped.

	  The intention of rewrite_contact is to rewrite the most immediate
	  destination of our SIP request to be the same address on which we
	  received a request or response. In the case of processing a SIP response
	  with Record-Route headers, this means that instead of rewriting the
	  Contact header, we should instead rewrite the bottom-most Record-Route
	  header. In the case of processing a SIP request with Record-Route
	  headers, this means we rewrite the top-most Record-route header.
	  Like when we rewrite the Contact header, we also ensure to update
	  the dialog's route set if it exists.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration.c: Fix handle_client_state_destruction() refs

	  * handle_client_state_destruction() must always be passed a ref to
	  client_state because it will always unref client_state.
	  handle_registration_response() was not passing a client_state ref.

	  * Made the final un-REGISTER message get sent normally using the pjproject
	  register control structure in handle_client_state_destruction().  The
	  previous code attempted to short circuit the response handling for the
	  module to unload.  That doesn't work for a couple reasons.  One,
	  pjsip_regc_send() may call the registered callback before it returns and
	  unbalance the client_state ref count.  Two, the registered callback
	  handles any authentication for the un-REGISTER message.

	  * Made the distinction between internal registration state and external
	  registration status with sip_outbound_registration_status_str().  This is
	  necessary to avoid altering documented AMI messages with internal
	  changes.

	  * Removed references to client_state->client outside of the serializer
	  thread.  When handle_client_state_destruction() destroys the pjproject
	  register control structure that memory is freed and cannot be referenced
	  anymore.  These accesses were to provide information for debug and
	  off-nominal warning messages.

	  * In sip_outbound_registration_timer_cb() you should not access entry->id
	  after unrefing client_state because the passed in entry is normally
	  pointing to the timer entry in the client_state object.

	* channel: Remove ignore of answer on non-outgoing channels.

	  Due to the way that channels can now be moved around inside of
	  Asterisk it is possible for the outgoing flag of a channel to get
	  cleared before it has been answered. This results in the bridge
	  not receiving notification that the outgoing leg has been answered.

	  This most easily exhibits itself with DTMF based blond transfers.
	  Since the answer of the outgoing leg is ignored the other party
	  continues to receive both a locally generated ringing and the
	  media stream of the outgoing leg upon its answer. This results
	  in no media being heard.

	  This change removes the ignore of the answer and allows it
	  to pass through.

	* Resolve race conditions involving Stasis bridges.

	  This resolves two observed race conditions.

	  First, a bit of background on what the Stasis application does:

	  1a Creates a stasis_app_control structure. This structure is linked into
	     a global container and can be looked up using a channel's unique ID.
	  2a Puts the channel in an event loop. The event loop can exit either
	     because the stasis_app_control structure has been marked done, or
	     because of some other factor, such as a hangup. In the event loop, the
	     stasis_app_control determines if any specific ARI commands need to be
	     run on the channel and will run them from this thread.
	  3a Checks if the channel is bridged. If the channel is bridged, then
	     ast_bridge_depart() is called since channels that are added to Stasis
	     bridges are always imparted as departable.
	  4a Unlink the stasis_app_control from the container.

	  When an ARI command is received by Asterisk, the following occurs
	  1b A thread is spawned to handle the HTTP request
	  2b The stasis_app_control(s) that corresponds to the channel(s) in the
	     request is/are retrieved. If the stasis_app_control cannot be
	     retrieved, then it is assumed that the channel in question has exited
	     the Stasis app or perhaps was never in Stasis in the first place.
	  3b A command is queued onto the stasis_app_control, and the channel's
	     event loop thread is signaled to run the command.
	  4b While most ARI commands do nothing further, some, such as adding or
	     removing channels from a bridge, will block until the command they
	     issued has been completed by the channel's event loop.

	  The first race condition that is solved by this patch involves a crash
	  that can occur due to faulty detection of the channel's bridged status
	  in step 3a. What can happen is that in step 2a, the event loop may run
	  the ast_bridge_impart() function to asynchronously place the channel
	  into a bridge, then immediately exit the event loop because the channel
	  has hung up. In step 3a, we would detect that the channel was not
	  bridged and would not call ast_bridge_depart(). The reason that the
	  channel did not appear to be bridged was that the depart_thread that is
	  spawned by ast_bridge_impart() had not yet started. That is the thread
	  where the channel is marked as being bridged. Since we did not call
	  ast_bridge_depart(), the Stasis application would exit, and then the
	  channel would be destroyed Then the depart_thread would start up and
	  try to manipulate the destroyed channel, causing a crash.

	  The fix for this is to switch from using ast_channel_is_bridged() to
	  checking the NULLity of ast_channel_internal_bridge_channel() to
	  determine if ast_bridge_depart() needs to be called. The channel's
	  internal bridge_channel is set when ast_bridge_impart() is called and
	  is NULLed by the call to ast_bridge_depart(). If the channel's internal
	  bridge_channel is non-NULL, then the channel must have been imparted
	  into the bridge and needs to be departed, even if the actual bridging
	  operation has not yet started. By departing the channel when necessary,
	  the thread that is running the Stasis application will block until the
	  bridge gives the okay that the depart_thread has exited.

	  The second race condition that is solved by this patch involves a leak
	  of HTTP handler threads. The problem was that step 2b would successfully
	  retrieve a stasis_app_control structure. Then step 2a would exit the
	  channel from the event loop due to a hangup. Steps 3a and 4a would
	  execute, and then finally steps 3b and 4b would. The problem is that at
	  step 4b, when attempting to add a channel to a bridge, the thread would
	  block forever since the channel would never execute the queued command
	  since it was finished with the event loop. This meant that the HTTP
	  handling thread would be leaked, along with any references that thread
	  may have owned (in my case, I was seeing bridges leaked).

	  The fix for this is to hone in better on when the channel has exited the
	  event loop. The stasis_app_control structure has an is_done field that
	  is now set at each point where the channel may exit the event loop. If
	  step 2b retrieves a valid stasis_app_control structure but the control
	  is marked as done, then the attempted operation exits immediately since
	  there will be nothing to service the attempted command.

	* main/cdr: Carry over the disable flag when 'disable all' is specified

	  The CDR_PROP function (as well as the NoCDR application) set the
	  'disable all' flag (AST_CDR_FLAG_DISABLE_ALL) on the current CDR. This
	  flag is supposed to be applied to all CDRs that are currently in the
	  chain, as well as all CDRs that may be created in the future. Currently,
	  however, the flag is only applied to the existing CDRs in the chain; new
	  CDRs do not receive the 'disable all' flag. In particular, this affects
	  parallel dials, which generate new CDRs for each pair of channels in
	  the dial attempt.

	  This patch carries over the 'disable all' flag when it is specified on a
	  CDR and a new CDR is generated for the chain.

	* main/cdr: Copy context/exten on chained CDRs for parallel dials in subroutines

	  When a parallel dial occurs, a new CDR will be created for each dial
	  attempt that is made. In most circumstances, the act of creating each
	  CDR in the chain will include a step that updates the Party A snapshot,
	  which causes the context/extension of the Party A to be copied onto the
	  CDR object.

	  However, when the Party A is in a subroutine, we explicitly do *not*
	  copy the context/extension onto the CDR. This prevents the Macro or
	  GoSub routine name from blowing away the context/extension that the
	  channel was originally executing in. For the original CDR, this is not a
	  problem: the original CDR already recorded the last known 'good' state
	  of the channel just prior to it going into the subroutine. However, for
	  newly generated CDRs in a chain, there is no context/extension set on
	  them. Since we are in a subroutine, we will never set the Party A's
	  context/extension on the CDR, and we end up with a CDR with no
	  destination recorded on it.

	  This patch updates the creation of a chained CDR such that it copies
	  over the original CDR's context/extension. This is the last known "good"
	  state of the CDR, and is a reasonable starting point for the newly
	  generated CDR. In the case where we are not in a subroutine, subsequent
	  code will update the location of the CDR from the Party A information;
	  in the case where we are in a subroutine, the context/extension on the
	  original CDR is the correct information.

	* chan_sip.c: Update dialog fromtag after request with auth

	  If a client sends and INVITE which is 401 rejected, then subsequently
	  sends a new INVITE with the auth info and uses a different fromtag
	  from the first INVITE, Asterisk will accept the new INVITE as part of
	  the original dialog - match_req_to_dialog() specifically ignores the
	  fromtag. However it does not update the stored dialog with the new
	  fromtag.

	  This results in Asterisk being unable to match future packets that are
	  part of this dialog (such as the ACK to the OK or the OK to the BYE),
	  and the call is dropped.

	  This problem was originally found when using an NEC-i SV8100-GE (NEC SIP
	  Card).

	  * After a successful match of a packet to the dialog, if the packet is
	    not a SIP_RESPONSE, authentication is present and the fromtags are
	    different, the stored fromtag is updated with the one from the recent
	    INVITE.

	* chan_pjsip: Set the context and extension on the channel when created

	  Prior to this patch, chan_pjsip was failing to pass the endpoint's
	  context and the desired extension to the ast_channel_alloc_* routine.
	  This caused a new channel snapshot to be issued without a context and
	  extension, which can cause some reporting issues for users of AMI, CEL,
	  and other APIs. The channel driver would later set the context and
	  extension on the channel such that the channel would start in the
	  correct location in the dialplan, but the information reported in the
	  initial event would be incorrect.

	  This patch modifies the channel driver such that it now passes the
	  context and extension directly into the allocation routine. This
	  provides the information in the new channel snapshot published over
	  Stasis.

	* bridge: When performing a blonde transfer update connected line information.

	  When performing a blonde transfer the code uses the old masquerade
	  mechanism to move a channel around. As a result of this certain information,
	  such as connected line, is moved between the channels involved. Upon
	  completion of the move a frame is queued which is supposed to update the
	  connected line information on the channel. This does not occur as the
	  code considers it a redundant update since the masquerade operation
	  updated the channel (but did not inform it of the new connected line
	  information). The code also does not queue a connected line update
	  to be handled by the thread handling the channel. Without this any
	  other channel that may be loosely involved does not know it is
	  talking to a different caller.

	  This change does the following to resolve this:

	  1. The indicated connected line information is cleared upon
	  completion of the masquerade operation when doing a blonde transfer.
	  This prevents the connected line update from being considered
	  redundant.

	  2. A connected line update frame is now queued upon the completion
	  of the masquerade operation so any other channel loosely involved
	  knows that there is a different caller.

	* res_pjsip_transport_websocket: Fix use-after-free bugs.

	  This patch fixes use-after-free bugs caught by AddressSanitizer.

	  1. PJSIP transport manager may decide to destroy transport on its own.
	  For example, when the contact registered via websocket has not renewed
	  its registration in time. The transport was destoyed, but the websocket
	  listener thread was still active until the socket closes, and then tried
	  to call transport_shutdown on transport that has been freed.

	  Also, the transport destructor accessed wstransport->rdata.tp_info.pool
	  right after freeing memory that contained wstransport itself.

	  This patch converts transport to an ao2 object, allowing it to be
	  refcounted, so that it is available until both websocket listener and
	  pjsip transport manager are finished with it.

	  2. The websocket listener deletes the last reference on websocket session
	  when the tcp connection is closed, and it gets destroyed, but
	  the transport manager may still use it, for example when disconnect
	  happens in the middle of a SIP transaction.

	  A new reference to websocket session has been added that is released
	  with the transport to prevent this.

	* AMI: Escape string values.

	  So this issue is a bit complicated. Since it is possible to pass values to AMI
	  that contain a '\r\n' (or other similar sequences) these values need to be
	  escaped. One way to solve this is to escape the values and then pass the escaped
	  values to the AMI variable parameter string building function. However, this
	  puts the onus on the pre-build function to escape all string values. This
	  potentially requires a fair amount of changes along with a lot of string
	  allocations/freeing for all values.

	  Surely there is a way to push this complexity down a level into the string
	  building function itself? This of course is possible, but ends up requiring a
	  way to distinguish between strings that need to be escaped and those that don't.
	  The best way to handle this is by introducing a new format specifier in the
	  format string. For instance a %s (no escape) and %S (escape). However, that is
	  a bit weird and unexpected.

	  So faced with those possibilities this patch implements a limited version of the
	  first option. Instead of attempting to escape all string values this patch only
	  escapes those values that make sense. This approach limits the number of changes
	  and doesn't suffer from the odd format specifier problem.

	  forwarding.  This allows endpoint_internal_create to create

	  then allows it to do the forward to the tech's topic.

	  Incoming SIP packets larger than PJSIP_MAX_PKT_LEN were themselves
	  truncated before passing to pjsip_tpmgr_receive_packet, but the length
	  was passed unaltered, thus causing memory corruption and segfault.

	* Stasis: Fix unsafe use of stasis_unsubscribe in modules.

	  Many uses of stasis_unsubscribe in modules can be reached through unload.
	  These have been switched to stasis_unsubscribe_and_join.

	  Some subscription callbacks do nothing, for these I've created a noop
	  callback function in stasis.c.  This is used by some modules that monitor
	  MWI topics in order to enable cache, since the callback does not become
	  invalid after dlclose it is safe to use stasis_unsubscribe on these, even
	  during module unload.

	* res/ari: Register Stasis application on WebSocket attempt

	  Prior to this patch, when a WebSocket connection is made, ARI would not
	  be informed of the connection until after the WebSocket layer had
	  accepted the connection. This created a brief race condition where the
	  ARI client would be notified that it was connected, a channel would be
	  sent into the Stasis dialplan application, but ARI would not yet have
	  registered the Stasis application presented in the HTTP request that
	  established the WebSocket.

	  This patch resolves this issue by doing the following:
	   * When a WebSocket attempt is made, a callback is made into the ARI
	     application layer, which verifies and registers the apps presented in
	     the HTTP request. Because we do not yet have a WebSocket, we cannot
	     have an event session for the corresponding applications. Some
	     defensive checks were thus added to make the application objects
	     tolerant to a NULL event session.
	   * When a WebSocket connection is made, the registered application is
	     updated with the newly created event session that wraps the WebSocket
	     connection.

	* res_pjsip: Refactor endpt_send_transaction (qualify_timeout)

	  This patch refactors the transaction timeout processing to eliminate
	  calling the lower level public pjsip functions and reverts to calling
	  pjsip_endpt_send_request again.  This is the result of me noticing
	  a possible incompatibility with pjproject-2.4 which was causing
	  contact status flapping.

	  The original version of this feature used the lower level calls to
	  get access to the tsx structure in order to cancel the transaction
	  when our own timer expires. Since we no longer have that access,
	  if our own timer expires before the pjsip timer, we call the callbacks
	  and just let the pjsip transaction take it's own course.  When the
	  transaction ends, it discovers the callbacks have already been run
	  and just cleans itself up.

	  A few messages in pjsip_configuration were also added/cleaned up.

	* audiohook.c: Difference in read/write rates caused continuous buffer resets

	  Currently, everytime a sample rate change occurs (on read or write) the
	  associated factory buffers are reset. If the requested sample rate on a
	  read differed from that of a write then the buffers are continually reset
	  on every read and write. This has the side effect of emptying the buffer,
	  thus there being no data to read and then write to a file in the case of
	  call recording.

	  This patch fixes it so that an audiohook_list's rate always maintains the
	  maximum sample rate among hooks and formats. Audiohook sample rates are
	  only overwritten by this value when slin native compatibility is turned on.
	  Also, the audiohook sample rate can only overwrite the list's sample rate
	  when its rate is greater than that of the list or if compatibility is
	  turned off. This keeps the rate from constantly switching/resetting.

	* res/res_http_websocket: Add a pre-session established callback

	  This patch updates http_websocket and its corresponding implementation
	  with a pre-session established callback. This callback allows for
	  WebSocket server consumers to be notified when a WebSocket connection is
	  attempted, but before we accept it. Consumers can choose to reject the
	  connection, if their application specific logic allows for it.

	  As a result, this patch pulls out the previously private
	  websocket_protocol struct and makes it public, as
	  ast_websocket_protocol. In order to preserve backwards compatibility
	  with existing modules, the existing APIs were left as-is, and new APIs
	  were added for the creation of the ast_websocket_protocol as well as for
	  adding a sub-protocol to a WebSocket server.

	  In particular, the following new API calls were added:
	  * ast_websocket_add_protocol2 - add a protocol to the core WebSocket
	    server
	  * ast_websocket_server_add_protocol2 - add a protocol to a specific
	    WebSocket server
	  * ast_websocket_sub_protocol_alloc - allocate a sub-protocol object.
	    Consumers can populate this with whatever callbacks they wish to
	    support, then add it to the core server or a specified server.

	  a sorted vector.

	  AST_VECTOR_RESET which cleans all elements from the vector

	* pbx/pbx_spool: Fix issue when call files were executed too early

	  pbx_spool used to delete/move the call file upon successful outgoing
	  call completion, but did not delete it from in-memory list of files
	  (dirlist, used only when compiled with inotify/kqueue support).
	  That resulted in an extra attempt to process that filename after
	  retrytime seconds.
	  Then, if a new file with the same name appears that is scheduled
	  in future further than the completed one plus its retrytime,
	  then it gets executed earlier than expected.

	  This patch fixes remove_from_queue function to also remove the entry
	  from the dirlist.

	* res_pjsip_exten_state: Fix race condition between sending NOTIFY and termination

	  The res_pjsip_exten_state module currently has a race condition between
	  processing the extension state callback from the PBX core and processing
	  the subscription shutdown callback from res_pjsip_pubsub. There is currently
	  no synchronization between the two. This can present a problem as while
	  the SIP subscription will remain valid the tree it points to may not.
	  This is in particular a problem as a task to send a NOTIFY may get queued
	  which will try to use the tree that may no longer be valid.

	  This change does the following to fix this problem:

	  1. All access to the subscription tree is done within the task that
	  sends the NOTIFY to ensure that no other thread is modifying or
	  destroying the tree. This task executes on the serializer for the
	  subscriptions.

	  2. A reference to the subscription serializer is kept to ensure it
	  remains valid for the lifetime of the extension state subscription.

	  3. The NOTIFY task has been changed so it will no longer attempt
	  to send a NOTIFY if the subscription has already been terminated.

	  A bug in AST_VECTOR_INSERT_AT that could cause a seg fault.

	  WRT to CMP_MATCH and CMP_STOP behavior and the ability to return
	  a vector of matched entries.

	  A pre-existing issue with APPEND and REPLACE was also fixed.

	  I also added a new macro to test.h that acts like ast_test_validate
	  but also accepts a return code variable and a cleanup label.  As well
	  as printing the error, it sets the rc variable to AST_TEST_FAIL and
	  does a goto to the specified label on error.  I had a local version
	  of this in test_vector so I just moved it.

	  Creating a snoop channel in ARI and spying only on a single direction (in or

	* features: Fix crash when transferee hangs up during DTMF attended transfer.

	  A crash happens with this sequence of steps:
	  1) Party A is connected to party B.
	  2) Party B starts a DTMF attended transfer.
	  3) Party A hangs up while party B is dialing party C.

	  When party A hangs up the bridge that party A and party B are in is
	  dissolved and party B is kicked out of the bridge.  When party B finishes
	  dialing party C he attempts to move to the new bridge with party C.  Since
	  party B is no longer in a bridge the attempted move dereferences a NULL
	  bridge_channel pointer and crashes.

	  * Made the hold(), unhold(), ringing(), and the bridge_move() functions
	  tolerant of the channel not being in a bridge.  The assertion that party B
	  is always in a bridge is not true if the bridged peer of party B hangs up
	  and dissolves the bridge.  Being tolerant of not being in a bridge allows
	  the peer hangup stimulus to be processed by the FSM.

	  * Made the bridge_move() function return void since where the return value
	  for a failed move was checked generated a FSM coding ERROR message for a
	  normal off-nominal condition.

	  * Eliminated most uses of RAII_VAR in bridge_basic.c.

	* stasis: Fix dial masquerade datastore lifetime

	  A recent change went into Asterisk which added reference counts to the
	  channels stored in a dial masquerade datastore. Unfortunately this
	  included a reference to the caller in a dialing operation. While all
	  of the dialed targets have the datastore removed from them upon dialing
	  completion this did not occur for the caller, causing it to have a
	  reference to itself that could go never go away (as it depended on
	  the destruction of the datastore which only happened when the channel
	  was destroyed). This resulted in the caller channel remaining on the
	  system despite it having hung up.

	  This change does the following to fix this issue:

	  1. The dial masquerade datastore is now removed from the caller upon
	  dialing completion, just like the dialed targets.
	  2. Upon destruction of the caller all the dialed targets are also
	  removed from the dial masquerade datastore (just in case).
	  3. The reference to the caller has been removed as it should not be
	  possible for the datastore to now be valid/useful after the lifetime
	  of the caller has ended.

	  Renamed AST_VECTOR_INSERT to AST_VECTOR_REPLACE because it really

	  compatibility issues.

	  Added AST_VECTOR_INSERT_AT that actually inserts an element into the
	  vector at a specific index pushing existing elements to the right.

	  Added AST_VECTOR_GET_CMP that can retrieve from the vector based
	  on a user-provided compare function.

	  Added AST_VECTOR_CALLBACK function that will execute a function
	  for each element in the vector.  Similar to ao2_callback and
	  ao2_callback_data functions although the vector callback can take
	  a variable number of arguments.  This should allow easy migration
	  to a vector where a container might be too heavy.

	  Added read/write locked vector and lock manipulation macros.

	* main/pbx: Improve performance of dialplan reloads with a large number of hints

	  The PBX core maintains two hash tables for hints: a container of the
	  actual hints (hints), along with a container of devices that are watching that
	  hint (hintdevices). When a dialplan reload occurs, each hint in the hints
	  container is destroyed; this requires a lookup in the container of devices to
	  find the device => hint mapping object. In the current code, this performs an
	  ao2_callback, iterating over each of the device to hint objects in the
	  hintdevices container. For a large number of hints, this is extremely
	  expensive: dialplan reloads with 20000 hints could take several minutes
	  in just this phase.

	  This patch improves the performance of this step in the dialplan reloads
	  by caching which devices are watching a hint on the hint object itself.
	  Since we don't want to create a circular reference, we just cache the
	  name of the device. This allows us to perform a smarter ao2_callback on
	  the hintdevices container during hint removal, hashing on the name of the
	  device and returning an iterator to the matching names. The overall
	  performance improvement is rather large, taking this step down to a number of
	  seconds as opposed to minutes.

	  In addition, this patch also registers the hint containers in the PBX
	  core with the astobj2 library. This allows for reasonable debugging to
	  hash collisions in those containers.

	* Prevent potential crash on blond transfer.

	  Scenario:
	  Alice calls Bob. Bob performs a blond transfer to Carol. Carol rejects
	  the incoming call (or some other immediate circumstance causes Carol not
	  to answer the call)

	  What occurs in this case is that when the bridge between Alice and Bob
	  breaks, Alice is told to masquerade into Bob's channel that had placed
	  the call to Carol. The actual masquerade goes down without a hitch.
	  However, a channel fixup callback that attempts to publish dial events
	  over Stasis has a crash. The reason for this crash is that the datastore
	  on Bob's channel that placed the outbound call to Carol only had a bare
	  pointer to Carol's channel. Since Carol rejected the incoming call,
	  Carol's channel has been hung up and freed, meaning accessing her
	  channel results in a crash.

	  The fix here is simple. The dial fixup code has been altered to hold
	  references to the involved channels and to drop those references when
	  freeing data.

	* chan_dahdi: Add the chan_dahdi.conf force_restart_unavailable_chans option.

	  Some telco switches occasionally ignore ISDN RESTART requests.  The fix
	  for ASTERISK-19608 added an escape clause for B channels in the restarting
	  state if the telco ignores a RESTART request.  If the telco fails to
	  acknowledge the RESTART then Asterisk will assume the telco acknowledged
	  the RESTART on the second call attempt requesting the B channel by the
	  telco.  The escape clause is good for dealing with RESTART requests in
	  general but it does cause the next call for the restarting B channel to be
	  rejected if the telco insists the call must go on that B channel.

	  chan_dahdi doesn't really need to issue a RESTART request in response to
	  receiving a cause 44 (Requested channel not available) code.  Sending the
	  RESTART in such a situation is not required (nor prohibited) by the
	  standards.  I think chan_dahdi does this for historical reasons to deal
	  with buggy peers to get channels unstuck in a similar fashion as the
	  chan_dahdi.conf resetinterval option.

	  * Add the chan_dahdi.conf force_restart_unavailable_chans compatability
	  option that when disabled will prevent chan_dahdi from trying to RESTART
	  the channel in response to a cause 44 code.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Fix double unref on error return.

	  When the PJSIP pjsip_regc_send function is invoked and an error
	  status returned the caller currently decrements the reference count
	  of the client state that it just incremented, assuming the
	  registration callback would not have been invoked. In practice
	  this is not correct. If the failure happens after the transaction
	  has been set up the callback will still be invoked. This will
	  cause the reference count to be incorrectly decremented twice, once
	  by the registration callback and second by the caller of
	  pjsip_regc_send.

	  This change makes it so that whether the callback is invoked or
	  not is known by the caller of pjsip_regc_send. Depending on
	  this it can know whether it is responsible for decrementing the
	  reference count of the client state or not.

	  A previous set of patches (see: ASTERISK-22790 & ASTERISK-23231) made it so
	  a v.27 modem was not allowed to have a minimum transmission rate of 2400 bits
	  per second. This reverts all or some of those patches since according to the
	  v.27ter standard a rate of 2400 bits per second is also supported.

	  One of the original patches also added 9600 bits per second support for v.27.
	  This patch also removes that since v.27ter only supports 2400/4800 bits per
	  second.

	  Also, since Asterisk specifically supports v.27ter the enum was renamed to
	  better reflect this.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Don't fail on delayed processing: 13.

	  This is the Asterisk 13 version of a change to master that allows for
	  registration responses to be processed successfully potentially after
	  the original transaction has timed out. The main difference between this
	  and the master change is that the master version has API changes that
	  are unacceptable for 13. For 13, this is worked around by adding a new
	  API call that the outbound registration code uses instead.

	  The following is the text from the master version of this commit:

	  Odd behaviors have been observed during outbound registrations. The most
	  common problem witnessed has been one where a request with
	  authentication credentials cannot be created after receiving a 401
	  response. Other behaviors include apparently processing an incorrect SIP
	  response.

	  Inspecting the code led to an apparent issue with regards to how we
	  handle transactions in outbound registration code. When a response to a
	  REGISTER arrives, we save a pointer to the transaction and then push a
	  task onto the registration serializer. Between the time that we save the
	  pointer and push the task, it's possible for the transaction to be
	  destroyed due to a timeout. It's also possible for the address to be
	  reused by the transaction layer for a new transaction.

	  To allow for authentication of a REGISTER request to be authenticated
	  after the transaction has timed out, we now also hold a reference to the
	  original REGISTER request instead of the transaction. The function for
	  creating a request with authentication has been altered to take the
	  original request instead of the transaction where the original request
	  was sent.

	  Permanent contacts that hadn't been qualified yet were missing
	  their contact_status entries causing SEGVs when running CLI

	  This patch makes sure that contact_statuses are created for
	  both dynamic and permanent contacts when they are created.
	  It also adds checks in the CLI code to make sure there's a
	  contact_status, just in case.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_authenticator: Increase CSeq on authed requests.

	  The way PJSIP generates an authenticated request is to use a previous
	  request as a template. This means that the authenticated request will
	  have the same Call-ID, From header (including tag), and CSeq as the
	  original request. PJSIP generates a new branch on the Via header to
	  indicate that this is a new transaction, though.

	  There are some SIP implementations, though, that do not notice the
	  change in the branch and therefore will match the authed request to the
	  original request's transaction. Since the CSeq is the same, the server
	  will repeat the response it sent to the original request.

	  This patch aids interoperability by increasing the CSeq of the authed
	  request by one.

	* res_pjsip_t38: Don't crash on authenticated reinvite after originated T.38 FAX.

	  When Asterisk originates a channel to an application, the channel is
	  hung up once the application finishes executing. When the application
	  in question is SendFax, the Asterisk PJSIP code will attempt to reinvite
	  the T.38 session to audio after the FAX completes. The hangup of the
	  channel happens in the midst of this reinvite transaction. In most
	  circumstances, this works out okay because the BYE is delayed until the
	  reinvite transaction can complete.

	  However, if the reinvite that Asterisk sends receives a 401/407
	  response, then Asterisk's attempt to re-send the reinvite with
	  authentication will fail. This is because the session supplement in
	  res_pjsip_t38 makes the assumption that the channel on the session will
	  always be non-NULL. Since the channel has been hung up, though, the
	  channel is now NULL. Attempting to operate on the channel causes a
	  crash.

	  This patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the channel on the session
	  is not NULL before attempting to mess with the T.38 framehook.

	  This patch also contains some corrections for comments that were
	  incorrect and really confused me when I first started looking at the
	  code.

	* res_pjsip:  Validate that contact uris start with sip: or sips:

	  Currently we use pjsip_parse_hdr to validate contact uris but it

	  pass even though it has no scheme.  This causes SEGVs later on
	  whenever the uri is used.

	  To prevent this, permanent_contact_validate has been updated to check
	  that the scheme is either 'sip' or 'sips'.

	  2 uses of possibly-null endpoint have also been fixed in

	  On some systems, res_corosync isn't compatible with the installed version of

	  res_corosync check for its config file before attempting to call corosync apis
	  and return LOAD_DECLINE if there's no config file.  This lets Asterisk loading
	  continue.

	  If you have a res_corosync.conf file and res_corosync fails, you get the same
	  behavior as today and the fatal error tells you something is wrong with the

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Set the endpoint on SUBSCRIBE dialogs.

	  When SUBSCRIBE dialogs were established, we never associated
	  the endpoint that created the subscription with the dialog
	  we end up creating. In most cases, this ended up not causing
	  any problems.

	  The actual bug that was observed was that when a device that
	  was behind NAT established a subscription with Asterisk, Asterisk
	  would end up sending in-dialog NOTIFY requests to the device's
	  private IP addres instead of the public address of the NAT router.

	  When Asterisk receives the initial SUBSCRIBE from the device,
	  res_pjsip_nat rewrites the contact to the public address on which the
	  SUBSCRIBE was received. This allows for the dialog to have its target
	  address set to the proper public address. Asterisk then would send a 200
	  OK response to the SUBSCRIBE, then a NOTIFY with the initial
	  subscription state. The device would then send a 200 OK response to
	  Asterisk's NOTIFY.

	  Here's where things went wrong. When the 200 OK arrived, res_pjsip_nat
	  did not rewrite the address in the Contact header. Then, when the PJSIP
	  dialog layer processed the 200 OK, PJSIP would perform a comparison
	  between the IP address in the Contact header and its saved target
	  address for the dialog. Since they differed, PJSIP would update the
	  target dialog address to be the address in the Contact header. From this
	  point, if Asterisk needed to send a NOTIFY to the device, the result was
	  that the NOTIFY would be sent to the private address that the device
	  placed in the Contact header.

	  The reason why res_pjsip_nat did not rewrite the address when it
	  received the 200 OK response was that it could not associate the
	  incoming response with a configured endpoint. This is because on a
	  response, the only way to associate the response to an endpoint is by
	  finding the dialog that the response is associated with and then finding
	  the endpoint that is associated with that dialog. We do not perform
	  endpoint lookups on responses. res_pjsip_pubsub skipped the step of
	  associating the endpoint with the dialog we created, so res_pjsip_nat
	  could not find the associated endpoint and therefore couldn't rewrite
	  the contact.

	  This commit message is like 50x longer than the actual fix.

	* main/pbx: Don't attempt to destroy a previously destroyed exten/priority tuple

	  When a PBX registrar is unloaded, it will fail to remove its extension from
	  the context root_table if a dialplan application used by that extension is
	  still loaded. This can be the case for AGI, which can be unloaded after several
	  of the standard PBX providers. Often, this is harmless; however, if the
	  extension's priorities are removed during the failed unloading *and* the
	  dialplan application later unregisters, it leaves a ticking timebomb for the
	  next PBX provider that attempts to iterate over the extensions. When that
	  occurs, the peer_table pointer on the extension will already be set to NULL.
	  The current code does not check to see if the pointer is NULL before passing
	  it to a hashtab function this is not NULL tolerant.

	  Since it is possible for the peer_table to be NULL when we normally would not
	  expect that to be the case, the solution in this patch is to simply skip over
	  processing an extension's priorities if peer_table is NULL.

	  Prior to this patch, the tests/pbx/callerid_match test would crash during
	  module unload. With this patch, the test no longer crashes after running.

	* Merge "Detect potential forwarding loops based on count." into 13
2015-04-15 10:38 +0000 [4f1a8dbe92]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* Detect potential forwarding loops based on count.

	  A potential problem that can arise is the following:

	  * Bob's phone is programmed to automatically forward to Carol.
	  * Carol's phone is programmed to automatically forward to Bob.
	  * Alice calls Bob.

	  If left unchecked, this results in an endless loops of call forwards
	  that would eventually result in some sort of fiery crash.

	  Asterisk's method of solving this issue was to track which interfaces
	  had been dialed. If a destination were dialed a second time, then
	  the attempt to call that destination would fail since a loop was
	  detected.

	  The problem with this method is that call forwarding has evolved. Some
	  SIP phones allow for a user to manually forward an incoming call to an
	  ad-hoc destination. This can mean that:

	  * There are legitimate use cases where a device may be dialed multiple
	  times, or
	  * There can be human error when forwarding calls.

	  This change removes the old method of detecting forwarding loops in
	  favor of keeping a count of the number of destinations a channel has
	  dialed on a particular branch of a call. If the number exceeds the
	  set number of max forwards, then the call fails. This approach has
	  the following advantages over the old:

	  * It is much simpler.
	  * It can detect loops involving local channels.
	  * It is user configurable.

	  The only disadvantage it has is that in the case where there is a
	  legitimate forwarding loop present, it takes longer to detect it.
	  However, the forwarding loop is still properly detected and the
	  call is cleaned up as it should be.

	  Address review feedback on gerrit.

	  * Correct "mfgium" to "Digium"
	  * Decrement max forwards by one in the case where allocation of the
	    max forwards datastore is required.
	  * Remove irrelevant code change from pjsip_global_headers.c

	* pjsip_options: Add qualify_timeout processing and eventing

	  This is the second follow-on to https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4572/ and the
	  discussion at
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2015-March/073921.html

	  The basic issues are that changes in contact status don't cause events to be
	  emitted for the associated endpoint.  Only dynamic contact add/delete actions
	  update the endpoint.  Also, the qualify timeout is fixed by pjsip at 32 seconds
	  which is a long time.

	  This patch makes use of the new transaction timeout feature in r4585 and
	  provides the following capabilities...

	  1.  A new aor/contact variable 'qualify_timeout' has been added that allows the
	  user to specify the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a response to an
	  OPTIONS message.  The default is 3000ms.  When the timer expires, the contact is
	  marked unavailable.

	  2.  Contact status changes are now propagated up to the endpoint as follows...
	  When any contact is 'Available', the endpoint is marked as 'Reachable'.  When
	  all contacts are 'Unavailable', the endpoint is marked as 'Unreachable'.  The
	  existing endpoint events are generated appropriately.

	  at an earlier time in processing in hopes that the app name is available.

	  is now always present the crash can no longer occur.

	  discussion at
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2015-March/073921.html

	  Since we currently have no control over pjproject transaction timeout, this
	  patch pulls the pjsip_endpt_send_request function out of pjproject and into
	  res_pjsip/endpt_send_transaction in order to implement that capability.

	  Now when the transaction is initiated, we also schedule our own pj_timer with
	  our own desired timeout.

	  If the transaction completes before either timeout, pjproject cancels its timer,
	  and calls our tsx callback where we cancel our timer and run the app callback.

	  If the pjproject timer times out first, pjproject calls our tsx callback where
	  we cancel our timer and run the app callback.

	  If our timer times out first, we terminate the transaction which causes
	  pjproject to cancel its timer and call our tsx callback where we run the app
	  callback.

	  Regardless of the scenario, pjproject is calling the tsx callback inside the
	  group_lock and there are checks in the callback to make sure it doesn't run
	  twice.

	  As part of this patch ast_sip_send_out_of_dialog_request was created to replace
	  its similarly named private function.  It takes a new timeout argument in
	  milliseconds (<= 0 to disable the timeout).

	* res_pjsip: Add global option to limit the maximum time for initial qualifies

	  Currently when Asterisk starts initial qualifies of contacts are spread out
	  randomly between 0 and qualify_timeout to prevent network and system overload.
	  If a contact's qualify_frequency is 5 minutes however, that contact may be
	  unavailable to accept calls for the entire 5 minutes after startup.  So while
	  staggering the initial qualifies is a good idea, basing the time on
	  qualify_timeout could leave contacts unavailable for too long.

	  This patch adds a new global parameter "max_initial_qualify_time" that sets the
	  maximum time for the initial qualifies.  This way you could make sure that all
	  your contacts are initialy, randomly qualified within say 30 seconds but still
	  have the contact's ongoing qualifies at a 5 minute interval.

	  If max_initial_qualify_time is > 0, the formula is initial_interval =
	  min(max_initial_interval, qualify_timeout * random().  If not set,
	  qualify_timeout is used.

	  The default is "0" (disabled).

	* build_tools/make_version: Update version parsing for Git migration

	  External systems - such as the Asterisk Test Suite - require knowledge of the
	  upstream branch. Unfortunately, after moving to Git, the Asterisk version
	  currently consists of only a 'GIT" prefix followed by an object blob,
	  e.g., GIT-as08d7. This makes it difficult for such systems to know what
	  features are available in a particular check out of Asterisk.

	  This patch fixes this by hardcoding the branch in a variable in the
	  make_version script. Since the mainline branches are not changed often -
	  typically only once a year - this is a reasonable approach to solving
	  the problem, and is more reliable than parsing the output of 'git branch
	  -vv'. Branches that track off of an upstream primary branch will then get the
	  benefit of knowing which mainline branch they are currently based off
	  of.

	* git migration: Remove support for file versions

	  Git does not support the ability to replace a token with a version
	  string during check-in. While it does have support for replacing a
	  token on clone, this is somewhat sub-optimal: the token is replaced
	  with the object hash, which is not particularly easy for human
	  consumption. What's more, in practice, the source file version was often
	  not terribly useful. Generally, when triaging bugs, the overall version
	  of Asterisk is far more useful than an individual SVN version of a file.
	  As a result, this patch removes Asterisk's support for showing source file
	  versions.

	  Specifically, it does the following:
	  * main/asterisk:
	    - Refactor the file_version structure to reflect that it no longer
	      tracks a version field.
	    - Alter the "core show file version" CLI command such that it always
	      reports the version of Asterisk. The file version is no longer
	      available.

	  * main/manager: The Version key now always reports the Asterisk version.

	  * UPGRADE: Add notes for:
	    - Modification to the ModuleCheck AMI Action.
	    - Modification of the "core show file version" CLI command.

	* chan_pjsip/res_pjsip/bridge_softmix/core: Improve translation path choices.

	  With this patch, chan_pjsip/res_pjsip now sets the native formats to the
	  codecs negotiated by a call.

	  * The changes in chan_pjsip.c and res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c set the native
	  formats to include all the negotiated audio codecs instead of only the
	  initial preferred audio codec and later the currently received audio
	  codec.

	  * The audio frame handling in channel.c:ast_read() is more streamlined and
	  will automatically adjust to changes in received frame formats.  The new
	  policy is to remove translation and pass the new frame format to the
	  receiver except if the translation was to a signed linear format.  A more
	  long winded version is commented in ast_read() along with some caveats.

	  * The audio frame handling in channel.c:ast_write() is more streamlined
	  and will automatically adjust any needed translation to changes in the
	  frame formats sent.  Frame formats sent can change for many reasons such
	  as a recording is being played back or the bridged peer changed the format
	  it sends.  Since it is a normal expectation that sent formats can change,
	  the codec mismatch warning message is demoted to a debug message.

	  * Removed the short circuit check in
	  channel.c:ast_channel_make_compatible_helper().  Two party bridges need to
	  make channels compatible with each other.  However, transfers and moving
	  channels among bridges can result in otherwise compatible channels having
	  sub-optimal translation paths if the make compatible check is short
	  circuited.  A result of forcing the reevaluation of channel compatibility
	  is that the asterisk.conf:transcode_via_slin and codecs.conf:genericplc
	  options take effect consistently now.  It is unfortunate that these two
	  options are enabled by default and negate some of the benefits to the
	  changes in channel.c:ast_read() by forcing translation through signed
	  linear on a two party bridge.

	  * Improved the softmix bridge technology to better control the translation
	  of frames to the bridge.  All of the incoming translation is now normally
	  handled by ast_read() instead of splitting any translation steps between
	  ast_read() and the slin factory.  If any frame comes in with an unexpected
	  format then the translation path in ast_read() is updated for the next
	  frame and the slin factory handles the current frame translation.

	  This is the final patch in a series of patches aimed at improving
	  translation path choices.  The other patches are on the following reviews:

	* res_pjsip_config_wizard: Cleanup load unload

	  While investigating other unload issues I realized that the load/unload process 
	  for the config wizard was pretty ugly so I've refactored it as follows...

	  When the res_pjsip sorcery instance is created the config_wizard bumps it's own 
	  module reference to prevent it from unloading while the sorcery instance is 
	  still active.  When res_pjsip unloads and it's sorcery instance is destroyed, 
	  the config wizard unrefs itself which then allows itself to unload cleanly.  
	  Since the config wizard now can't load after res_pjsip or unload before it 
	  (which should have been the correct behavior all along), I was able to remove 
	  the chunks of code in both load_module and unload_module that handled that case.

	  Ran the testsuite tests to insure there were no functional changes and REF_DEBUG 
	  to insure that Asterisk was shutting down cleanly with no FRACKs or leaks.

	* translate.c: Only select audio codecs to determine the best translation choice.

	  Given a source capability of h264 and ulaw, a destination capability of
	  h264 and g722 then ast_translator_best_choice() would pick h264 as the
	  best choice even though h264 is a video codec and Asterisk only supports
	  translation of audio codecs.  When the audio starts flowing, there are
	  warnings about a codec mismatch when the channel tries to write a frame to
	  the peer.

	  * Made ast_translator_best_choice() only select audio codecs.

	  * Restore a check in channel.c:set_format() lost after v1.8 to prevent
	  trying to set a non-audio codec.

	  This is an intermediate patch for a series of patches aimed at improving
	  translation path choices for ASTERISK-24841.

	  This patch is a complete enough fix for ASTERISK-21777 as the v11 version
	  of ast_translator_best_choice() does the same thing.  However, chan_sip.c
	  still somehow tries to call ast_codec_choose() which then calls
	  ast_best_codec() with a capability set that doesn't contain any audio
	  formats for the incoming call.  The remaining warning message seems to be
	  a benign transient.

	* res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider: Fix reference leak on unload

	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider was leaking references to phoneprov objects due to 
	  a missing OBJ_NODATA in an ao2_callback in load_users().  Rather than adding the 
	  OBJ_NODATA, I changed load_users to use a more straightforward ao2_iterator.  
	  This plugged the leak but exposed an unload order issue between 
	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider, res_phoneprov and res_pjsip.

	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider unloads first, then res_phoneprov, then res_pjsip.  
	  Since res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider uses res_pjsip's sorcery instance, when it 
	  unloads, it's objects are still in the sorcery instance.  When res_pjsip 
	  unloads, it destroys all its objects including res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider's.  
	  The phoneprov destructor then attempts to unregister the extension from 
	  res_phoneprov but because res_phoneprov is already cleaned up, its users 
	  container is gone and we get a FRACK.

	  Simple solution, check for the NULL users container before attempting to remove 
	  the entry. Duh.

	  Ran tests/res_phoneprov/res_phoneprov_provider.  No leaks in 
	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider and no FRACKs.

	* loader/main: Don't set ast_fully_booted until deferred reloads are processed

	  Until we have a true module management facility it's sometimes necessary for one 
	  module to force a reload on another before its own load is complete.  If 
	  Asterisk isn't fully booted yet, these reloads are deferred.  The problem is 
	  that asterisk reports fully booted before processing the deferred reloads which 
	  means Asterisk really isn't quite ready when it says it is.

	  This patch moves the report of fully booted after the processing of the deferred 
	  reloads is complete.

	  Since the pjsip stack has the most number of related modules, I ran the 
	  channels/pjsip testsuite to make sure there aren't any issues.  All tests 
	  passed.

	* Bridging: Eliminate the unnecessary make channel compatible with bridge operation.

	  When a channel enters the bridging system it is first made compatible with
	  the bridge and then the bridge technology makes the channel compatible
	  with the technology.  For all but the DAHDI native and softmix bridge
	  technologies the make channel compatible with the bridge step is an
	  effective noop because the other technologies allow all audio formats.
	  For the DAHDI native bridge technology it doesn't matter because it is not
	  an initial bridge technology and chan_dahdi allows only one native format
	  per channel.  For the softmix bridge technology, it is a noop at best and
	  harmful at worst because the wrong translation path could be setup if the
	  channel's native formats allow more than one audio format.

	  This is an intermediate patch for a series of patches aimed at improving
	  translation path choices.

	* Security/tcptls: MitM Attack potential from certificate with NULL byte in CN.

	  When registering to a SIP server with TLS, Asterisk will accept CA signed
	  certificates with a common name that was signed for a domain other than the
	  one requested if it contains a null character in the common name portion of
	  the cert. This patch fixes that by checking that the common name length
	  matches the the length of the content we actually read from the common name
	  segment. Some certificate authorities automatically sign CA requests when
	  the requesting CN isn't already taken, so an attacker could potentially
	  register a CN with something like www.google.com\x00www.secretlyevil.net
	  and have their certificate signed and Asterisk would accept that certificate
	  as though it had been for www.google.com - this is a security fix and is
	  noted in AST-2015-003.

	* bridge.c: Hangup attended transfer target after it has been swapped out

	  After completing an attended transfer the transfer target channel (the one that
	  gets swapped out) was not being hung up after leaving the bridge. This resulted
	  in a channel possibly being left around. Added an explicit softhangup for the
	  channel in question after the transfer is successfully completed in order to
	  make sure the channel is hung up.

	* Do not queue message requests that we do not respond to.

	  If we receive a MESSAGE request that we cannot send a response
	  to, we should not send the incoming MESSAGE to the dialplan.

	  This commit should help the bouncing message_retrans test to
	  pass consistently.

	* ARI: Add the ability to intercept hold and raise an event

	  For some applications - such as SLA - a phone pressing hold should not behave
	  in the fashion that the Asterisk core would like it to. Instead, the hold
	  action has some application specific behaviour associated with it - such as
	  disconnecting the channel that initiated the hold; only playing MoH to channels
	  in the bridge if the channels are of a particular type, etc.

	  One way of accomplishing this is to use a framehook to intercept the
	  hold/unhold frames, raise an event, and eat the frame. Tasty. This patch
	  accomplishes that using a new dialplan function, HOLD_INTERCEPT.

	  In addition, some general cleanup of raising hold/unhold Stasis messages was
	  done, including removing some RAII_VAR usage.

	* Ensure that a non-zero sample rate is returned for all formats.

	  Versions of Asterisk prior to 12 defaulted to 8000 as a sample rate
	  if one was not provided by a format. In Asterisk 13, this was removed.
	  The result was that some calculations which involve dividing by the
	  sample rate resulted in dividing by 0. The fix being put in place
	  here is to have the same default fallback that was present in previous
	  versions of Asterisk.

	* ParkedCall: Don't allow dialplan fallthrough after retrieving parked call.

	  This is a change to align behavior with that of Asterisk 11 and previous versions.
	  In those versions, if a parked call were retrieved, and the call ended, the parked
	  call retriever would be hung up after the ParkedCall application ran. Prior to this
	  patch, in Asterisk 13, the same situation would result in the parked call retriever
	  falling through to additional priorities in the extension where the ParkedCall
	  application was called. With this patch, the behavior between Asterisk 11 and 13
	  aligns.

	* stasis: set a channel variable on websocket disconnect error

	  When an error occurs while writing to a web socket, the web socket is
	  disconnected and the event is logged. A side-effect of this, however, is that
	  any application on the other side waiting for a response from Stasis is left
	  hanging indefinitely (as there is no mechanism presently available for
	  notifying interested parties about web socket error states in Stasis).

	  To remedy this scenario, this patch introduces a new channel variable:
	  STASISSTATUS.

	  The possible values for STASISSTATUS are:
	  SUCCESS         - The channel has exited Stasis without any failures
	  FAILED          - Something caused Stasis to croak. Some (not all) possible
	                    reasons for this:
	                      - The app registry is not instantiated;
	                      - The app requested is not registered;
	                      - The app requested is not active;
	                      - Stasis couldn't send a start message

	* main/stdtime/localtime: Fix warning introduced in r433720

	  The patch in r433720 caused a warning to be kicked back by gcc. It occurred
	  due to this check in unistd.h:

	      if (__nbytes > __bos0 (__buf))
	          return __read_chk_warn (__fd, __buf, __nbytes, __bos0 (__buf));

	  That is, if __nbytes is greater than the result of GCC's built-in object size
	  for the struct, we'll kick back a warning.

	  As it turns out, this is because there is an error in the code in the patch.
	  We are passing the address of the pointer to the struct, not iev, which is a
	  pointer to the struct. Hence, the number of bytes is probably going to be lot
	  larger than the number of bytes that make up a pointer! This patch changes
	  the code just read from the pointer to the struct - which fixes the warning.

	* clang compiler warnings: Fix warning for -Wgnu-variable-sized-type-not-at-end

	  This patch fixes a warning caught by clang, wherein a variable sized struct is
	  not located at the end of a struct. While the code in question actually
	  expected this, this is a good warning to watch for. Hence, this patch refactors
	  the code in question to not have two variable length elements in the same
	  struct.

	* clang compiler warnings: Fix -Wself-assign

	  Assigning a variable to itself isn't super useful. However, the WAV format
	  modules make use of this in order to perform byte endian checks. This patch
	  works around the warning by only performing the self assignment if we are
	  going to do more than just assign it to ourselves. Which is odd, but true.

	  up all instances where equality, not assignment, was intended between two
	  parantheses.

	* Add stateful PJSIP response API call, and use it for out-of-dialog responses.

	  Asterisk had an issue where retransmissions of MESSAGE requests resulted in
	  Asterisk processing the retransmission as if it were a new MESSAGE request.

	  This patch fixes the issue by creating a transaction in PJSIP on the incoming
	  request. This way, if a retransmission arrives, the PJSIP transaction layer
	  will resend the response and Asterisk will not ever see the retransmission.

	* res/res_timing_kqueue: Update the module to conform to current timer API

	  This patch updates the kqueue timing module to conform to current timer API.

	  This fixes issues with using the kqueue timing source on Asterisk 13 on
	  FreeBSD 10. These issues include:

	  - Remove support for kevent64().  The values used to support Asterisk timers
	    fit within 32bits and so can be handled on all platforms via kevent().

	  - Provide debug logging for, but do not track, unacked events.  This matches
	    the behavior of all other timer implementations.

	  - Implement continuous mode by triggering and leaving active, a user event.
	    This ensures that the file descriptor for the timer returns immediately from
	    poll(), without placing the load of a high speed timer on the kernel.

	  - In kqueue_timer_get_max_rate(), don't overstate the capability of the timer.
	    On some platforms, UINT_MAX is greater than INTPTR_MAX, the largest integer
	    type kqueue supports for timers.

	  - In kqueue_timer_get_event(), assume the caller woke up from poll() and just
	    return the mode the timer is currently in. This matches all other timer
	    implementations.

	  - Adjust the test code now that unacked events are not tracked.

	* Improved and portable ast_log recursion avoidance

	  This introduces a new logger routine ast_log_safe.  This routine should be
	  used for all error messages in code that can be run as a result of ast_log.
	  ast_log_safe does nothing if run recursively.  All error logging in
	  astobj2.c, strings.c and utils.h have been switched to ast_log_safe.

	  This required adding support for raw threadstorage.  This provides direct
	  access to the void* pointer in threadstorage.  In ast_log_safe, NULL is used
	  to signify that this thread is not already running ast_log_safe, (void*)1 when
	  it is already running.  This was done since it's critical that ast_log_safe
	  do nothing that could log during recursion checking.

	* Replace most uses of ast_register_atexit with ast_register_cleanup.

	  Since 'core stop now' and 'core restart now' do not stop modules,
	  it is unsafe for most of the core to run cleanups.  Originally all
	  cleanups used ast_register_atexit, and were only changed when it
	  was shown to be unsafe.  ast_register_atexit is now used only when
	  absolutely required to prevent corruption and close child processes.

	  Exceptions that need to use ast_register_atexit:
	  * CDR: Flush records.
	  * res_musiconhold: Kill external applications.
	  * AstDB: Close the DB.
	  * canary_exit: Kill canary process.

	* chan_pjsip: Add "rpid_immediate" option to prevent unnecessary "180 Ringing" messages.

	  Incoming PJSIP call legs that have not been answered yet send unnecessary
	  "180 Ringing" or "183 Progress" messages every time a connected line
	  update happens.  If the outgoing channel is also PJSIP then the incoming
	  channel will always send a "180 Ringing" or "183 Progress" message when
	  the outgoing channel sends the INVITE.

	  Consequences of these unnecessary messages:

	  * The caller can start hearing ringback before the far end even gets the
	  call.

	  * Many phones tend to grab the first connected line information and refuse
	  to update the display if it changes.  The first information is not likely
	  to be correct if the call goes to an endpoint not under the control of the
	  first Asterisk box.

	  When connected line first went into Asterisk in v1.8, chan_sip received an
	  undocumented option "rpid_immediate" that defaults to disabled.  When
	  enabled, the option immediately passes connected line update information
	  to the caller in "180 Ringing" or "183 Progress" messages as described
	  above.

	  * Added "rpid_immediate" option to prevent unnecessary "180 Ringing" or
	  "183 Progress" messages.  The default is "no" to disable sending the
	  unnecessary messages.

	  regression caused in FILE read operation When r432935 was merged,
	  it did correctly fix a situation where a FILE read operation on
	  the middle of a file buffer would not read the requested length
	  in the parameters passed to the FILE function. Unfortunately, it
	  would also allow the FILE function to append more bytes than what
	  was available in the buffer if the length exceeded the end of the
	  buffer length. This patch takes the minimum of the remaining
	  bytes in the buffer along with the calculated length to append
	  provided by the original patch, and uses that as the length to
	  append in the return result. This patch also updates the unit
	  tests with the scenarios that were originally pointed out in
	  ASTERISK-21765 that the original implementation treated

	* /, main/format_cap.c: main/frame: Don't report empty disallow
	  values as an error In realtime, it is normal to have a database
	  with both 'allow' and 'disallow' columns in the schema. It is

	  and no 'disallow' value. Unlike in static conf files, you can't
	  *not* provide the disallow value. Thus, the empty disallow value
	  causes a spurious WARNING message, which is kind of annoying.
	  This patch makes it so that a 'disallow' value with no ... value
	  ... is ignored. Granted, you can still screw this up as well, as
	  technically specifying 'disallow=all,!ulaw' allows only ulaw, and
	  then you would have no 'allow' value in your database. But

	* /, main/audiohook.c: main/audiohook: Update internal sample rate
	  on reads When an audiohook is created (which is used by the
	  various Spy applications and Snoop channel in Asterisk 13+), it
	  initially is given a sample rate of 8kHz. It is expected,
	  however, that this rate may change based on the media that passes
	  through the audiohook. However, the read/write operations on the
	  audiohook behave very differently. When a frame is written to the
	  audiohook, the format of the frame is checked against the
	  internal sample rate. If the rate of the format does not match
	  the internal sample rate, the internal sample rate is updated and
	  a new SLIN format is chosen based on that sample rate. This works
	  just fine. When a frame is read, however, we do something quite
	  different. If the format rate matches the internal sample rate,
	  all is fine. However, if the rates don't match, the audiohook
	  attempts to "fix up" the number of samples that were requested.
	  This can result in some seriously large number of samples being
	  requested from the read/write factories. Consider the worst case
	  - 192kHz SLIN. If we attempt to read 20ms worth of audio produced
	  at that rate, we'd request 3840 samples (192000 / (1000 / 20)).
	  However, if the audiohook is still expecting an internal sample
	  rate of 8000, we'll attempt to "fix up" the requested samples to:
	  samples_converted = samples * (ast_format_get_sample_rate(format)
	  / (float) audiohook->hook_internal_samp_rate); which is: 92160 =
	  3840 * (192000 / 8000) This results in us attempting to read
	  92160 samples from our factories, as opposed to the 3840 that we
	  actually wanted. On a 64-bit machine, this miraculously survives
	  - despite allocating up to two buffers of length 92160 on the
	  stack. The 32-bit machines aren't quite so lucky. Even in the
	  case where this works, we will either (a) get way more samples
	  than we wanted; or (b) get about 3840 samples, assuming the
	  timing is pretty good on the machine. Either way, the calculation
	  being performed is wrong, based on the API users expectations. My
	  first inclination was to allocate the buffers on the heap. As it
	  is, however, there's at least two drawbacks with doing this: (1)
	  It's a bit complicated, as the size of the buffers may change
	  during the lifetime of the audiohook (ew). (2) The stack is
	  faster (yay); the heap is slower (boo). Since our calculation is
	  flat out wrong in the first place, this patch fixes this issue by
	  instead updating the internal sample rate based on the format
	  passed into the read operation. This causes us to read the
	  correct number of samples, and has the added benefit of setting
	  the audihook with the right SLIN format. Note that this issue was
	  caught by the Asterisk Test Suite as a result of r432195 in the
	  13 branch. Because this issue is also theoretically possible in
	  Asterisk 11, the change is being made here as well. Review:

	* Makefile, include/asterisk/utils.h, /, configure, main/Makefile,
	  configure.ac, include/asterisk/inline_api.h, makeopts.in: Add
	  support for the clang compiler; update RAII_VAR to use
	  BlocksRuntime RAII_VAR, which is used extensively in Asterisk to
	  manage reference counted resources, uses a GCC extension to
	  automatically invoke a cleanup function when a variable loses

	  use of the BlocksRuntime, which allows for a closure to be
	  created that performs the actual cleanup. Note that this does not
	  attempt to address the numerous warnings that the clang compiler

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, /: app_voicemail: Fix crash with IMAP
	  backends when greetings aren't present When an IMAP backend is in
	  use and greetings are set to be used, but aren't present for a
	  user in their IMAP folder, Asterisk will crash. This occurs due
	  to the mailstream being set to the 'greetings' folder and being
	  left in that particular state, regardless of the success/failure
	  of the attempt to access the folder the mailstream points to.
	  Later access of the mailstream assumes that it points to the
	  'INBOX' (or some other folder), resulting in either a crash (if
	  the greetings folder didn't exist and the mailstream is invalid)
	  or an inability to read messages from the 'INBOX' folder. This
	  patch restores the mailstream to its correct state after
	  accessing the greetings. This fixes the crash, and sets the
	  mailstream to the state that VoiceMailMain expects. Note that
	  while ASTERISK-23390 also contained a patch for this issue, the
	  patch on ASTERISK-24786 is the one being merged here. Review:

	* /, main/stdtime/localtime.c: localtime: Fix file descriptor leak
	  on kqueue(2) systems The localtime management in the Asterisk
	  core contains a thread that watches for changes in the local
	  timezone. On systems where the directory containing
	  /etc/localtime is modified frequently, the thread monitoring the
	  changes will be woken up to determine if any changes in timezone
	  have occurred. When using kqueue(2), this can cause a leak of
	  file descriptors due to some improper management of resources.
	  This patch updates the kqueue(2) handling in localtime, such that
	  is no longer leaks resources. Review:

	* main/translate.c: translate: Prevent invalid memory accesses on
	  fast shutdown When a 'core restart now' or 'core stop now' is
	  executed and a channel is currently in a media operation, the
	  translator matrix can be destroyed while a channel is currently
	  blocked on getting the best translation choice (see
	  ast_translator_best_choice). When the channel gets the mutex, the
	  translation matrix now has invalid memory, and Asterisk crashes.
	  This patch does two things: (1) We now only clean up the
	  translation matrix on a graceful shutdown. In that case, there
	  are no channels, and so there is no risk of this occurring. (2)
	  We also now set the __matrix and __indextable to NULL. In some
	  initial backtraces when this occurred, it looked as if there was
	  a memory corruption occurring, and it wasn't until we determined
	  that something had restarted Asterisk that the issue became
	  clear. By setting these to NULL on shutdown, it becomes a bit
	  easier to determine why a crash is occurring. Note that we could
	  litter the code with NULL checks on the __matrix, but the act of
	  making the translation matrix cleaned up on shutdown should
	  preclude this issue from occurring in the first place, and this
	  part of the code needs to be as fast as possible. Review:

	* include/asterisk/dial.h, main/dial.c: Dial API: add self destruct

	  while the calling thread is allowed to go on about other
	  business. The only alternative to this option would be the
	  calling thread spawning a new thread, or hanging around itself
	  waiting to destroy the dial struct after completion. Example of
	  use (minus error checking): struct ast_dial *dial =
	  ast_dial_create(); ast_dial_append(dial, "PJSIP", "200", NULL);
	  ast_dial_option_global_enable(dial, AST_DIAL_OPTION_ANSWER_EXEC,
	  "Echo"); ast_dial_option_global_enable(dial,
	  AST_DIAL_OPTION_SELF_DESTROY, NULL); ast_dial_run(dial, NULL, 1);
	  The dial_run call will return almost immediately after spawning
	  the new thread to run and monitor the dial. If the call is
	  answered, it is placed into the echo app. When completed, it will
	  call ast_dial_destroy() on the dial structure. Note that any

	* main/sdp_srtp.c, /: channels/sip/sdp_crypto: Handle SRTP keys
	  negotiated with key lifetime/MKI Prior to this patch, SDP offers
	  negotiating SDES-SRTP crypto attributes would be rejected if
	  those crypto attributes contained either a key lifetime or a MKI
	  parameter. While from a theoretical point of view this was
	  defensible - Asterisk does not support key lifetimes or multiple
	  crypto keys - from a practical point of view, this is quite a
	  problem. A large number of endpoints offer lifetimes/MKI, which
	  Asterisk can tolerate so long as it doesn't actually have to
	  support anything more than a single key or refresh the key. In
	  reality, this is (so far as we've seen) always the case. This
	  patch is a forward port of Olle's work in the
	  lingon-srtp-key-lifetime-1.8 branch. To quote Olle from
	  ASTERISK-17721, it handles lifetime/MKI parameters in the
	  following fashion: > The Lingon branch now handle lifetime and
	  MKI parameters. > > We only accept lifetimes up to max for the
	  crypto and higher than 10 hours > for packetization of 20 ms (50
	  pps). > > We only handle MKI with index 1. > > We do not really
	  bother with counting packets and reinviting at end of > lifetime,
	  so the min of 10 hours kind of takes care of most calls. If there
	  > are longer ones, we rely on the other side for re-invites. > >
	  It's still not perfect, but I personally think this is an
	  improvement. A > configuration option for minimum lifetime
	  accepted could be added. When the patch was ported forward, I
	  decided against adding a configuration option as Olle's handling
	  was more than sufficient for every case I've seen come through
	  the issue tracker or through interoperability testing. We can
	  revisit that decision if it proves to be false. A few small other
	  tweaks were made to the surrounding code to reduce indentation
	  and provide better type safety for the 'tag' parameter. Review:

	* res/res_http_websocket.c, /: Increase WebSocket frame size and

	  [chan_respoke][], require a larger frame size than the default
	  8k; this patch bumps the default to 16k. This patch also fixes
	  some problems exacerbated by large frames. The sanity counter was
	  decremented on every fread attempt in ws_safe_read(), regardless
	  of whether data was read from the socket or not. For large
	  frames, this could result in loss of sanity prior to reading the
	  entire frame. (16k frame / 1448 bytes per segment = 12 segments).
	  This patch changes the sanity counter so that it only decrements
	  when fread() doesn't read any bytes. This more closely matches
	  the original intention of ws_safe_read(), given that the error
	  message is "Websocket seems unresponsive". This patch also
	  properly logs EOF conditions, so disconnects are no longer
	  confused with unresponsive connections. [chan_respoke]:

	  res/ari/resource_channels.c: ARI/PJSIP: Apply requesting
	  channel's format cap to created channels This patch addresses the
	  following problems: * ari/resource_channels: In ARI, we currently
	  create a format capability structure of SLIN and apply it to the
	  new channel being created. This was originally done when the PBX
	  core was used to create the channel, as there was a condition
	  where a newly created channel could be created without any
	  formats. Unfortunately, now that the Dial API is being used, this
	  has two drawbacks: (a) SLIN, while it will ensure audio will
	  flows, can cause a lot of needless transcodings to occur,
	  particularly when a Local channel is created to the dialplan.
	  When no format capabilities are available, the Dial API handles
	  this better by handing all audio formats to the requsted
	  channels. As such, we defer to that API to provide the format
	  capabilities. (b) If a channel (requester) is causing this
	  channel to be created, we currently don't use its format
	  capabilities as we are passing in our own. However, the Dial API
	  will use the requester channel's formats if none are passed into
	  it, and the requester channel exists and has format capabilities.
	  This is the "best" scenario, as it is the most likely to create a
	  media path that minimizes transcoding. Fixing this simply entails
	  removing the providing of the format capabilities structure to
	  the Dial API. * chan_pjsip: Rather than blindly picking the first
	  format in the format capability structure - which actually *can*
	  be a video or text format - we select an audio format, and only
	  pick the first format if that fails. That minimizes the weird
	  scenario where we attempt to transcode between video/audio. *
	  res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Applied the joint capapbilites to the format
	  structure. Since ast_request already limits us down to one format
	  capability once the format capabilities are passed along, there's
	  no reason to squelch it here. * channel: Fixed a comment. The
	  reason we have to minimize our requested format capabilities down
	  to a single format is due to Asterisk's inability to convey the
	  format to be used back "up" a channel chain. Consider the
	  following: PJSIP/A => L;1 <=> L;2 => PJSIP/B g,u,a g,u,a g,u,a u
	  That is, we have PJSIP/A dialing a Local channel, where the
	  Local;2 dials PJSIP/B. PJSIP/A has native format capabilities
	  g722,ulaw,alaw; the Local channel has inherited those format
	  capabilities down the line; PJSIP/B supports only ulaw. According
	  to these format capabilities, ulaw is acceptable and should be
	  selected across all the channels, and no transcoding should
	  occur. However, there is no way to convey this: when L;2 and
	  PJSIP/B are put into a bridge, we will select ulaw, but that is
	  not conveyed to PJSIP/A and L;1. Thus, we end up with: PJSIP/A
	  <=> L;1 <=> L;2 <=> PJSIP/B g g X u u Which causes g722 to be
	  written to PJSIP/B. Even if we can convey the 'ulaw' choice back
	  up the chain (which through some severe hacking in Local channels
	  was accomplished), such that the chain looks like: PJSIP/A <=>
	  L;1 <=> L;2 <=> PJSIP/B u u u u We have no way to tell PJSIP/A's
	  *channel driver* to Answer in the SDP back with only 'ulaw'. This
	  results in all the channel structures being set up correctly, but
	  PJSIP/A *still* sending g722 and causing the chain to fall apart.
	  There's a lot of difficulty just in setting this up, as there are
	  numerous race conditions in the act of bridging, and no clean
	  mechanism to pass the selected format backwards down an
	  established channel chain. As such, the best that can be done at
	  this point in time is clarifying the comment. Review:

	* /, bridges/bridge_softmix.c: bridge_softmix: G.729 codec license
	  held When more than one call using the same codec type enters

	  collision crash. A multi-asterisk box setup with direct media
	  enabled would occasionally crash when two re-INVITE collisions on
	  a call leg happen in a row. The re-INVITE logic only had one
	  timer struct to defer the re-INVITE. When the second collision
	  happens the timer struct is overwritten and put into the timer
	  heap again. Resources for the first timer are leaked and the heap
	  has two positions occupied by the same timer struct. Now the heap
	  ordering is potentially corrupted, the timer will fire twice, and
	  any resources allocated for the second timer will be released
	  twice. * The solution is to put the collided re-INVITE into the
	  delayed requests queue with all the other delayed requests and
	  cherry pick the next request that can come off the queue when an
	  event happens. * Changed to put delayed BYE requests at the head
	  of the delayed queue. There is no sense in processing delayed
	  UPDATEs and re-INVITEs when a BYE has been requested. * Made the
	  start of a BYE request flush the delayed requests queue to
	  prevent a delayed request from overlapping the BYE transaction. I
	  saw a few cases where a delayed re-INVITE got started after the
	  BYE transaction started. * Changed the delayed_request struct to
	  use an enum instead of a string for the request method. Cherry
	  picking the queue is easier with an enum than string comparisons
	  and the compiler can warn if a switch statement does not cover
	  all defined enum values. * Improved the debug output to give more
	  information. It helps to know which channel is involved with an
	  endpoint. Trunks can have many channels associated with the

	  handling of the Transfer dialplan application/ARI redirect
	  capability. *New Feature* A new operation has been added to the
	  ARI channels resource, redirect. With this, a channel in a Stasis
	  application can be redirected to another endpoint of the same
	  underlying channel technology. *Bug fixes* In the process of
	  writing this new feature, two bugs were fixed in the PJSIP stack:
	  (1) The existing .transfer channel callback had the limitation
	  that it could only transfer channels to a SIP URI, i.e., you had
	  to pass 'PJSIP/sip:foo@my_provider.com' to the dialplan
	  application. While this is still supported, it is somewhat
	  unintuitive - particularly in a world full of endpoints. As such,
	  we now also support specifying the PJSIP endpoint to transfer to.
	  (2) res_pjsip_multihomed was, unfortunately, trying to 'help' a
	  302 redirect by updating its Contact header. Alas, that resulted
	  in the forwarding destination set by the dialplan application/ARI
	  resource/whatever being rewritten with very incorrect
	  information. Hence, we now don't bother updating an outgoing
	  response if it is a 302. Since this took a looong time to find,
	  some additional debug statements have been added to those modules
	  that update the Contact headers. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: channels/chan_sip: Fix RealTime error
	  during SIP unregistration with MariaDB When a SIP device that has
	  its registration stored in RealTime unregisters, the entry for
	  that device is updated with blank values, i.e., "", indicating
	  that it is no longer registered. Unfortunately, one of those
	  values that is 'blanked' is the device's port. If the column type
	  for the port is not a string datatype (the recommended type is
	  integer), an ODBC or database error will be thrown. MariaDB does
	  not coerce empty strings to a valid integer value. This patch
	  updates the query run from chan_sip such that it replaces the
	  port value with a value of '0', as opposed to a blank value. This
	  is the value that other database backends coerce the empty string
	  ("") to already, and the handling of reading a RealTime
	  registration value from a backend already anticipates receiving a
	  port of '0' from the backends. ASTERISK-24772 #close Reported by:

	  is the endpoint's context. There's no default for

	  eventually crashes. A response is never received because the

	  res/res_pjsip.c: res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Fix reload race
	  condition. Performing a CLI "module reload" command when there
	  are new pjsip.conf registration objects defined frequently failed
	  to load them correctly. What happens is a race condition between
	  res_pjsip pushing its reload into an asynchronous task processor
	  task and the thread that does the rest of the reloads when it
	  gets to reloading the res_pjsip_outbound_registration module. A
	  similar race condition happens between a reload and the CLI/AMI
	  show registrations commands. The reload updates the
	  current_states container and the CLI/AMI commands call
	  get_registrations() which builds a new current_states container.
	  * Made res_pjsip.c reload_module() use
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() instead of ast_sip_push_task() to
	  eliminate two threads processing config reloads at the same time.
	  * Made get_registrations() not replace the global current_states
	  container so the CLI/AMI show registrations command cannot
	  interfere with reloading. You could never add/remove objects in
	  the container without the possibility of the container being
	  replaced out from under you by get_registrations(). * Added a
	  registration loaded sorcery instance observer to purge any dead
	  registration objects since get_registrations() cannot do this job
	  anymore. The struct ast_sorcery_instance_observer callbacks must
	  be used because the callback happens inline with the load
	  process. The struct ast_sorcery_observer callbacks are pushed to
	  a different thread. * Added some global current_states NULL
	  pointer checks in case the container disappears because of
	  unload_module(). * Made sorcery's struct
	  ast_sorcery_instance_observer.object_type_loaded callbacks
	  guaranteed to be called before any struct
	  ast_sorcery_observer.loaded callbacks will be called. * Moved the
	  check for non-reloadable objects to before the sorcery instance
	  loading callbacks happen to short circuit unnecessary work.
	  Previously with non-reloadable objects, the sorcery instance
	  loading/loaded callbacks would always happen, the individual
	  wizard loading/loaded would be prevented, and the non-reloadable
	  type logging message would be logged for each associated wizard.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: stale nonce causes failure When
	  refreshing (with a small expiration) a registration that was sent
	  to chan_sip the nonce would be considered stale and reject the
	  registration. What was happening was that the initial
	  registration's "dialog" still existed in the dialogs container
	  and upon refresh the dialog match algorithm would choose that as
	  the "dialog" instead of the newly created one. This occurred
	  because the algorithm did not check to see if the from tag
	  matched if authentication info was available after the 401. So,
	  it ended up assuming the original "dialog" was a match and
	  stopped the search. The old "dialog" of course had an old nonce,
	  thus the stale nonce message. This fix attempts to leave the
	  original functionality alone except in the case of a REGISTER. If
	  a REGISTER is received if searches for an existing "dialog"
	  matching only on the callid. If the expires value is low enough

	  (take 2) Due to the original patch causing memory corruptions it
	  was removed until the problem could be resolved. This patch is
	  the original patch plus some added locking around stasis router
	  subcription that was needed to avoid the memory corruption.
	  Description of the original problem and patch (still applicable):
	  The res_pjsip module was previously unloadable. With this patch
	  it can now be unloaded. This patch is based off the original
	  patch on the issue (listed below) by Corey Farrell with a few
	  modifications. Namely, removed a few changes not required to make
	  the module unloadable and also fixed a bug that would cause
	  asterisk to crash on unloading. This patch is the first step
	  (should hopefully be followed by another/others at some point) in
	  allowing res_pjsip and the modules that depend on it to be
	  unloadable. At this time, res_pjsip and some of the modules that
	  depend on res_pjsip cannot be unloaded without causing problems
	  of some sort. The goal of this patch is to get res_pjsip and only
	  res_pjsip to be able to unload successfully and/or shutdown
	  without incident (crashes, leaks, etc...). Other dependent
	  modules may still cause problems on unload. Basically made sure,
	  with the patch applied, that res_pjsip (with no other dependent
	  modules loaded) could be succesfully unloaded and Asterisk could
	  shutdown without any leaks or crashes that pertained directly to
	  res_pjsip. ASTERISK-24485 #close Reported by: Corey Farrell

	  This patch improves the documentation of ARI on the wiki.

	  allowed ranges weren't documented. This was particularly
	  frustrating, as Asterisk would reject query parameters with
	  disallowed values - but we didn't tell anyone what the allowed
	  values were. * The /play/id operation on /channels and /bridges
	  failed to document all of the added media resource types. *
	  Documentation for creating a channel into a Stasis application
	  failed to note when it occurred, and that creating a channel into
	  Stasis conflicts with creating a channel into the dialplan. *
	  Some other minor tweaks in the mustache templates, including

	  fixes the issue by copying the menu name over to the user profile
	  when the menu hooks are applied to the user. Since that function
	  now does a little bit more than just apply the hooks, the name of
	  the function has been changed to cover the copying of the menu
	  name over as well. In addition, there is a disparity between the
	  menu name length as it is stored on the conf_menu structure and
	  the confbridge_user structure; this patch makes the lengths match

	* main/config.c: dynamic realtime: Updates fail to work due to
	  update fields being passed over When a crash was fixed due to
	  usage of the REALTIME function in r423003, a regression was
	  introduced into ast_update2_realtime where the update fields
	  passed to the function would be skipped and the lookup field
	  processed twice. The use of this function is a bit interesting: A
	  variable argument list is used with two sentinel values - the
	  first marks the end of the lookup fields/values; the second marks
	  the end of the update fields/values. Unfortunately,
	  ast_update2_realtime parses over the lookup fields twice, as
	  opposed to parsing over the update fields. This causes the
	  lookups to succeed, but the updates itself to have no effect.
	  Note that the most common instance of this problem occurred in
	  app_voicemail during the updating of a mailbox password. Thanks
	  to the issue reporter, Paddy Grice, for pointing out the problem.

	* res/stasis/app.c, res/stasis/stasis_bridge.c: stasis transfer:
	  fix a race condition on stasis bridge push After a bridge
	  transfer completes where a local replacement channel is used, a
	  stasis transfer message with the details of the transfer is sent.
	  This is processed by stasis which then sets the stasis app name
	  and replaced channel snapshot on the replacement channel.
	  However, since a separate thread was already started to run
	  stasis on the new replacement channel, a race was on to see if
	  the message processing would be completed before the app name was
	  needed, otherwise the channel would be hung up. This change moves

	  snapshot to the bridge_stasis_push function callback from the
	  bridge transfer logic, allowing the steps to be completed earlier
	  and more deterministically, and the race elimianted. NOTE: the

	  values, the Dial application will take some action upon the
	  channels involved in the dial operation (such as hanging up a
	  particular party, etc.) The Dial application ensures that a
	  Stasis message is published in the event that
	  MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT returns a value that kills the dial
	  operation, so that there is a corresponding DialEnd event
	  published in AMI/ARI for the DialBegin event that preceeded it. A
	  bug exists where that same DialEnd event will be published on
	  Stasis even if the value returned in MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT is
	  not one that the Dial application cares about. This causes two
	  DialEnd events to be published - one with the
	  MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT and another with "ANSWERED" - which is
	  all sorts of wrong. This patch fixes the bug by ensuring that we

	* res/res_pjsip_multihomed.c, res/res_pjsip.c: res_pjsip /
	  res_pjsip_multihomed: Use the correct transport and addressing
	  information on UAS sessions. The first thing this patch fixes is
	  UAS dialogs. Previously if a transport was configured on an
	  endpoint and an inbound session was created there was no
	  guarantee that requests sent on the dialog would use the correct
	  transport and address information. This has now been fixed so an
	  explicitly configured transport is taken into account. The second
	  thing this patch fixes is res_pjsip_multihomed. The
	  res_pjsip_multihomed module attempts to determine what transport
	  a message should go out on and what addressing information should
	  go into the message itself. In a scenario where multiple
	  transports exist bound to the same IP address but a different
	  port the code would incorrectly alter the transport and change
	  the message to the wrong transport. This change makes the
	  res_pjsip_multihomed module smarter so it will only change the
	  transport and address information in the message when it is
	  possible and makes sense. ASTERISK-24615 #close Reported by:

	  res_pjsip: make it unloadable The res_pjsip module was previously
	  unloadable. With this patch it can now be unloaded. This patch is
	  based off the original patch on the issue (listed below) by Corey
	  Farrell with a few modifications. Namely, removed a few changes
	  not required to make the module unloadable and also fixed a bug
	  that would cause asterisk to crash on unloading. This patch is
	  the first step (should hopefully be followed by another/others at
	  some point) in allowing res_pjsip and the modules that depend on
	  it to be unloadable. At this time, res_pjsip and some of the
	  modules that depend on res_pjsip cannot be unloaded without
	  causing problems of some sort. The goal of this patch is to get
	  res_pjsip and only res_pjsip to be able to unload successfully
	  and/or shutdown without incident (crashes, leaks, etc...). Other
	  dependent modules may still cause problems on unload. Basically
	  made sure, with the patch applied, that res_pjsip (with no other
	  dependent modules loaded) could be succesfully unloaded and
	  Asterisk could shutdown without any leaks or crashes that
	  pertained directly to res_pjsip. ASTERISK-24485 #close Reported

	* res/res_pjsip_pubsub.c: res_pjsip_pubsub: Fix persistent
	  subscriptions not surviving graceful shutdown If you do a 'core
	  (shutdown|restart) graceful' persistent subscriptions won't
	  survive. If you do a 'core (shutdown|restart) now' or asterisk
	  terminates for some reason, they do. Here's why... When asterisk
	  shuts down gracefully, it sends a 'NOTIFY/terminated' to
	  subscribers for each subscription. This not only tells the
	  subscribers that the dialog/state machine is done, it also frees
	  the last reference to the subscription tree which causes the
	  persistent subscription to get deleted from astdb. When asterisk
	  restarts, nothing's left. Just preventing the delete from astdb
	  doesn't work because we already told the subscriber to terminate
	  the dialog so we can't restart it even if it was still in astdb.
	  Everything works OK if asterisk terminates unexpectedly because
	  we never send the 'terminated' message so on restart, the
	  subscription is still in astdb and the subscriber is none the
	  wiser. This patch suppresses the sending of 'NOTIFY/terminated'
	  on shutdown for persistent connections. Tested-by: George Joseph

	* res/res_pjsip_outbound_registration.c:
	  res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Fix several reload issues There
	  are 2 issues with reloading registrations... 1. The
	  'can_reuse_registration' test wasn't considering the intervals or
	  expiration in its determination of whether a registration changed
	  or not so if you changed any of the intervals or the expiration
	  and reloaded, the object would get reloaded but the actual timers
	  wouldn't change. can_reuse_registration now does a sorcery diff
	  on the old and new objects instead of discretely testing certain
	  fields. Now if you change expiration for instance, and reload,
	  the timer is updated and re-registration will occur on the new
	  value. 2. If you mung up your password on an outbound
	  registration you get a permanent failure. If you fix the password
	  (on the outbound_auth object) and reload, nothing tells
	  outbound_registration to try again because the registration
	  itself didn't change. This patch adds an observer on the "auth"
	  object type and if any auth changes, existing registration states
	  are searched and those in a REJECTED_PERMANENT state are retried.

	  Add option to NOT preserve effective context when changing a
	  template Let's say you have a template T with variable VAR1 = ON
	  and you have a context C(T) that doesn't specify VAR1. If you
	  read C, the effective value of VAR1 is ON. Now you change T VAR1
	  to OFF and call ast_config_text_file_save. The current behavior
	  is that the file gets re-written with T/VAR1=OFF but C/VAR1=ON is
	  added. Personally, I think this is a bug. It's preserving the
	  effective state of C even though I didn't specify C/VAR1 in th
	  first place. I believe the behavior should be that if I didn't
	  specify C/VAR1 originally, then the effective value of C/VAR1
	  should continue to follow the inherited state. Now, if I DID
	  explicitly specify C/VAR1, the it should be preserved even if the
	  template changes. Even though I think the existing behavior is a
	  bug, it's been that way forever so I'm not changing it. Instead,
	  I've created ast_config_text_file_save2() that takes a bitmask of
	  flags, one of which is to preserve the effective context (the
	  current behavior). The original ast_config_text_file_save calls
	  *2 with the preserve flag. If you want the new behavior, call *2
	  directly without a flag. I've also updated Manager UpdateConfig
	  with a new parameter 'PreserveEffectiveContext' whose default is
	  'yes'. If you want the new behavior with UpdateConfig, set
	  'PreserveEffectiveContext: no'. Tested-by: George Joseph Review:

	  scheduled register proceed normally. I don't think that's a good
	  idea. If you unregister, it should stay unregistered until you
	  decide to start registrations again. So this patch just adds a
	  cancel_registration call to the current unregister_task to cancel
	  the timer. Of course, now you need a way to start registration
	  again so I've added a 'pjsip send register' command that
	  unregisters and cancels any existing registration (the same as
	  send unregister), then sends an immediate registration and starts
	  the timer back up again. Both changes also ripple to AMI. There's
	  a new PJSIPRegister command. There's no harm in calling either
	  command repeatedly. They don't care about the actual state.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Send CANCEL via original INVITE
	  destination even after UPDATE request Given the following
	  scenario: * Three SIP phones (A, B, C), all communicating via a
	  proxy with Asterisk * A call is established between A and B. B
	  performs a SIP attended transfer of A to C. B sets the call on
	  hold (A is hearing MOH) and dials the extension of C. While phone
	  C is ringing, B transfers the call (that is, what we typically
	  call a 'blond transfer'). * When the transfer completes, A hears
	  the ringing of phone C, while B is idle. In the SIP messaging for
	  the above scenario, a REFER request is sent to transfer the call.
	  When "sendrpid=yes" is set in sip.conf, Asterisk may send an
	  UPDATE request to phone C to update party information. This
	  update is sent directly to phone C, not through the intervening
	  proxy. This has the unfortunate side effect of providing route
	  information, which is then set on the sip_pvt structure for C. If
	  someone (e.g. B) is trying to get the call back (through a
	  directed pickup), Asterisk will send a CANCEL request to C.
	  However, since we have now updated the route set, the CANCEL
	  request will be sent directly to C and not through the proxy. The
	  phone ignores this CANCEL according to RFC3261 (Section 9.1).
	  This patch updates reqprep such that the route is not updated if
	  an UPDATE request is being sent while the INVITE state is
	  INV_PROCEEDING or INV_EARLY_MEDIA. This ensures that a subsequent
	  CANCEL request is still sent to the correct location. Review:

	* main/lock.c, /, include/asterisk/lock.h: DEBUG_THREADS: Fix
	  regression and lock tracking initialization problems. This patch
	  started with David Lee's patch at
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2826/ and includes a
	  regression fix introduced by the ASTERISK-22455 patch. The
	  initialization of a mutex's lock tracking structure was not
	  protected in a critical section. This is fine for any mutex that
	  is explicitly initialized, but a static mutex may have its lock
	  tracking double initialized if multiple threads attempt the first
	  lock simultaneously. * Added a global mutex to properly serialize
	  initialization of the lock tracking structure. The painful global
	  lock can be mitigated by adding a double checked lock flag as
	  discussed on the original review request. * Defer lock tracking
	  initialization until first use. * Don't be "helpful" and
	  initialize an uninitialized lock when DEBUG_THREADS is enabled.
	  Debug code is not supposed to fix or change normal code behavior.
	  We don't need a lock initialization race that would force a
	  re-setup of lock tracking. Lock tracking already handles
	  initialization on first use. * Properly handle allocation
	  failures of the lock tracking structure. * No need to initialize
	  tracking data in __ast_pthread_mutex_destroy() just to turn
	  around and destroy it. The regression introduced by
	  ASTERISK-22455 is the result of manipulating a pthread_mutex_t
	  struct outside of the pthread library code. The pthread_mutex_t
	  struct seems to have a global linked list pointer member that can
	  get changed by other threads. Therefore, saving and restoring the
	  contents of a pthread_mutex_t struct is a bad thing. Thanks to
	  Thomas Airmont for finding this obscure regression. * Don't
	  overwrite the struct ast_lock_track.reentr_mutex member to
	  restore tracking data in __ast_cond_wait() and
	  __ast_cond_timedwait(). The pthread_mutex_t struct must be
	  treated as a read-only opaque variable. Miscellaneous other items
	  fixed by this patch: * Match ast_suspend_lock_info() with
	  ast_restore_lock_info() in __ast_cond_timedwait(). * Made some
	  uninitialized lock sanity checks return EINVAL and try a
	  DO_THREAD_CRASH. * Fix bad canlog initialization expressions.

	* channels/chan_pjsip.c: chan_pjsip: Race between channel answer
	  and bridge setup when using direct media When direct media is
	  enabled and a pjsip channel is answered a race would occur
	  between the handling of the answer and bridge setup. Sometimes
	  the media negotiation would take place after the native bridge
	  was setup. This resulted in a NULL media address, which in turn
	  resulted in Asterisk using its address as the remote media
	  address when sending a reinvite. This patch makes the chan_pjsip
	  answer handler synchronous thus alleviating the race condition
	  (the bridge won't start setting things up until after it

	* res/res_pjsip_session.c: res_pjsip_session: Fix issue where a

	  In the past the SDP negotiation within res_pjsip_session was made
	  more tolerant of certain situations. The only case where SDP
	  negotiation will fail is when a major error occurs during
	  negotiation. Receiving an already declined media stream is not
	  considered a major error. When producing the local SDP the logic
	  took this into account so on the initial INVITE the declined
	  media stream did not cause an SDP negotiation failure.
	  Unfortunately the logic for handling media streams with a handler
	  did not mirror this logic and considered an already declined
	  media stream an error and thus failed the SDP negotiation. This
	  change makes the logic between both situations match so only
	  under major errors will the SDP negotiation fail. ASTERISK-24607

	  description does a fine job of summarizing this, so here it is: A
	  reporter discovered that Asterisk would crash when attempting to
	  retransmit a reinvite that had previously received a 491
	  response. The crash occurred because a pjsip_tx_data structure
	  was being saved for reuse, but its reference count was not being
	  increased. The result was that the pjsip_tx_data was being freed
	  before we were actually done with it. When we attempted to re-use
	  the structure when re-sending the reinvite, Asterisk would crash.
	  The fix implemented here is not to try holding onto the
	  pjsip_tx_data at all. Instead, when we reschedule sending the
	  reinvite, we create a brand new pjsip_tx_data and send that
	  instead. Because of this change, there is no need for an
	  ast_sip_session_delayed_request structure to have a pjsip_tx_data
	  on it any more. So any code referencing its use has been removed.
	  When this initial fix was introduced, I encountered a second
	  crash when processing a subsequent 200 OK on a rescheduled
	  reinvite. The reason was that when rescheduling the reinvite, we
	  gave the wrong location for a response callback. This has been
	  fixed in this patch as well. ASTERISK-24556 #close Reported by

	  condition between the raising of test AMI events (which drive

	  Prior to this patch, the Stasis messages published to the test
	  topic were not forwarded to the AMI topic. Instead, the code in
	  manager had a dedicated handler for test messages that was
	  independent of the topics forwarded to the AMI topic. This
	  results in no synchronization between the test messages and the
	  rest of the Stasis messages published out over AMI. In some test
	  with very tight timing constraints, this can result in out of
	  order messages and spurious test failures. Properly forwarding
	  the Test Suite topic to the AMI topic ensures that the messages
	  are synchronized properly. This patch does that, and moves the
	  message handling to the Stasis definition of the Test Suite
	  message in test.c as well. Review:

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, /: apps/app_voicemail: Fix crash with IMAP
	  when streams are opened simultaneously The UW IMAP library is
	  instrinsically not thread-safe, and relies upon higher level
	  applications to guarantee thread safety. For the most part, this
	  is provided by the vms object, which provides locking for
	  individual streams. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient for
	  calls to mail_open which create the IMAP stream. mail_open can,
	  on some systems, call into a UW IMAP specific function for
	  determining the address of a system based on a hostname,
	  ip_nametoaddr. In the ip6_unix implementation of this function,
	  static variables are used to hold parsing buffers. This can cause
	  a crash if multiple threads attempt to convert a hostname to an
	  address at the same time. Locking on a single mail stream is not
	  sufficient to prevent simultaneous access to these static
	  variables. In the IMAP library, this function can be called from
	  the mail_open and imap_status functions. As the imap_status
	  function is not used by app_voicemail, locking on access to
	  mail_open is sufficient to prevent any mangling of the buffers.

	  Allow subscriptions to use a threadpool for message delivery
	  Prior to this patch, all Stasis subscriptions would receive a
	  dedicated thread for servicing published messages. In contrast,
	  prior to r400178 (see review
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2881/), the subscriptions
	  shared a thread pool. It was discovered during some initial work
	  on Stasis that, for a low subscription count with high message
	  throughput, the threadpool was not as performant as simply having
	  a dedicated thread per subscriber. For situations where a
	  subscriber receives a substantial number of messages and is
	  always present, the model of having a dedicated thread per
	  subscriber makes sense. While we still have plenty of
	  subscriptions that would follow this model, e.g., AMI, CDRs, CEL,
	  etc., there are plenty that also fall into the following two
	  categories: * Large number of subscriptions, specifically those
	  tied to endpoints/peers. * Low number of messages. Some
	  subscriptions exist specifically to coordinate a single message -
	  the subscription is created, a message is published, the delivery
	  is synchronized, and the subscription is destroyed. In both of
	  the latter two cases, creating a dedicated thread is wasteful
	  (and in the case of a large number of peers/endpoints, harmful).
	  In those cases, having shared delivery threads is far more
	  performant. This patch adds the ability of a subscriber to Stasis
	  to choose whether or not their messages are dispatched on a
	  dedicated thread or on a threadpool. The threadpool is
	  configurable through stasis.conf. Review:

	* /, apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c: app_confbridge:
	  Don't play leader leaving prompt if no one will hear it Consider
	  the following: - A marked user in a conference - One or more
	  end_marked only users in the conference When the marked users
	  leaves, we will be in the conf_state_multi_marked state. This
	  currently will traverse the users, kicking out any who have the
	  end_marked flags. When they are kicked, a full ast_bridge_remove
	  is immediately called on the channels. At this time, we also
	  unilaterally set the need_prompt flag. When the need_prompt flag
	  is set, we then playback a sound to the bridge informing everyone
	  that the leader has left; however, no one is left in the bridge.
	  This causes some odd behaviour for the end_marked users - they
	  are stuck waiting for the bridge to be unlocked. This results in
	  them waiting for 5 or 6 seconds of dead air before hearing that
	  they've been kicked. Unfortunately, we do have to keep the bridge
	  locked while we're playing back the 'leader-has-left' prompt. If
	  there are any wait_marked users in the conference, this behaviour
	  can't be easily changed - but we do make the case of the
	  end_marked users better with this patch. Review:

	  res/stasis/app.c: Fix race condition that could result in ARI
	  transfer messages not being sent. From reviewboard: "During blind
	  transfer testing, it was noticed that tests were failing
	  occasionally because the ARI blind transfer event was not being
	  sent. After investigating, I detected a race condition in the
	  blind transfer code. When blind transferring a single channel,
	  the actual transfer operation (i.e. removing the transferee from
	  the bridge and directing them to the proper dialplan location) is
	  queued onto the transferee bridge channel. After queuing the
	  transfer operation, the blind transfer Stasis message is
	  published. At the time of publication, snapshots of the channels
	  and bridge involved are created. The ARI subscriber to the blind
	  transfer Stasis message then attempts to determine if the bridge
	  or any of the involved channels are subscribed to by ARI
	  applications. If so, then the blind transfer message is sent to
	  the applications. The way that the ARI blind transfer message
	  handler works is to first see if the transferer channel is
	  subscribed to. If not, then iterate over all the channel IDs in
	  the bridge snapshot and determine if any of those are subscribed
	  to. In the test we were running, the lone transferee channel was
	  subscribed to, so an ARI event should have been sent to our
	  application. Occasionally, though, the bridge snapshot did not
	  have any channels IDs on it at all. Why? The problem is that
	  since the blind transfer operation is handled by a separate
	  thread, it is possible that the transfer will have completed and
	  the channels removed from the bridge before we publish the blind
	  transfer Stasis message. Since the blind transfer has completed,
	  the bridge on which the transfer occurred no longer has any
	  channels on it, so the resulting bridge snapshot has no channels
	  on it. Through investigation of the code, I found that attended
	  transfers can have this issue too for the case where a transferee
	  is transferred to an application." The fix employed here is to
	  decouple the creation of snapshots for the transfer messages from
	  the publication of the transfer messages. This way, snapshots can
	  be created to reflect what they are at the time of the transfer
	  operation. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4135

	* main/rtp_engine.c, /: main/rtp_engine: Fix crash when processing
	  more than one RTCP report info block Asterisk - in
	  res_rtp_asterisk - only understands a single RTCP report info
	  block. When the RTCP information was refactored in the RTP Engine
	  to be pushed over the Stasis message bus, I put in the hooks into
	  the engine to handle multiple RTCP report info blocks, in the
	  hope that a future RTP implementation would be able to provide
	  that data. Unfortunately, res_rtp_asterisk has a tendency to
	  "lie": (1) It will send RTCP reports with a
	  reception_report_count greater than 1 (which is pulled directly
	  from the RTCP packet itself, so that part is correct) (2) It will
	  only provide a single report block When the rtp_engine goes to
	  convert this to a JSON blob, hilarity ensues as it looks for a
	  report block that doesn't exist. This patch updates the
	  rtp_engine to be a bit more skeptical about what it is presented
	  with. While this could also be fixed in res_rtp_asterisk, this
	  patch prefers to fix it in the engine for two reasons: (1) The
	  engine is designed to work with multiple RTP implementation, and
	  hence having it be more robust is a good thing (tm) (2)
	  res_rtp_asterisk's handling of RTCP information is "fun". It
	  should report the correct reception_report_count; ideally it
	  should also be giving us all of the blocks - but it is

	* /, bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c: bridge_native_rtp: Fix T.38
	  issues with remote bridges After r425242 the
	  fax/sip/directmedia_reinvite_t38 test started failing due to the
	  surviving channel not being re-INVITEd back from T.38 to audio.
	  This patch fixes that bug - a deeper explanation of what happened
	  follows. When two RTP channels are in a native bridge, the
	  bridging layer will investigate each via the get_rtp_info glue
	  callback. This callback returns the native bridge preference of
	  the channel *at that moment in time* (that part is key). At
	  different points during the bridging, the native bridging layer
	  will inform the RTP capable channels of the status of the bridge
	  via the update_peer glue callback. In a T.38 scenario with audio
	  direct media, the sequence of events will often look like the
	  following: * SIP/A and SIP/B both have audio and enter a native
	  bridge. * Asterisk re-INVITEs audio between SIP/A and SIP/B
	  directly (via an update_peer callback). * SIP/A sends a re-INVITE
	  to T.38, which causes Asterisk to send a re-INVITE to T.38 to
	  SIP/B. Assuming everyone 200 OKs the process, the UDPTL stack
	  receives UDPTL packets in Asterisk from both endpoints. From the
	  perspective of the channels, we are now in a local bridge for
	  T.38, even though we are technically still in a remote bridge in
	  bridge_native_rtp. (YAY!) * When one side hangs up,
	  bridge_native_rtp is told to stop bridging. It then re-evaluates
	  the channels and asks them how they are bridged - and since T.38
	  is enabled, they reply with a Local bridge (which is correct),
	  but is wrong because the audio portion is still technically in a
	  remote bridge. * Asterisk releases the surviving channel, whose
	  audio is *not* re-INVITED back to Asterisk as bridge_native_rtp
	  incorrectly assumes that it was in a local bridge. Ironically,
	  prior to r425242, this used to work mostly due to a fluke in the
	  bridging layer. The purpose of the get_rtp_info callback
	  shouldn't be modified: it should tell the bridging layer what
	  kind of bridge the channel prefers at that moment in time. If you
	  have T.38 enabled, that *must* be a local bridge, as the UDPTPL
	  stack must be in the media path. As such, this patch does not
	  modify that part of the code. However, we have to tell the
	  channels to re-evaluate themselves when they come out of a native
	  bridge, since we can no longer trust the get_rtp_info callbacks
	  when the native bridge is being stopped. Something else may have
	  changed in the channels, and they may now be lying to us. As
	  such, this patch makes it so that we unilaterally tell the
	  channels that they are no longer bridged via the update_peer
	  callback. This is actually what the channels expect anyway: code
	  in both chan_sip and chan_pjsip's callbacks look at the T.38
	  state and - if they were in T.38 - send a re-INVITE to get the
	  audio back to Asterisk. Review:

	  Escaped semicolons are then unescaped and become part of the

	  true comments are stripped on read, any semicolons in
	  ast_variable.value must have been escaped originally. This patch
	  re-escapes semicolons in ast_variable.values before they're

	  r426594 was made, it did not take into account a unit test that
	  verified that the function properly populated the unsupported
	  buffer. The function would previously memset the buffer if it
	  detected it had any contents; since this function can now be
	  called iteratively on successive headers, the unit tests would
	  now fail. This patch updates the unit tests to reset the buffer
	  themselves between successive calls, and updates the
	  documentation of the function to note that this is now required.

	  to them without mapping. This also allows us to remove the

	* res/res_xmpp.c, main/tcptls.c, /: AST-2014-011: Fix POODLE
	  security issues There are two aspects to the vulnerability: (1)
	  res_jabber/res_xmpp use SSLv3 only. This patch updates the module
	  to use TLSv1+. At this time, it does not refactor
	  res_jabber/res_xmpp to use the TCP/TLS core, which should be done
	  as an improvement at a latter date. (2) The TCP/TLS core, when
	  tlsclientmethod/sslclientmethod is left unspecified, will default
	  to the OpenSSL SSLv23_method. This method allows for all
	  encryption methods, including SSLv2/SSLv3. A MITM can exploit
	  this by forcing a fallback to SSLv3, which leaves the server
	  vulnerable to POODLE. This patch adds WARNINGS if a user uses
	  SSLv2/SSLv3 in their configuration, and explicitly disables
	  SSLv2/SSLv3 if using SSLv23_method. For TLS clients, Asterisk
	  will default to TLSv1+ and WARN if SSLv2 or SSLv3 is explicitly
	  chosen. For TLS servers, Asterisk will no longer support SSLv2 or
	  SSLv3. Much thanks to abelbeck for reporting the vulnerability
	  and providing a patch for the res_jabber/res_xmpp modules.

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Revert 425922
	  This patch for r425922 introduced a bug, wherein sending an
	  INVITE request with no SDP would cause Asterisk to not send an
	  SDP Offer in the 200 OK. The current structure of
	  res_pjsip_sdp_rtp is a bit hard to deal with to fix this, as
	  create_outgoing_sdp has no knowledge of whether or not it is
	  creating an SDP as a new Offer or an Answer. This is something of
	  an oversight in the callback definition, as the caller of it does
	  have this information.

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Remove left over
	  reference to override_prefs The usage of the local override_prefs
	  variable in create_outgoing_sdp_stream was previously to track an
	  override format preference set by PJSIP_MEDIA_OFFER. Now,
	  however, that function simply sets the joint capabilities
	  structure, session->req_caps. During the media format rework, the
	  override_prefs was instead used to check if there were any
	  formats in session->req_caps. However, this usage isn't useful in
	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream. session->req_caps contains the
	  negotiated formats for *all* streams, not just the current one
	  being created. Thus, so long as any stream of any type has
	  provided a format, override_prefs will be non-zero. Hence, its
	  usage in checking whether or not we should look at the formats on
	  the endpoint or the joint capabilities is generally useless.
	  There's only two things useful to check: (1) Does the endpoint
	  have a format for the media type? (2) Did we negotiate a format
	  for the media type? If either of those is a 'no', then we must
	  kill the media stream.

	  Be more tolerant of offers When an inbound SDP offer is received,
	  Asterisk currently makes a few incorrection assumptions: (1) If
	  the offer contains more than a single audio/video stream,
	  Asterisk will reject the entire stream with a 488. This is an
	  overly strict response; generally, Asterisk should accept the
	  media streams that it can accept and decline the others. (2) If
	  the offer contains a declined media stream, Asterisk will attempt
	  to process it anyway. This can result in attempting to match
	  format capabilities on a declined media stream, leading to a 488.
	  Asterisk should simply ignore declined media streams. (3)
	  Asterisk will currently attempt to handle offers with AVPF with
	  use_avpf=No/AVP with use_avpf=Yes. This mismatch results in
	  invalid SDP answers being sent in response. If there is a
	  mismatch between the media type being offered and the
	  configuration, Asterisk must reject the offer with a 488. This
	  patch does the following: * Asterisk will accept SDP offers with
	  at least one media stream that it can use. Some WARNING messages
	  have been dropped to NOTICEs as a result. * Asterisk will not
	  accept an offer with a media type that doesn't match its

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: channels/chan_sip: Respect outboundproxy
	  setting when sending qualify requests The outboundproxy setting
	  is currently ignored when sending OPTIONS requests as a result of
	  the qualify setting. This means that if an Asterisk server is
	  unable to send the packet directly to a peer, it is unable to
	  qualify any non-inbound registered peer (e.g. a peer SIP Trunk).
	  This patch grabs the outboundproxy information for a peer when a
	  qualify attempt is being constructed and, if it finds the
	  information, uses it when sending the OPTIONS request. Review:

	* /, bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c: bridge_native_rtp: Fix audio
	  issues when moving from remote bridge to softmix When a native
	  RTP bridge that is remotely bridging its participants switches to
	  a softmix bridge, it may not properly re-INVITE the media for one
	  or both participants back to Asterisk. This is due to the current
	  bridge_native_rtp code only re-INVITEs if it believes the channel
	  will survive the bridge operation. Currently, that code is
	  failing, as it expects the channels to have a soft hangup flag
	  set on it indicating that a redirect has occurred or that the
	  channel is going to leave the bridge. (The code did not take into
	  account a smart bridge operation). This patch also renames a few

	* /, main/stasis_channels.c: stasis_channels.c: Resolve unfinished
	  Dials when doing masquerades (Part 2) Masquerades into and out of
	  channels that are involved in a dial operation don't create the
	  expected dial end event. The missing dial end event goes against
	  the model for things like CDRs and generating Dial end manager
	  actions and such. There are four cases: 1) A channel masquerades
	  into the caller channel. The case happens when performing a
	  blonde transfer using the channel driver's protocol. 2) A channel
	  masquerades into a callee channel. The case happens when
	  performing a directed call pickup. 3) The caller channel
	  masquerades out of dial. The case happens when using the Bridge
	  application on the caller channel. 4) A callee channel
	  masquerades out of dial. The case happens when using the Bridge
	  application on a peer channel. As it turned out, all four cases
	  need to be handled instead of just the first one. ASTERISK-24237

	  non-unique category names via AMI This patch provides the
	  capability to manipulate templates and categories with non-unique
	  names via AMI. Summary of changes: GetConfig and GetConfigJSON:
	  Added "Filter" parameter: A comma separated list of
	  name_regex=value_regex expressions which will cause only
	  categories whose variables match all expressions to be
	  considered. The special variable name TEMPLATES can be used to
	  control whether templates are included. Passing 'include' as the
	  value will include templates along with normal categories.
	  Passing 'restrict' as the value will restrict the operation to
	  ONLY templates. Not specifying a TEMPLATES expression results in
	  the current default behavior which is to not include templates.
	  UpdateConfig: NewCat now includes options for allowing duplicate
	  category names, indicating if the category should be created as a
	  template, and specifying templates the category should inherit
	  from. The rest of the actions now accept a filter string as
	  defined above. If there are non-unique category names, you can
	  now update specific ones based on variable values. To facilitate
	  the new capabilities in manager, corresponding changes had to be
	  made to config, most notably the addition of filter criteria to
	  many of the APIs. In some cases it was easy to change the
	  references to use the new prototype but others would have
	  required touching too many files for this patch so a wrapper with
	  the original prototype was created. Macros couldn't be used in
	  this case because it would break binary compatibility with
	  modules such as res_digium_phone that are linked to real symbols.

	  Performing a directed call pickup resulted in a deadlock when
	  PJSIP channels were involved. A masquerade needs to hold onto the
	  channel locks while it swaps channel information between the two
	  channels involved in the masquerade. With PJSIP channels, the
	  fixup routine needed to push a fixup task onto the PJSIP
	  channel's serializer. Unfortunately, if the serializer was also
	  processing a task that needed to lock the channel, you get
	  deadlock. * Added a new control frame that is used to notify the
	  channels that a masquerade is about to start and when it has
	  completed. * Added the ability to query taskprocessors if the
	  current thread is the taskprocessor thread. * Added the ability
	  to suspend/unsuspend the PJSIP serializer thread so a masquerade
	  could fixup the PJSIP channel without using the serializer.

	* tests/test_cel.c, tests/test_cdr.c: Make CDR and CEL unit tests
	  less FRACKy. Prior to this commit, CDR and CEL tests were
	  expected to trigger FRACKs (i.e. assertions) due to the fact that
	  the channels they create have no formats on them. Some code was
	  independently added recently that attempts to prevent FRACKs from
	  occurring by failing early when attempting to set up translation
	  paths if one or both channels support no formats. Unfortunately,
	  this attempt to be helpful made the CDR and CEL tests go from
	  simply FRACKing to outright failing and in some cases, failing so
	  badly as to crash Asterisk. This commit seeks to correct past
	  mistakes by adding the ulaw format to channels created by the CDR
	  and CEL unit tests. This makes setting up translation paths
	  succeed, eliminates previously-seen FRACKs, and ultimately causes
	  the unit tests to succeed again. Review:

	* main/channel.c: main/channel: Unlock channel in off-nominal path
	  In r423414 (13) / r423415 (trunk), an API call that determines if
	  a format capability structure is empty was added. This returns
	  true if the format capability structure is completely empty or
	  "none". A check for this was added in channel.c's set_format
	  call. Unfortunately, when this check was true, it returned from
	  the function while still holding the channel lock. This caused
	  the CDR unit tests - which have a tendency to create channels
	  with no formats - to deadlock. Whoops. This patch unlocks the

	* /, main/app.c: Remove undocumented default behavior of
	  ast_play_and_record_full acceptdtmf. ast_play_and_record_full()
	  has a parameter called "acceptdtmf" that is a string of
	  acceptable DTMF digits that may be pressed by a caller to end and
	  accept the recording. ARI uses this function in order to perform
	  recording, and it provides options for what is passed as
	  acceptdtmf to ast_play_and_record_full(). By default, ARI passes
	  an empty string, with the intention that no DTMF can be used to
	  end the recording. The problem is that ast_play_and_record_full()
	  attempts to be "helpful" by setting "#" as the acceptdtmf if an
	  empty string or NULL pointer has been passed in. With ARI, this
	  results in unexpected behavior occurring if you have attempted to
	  intercept "#" yourself in order to perform some other
	  manipulation of the live recording. This change removes the
	  "helpful" behavior by no longer accepting "#" as a default
	  acceptdtmf if none is specified by the caller of
	  ast_play_and_record_full(). This makes the ARI scenario work as
	  expected. The other callers of ast_play_and_record_full() are
	  app_voicemail and app_minivm, and in both cases, they pass an
	  explicit "#" to ast_play_and_record_full() as acceptdtmf, so they
	  are unaffected by this change. ........ Merged revisions 422964

	  apps/app_stack.c: main/cdrs: Preserve context/extension when
	  executing a Macro or GoSub The context/extension in a CDR is
	  generally considered the destination of a call. When looking at a
	  2-party call CDR, users will typically be presented with the
	  following: context exten channel dest_channel app data default
	  1000 SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 However, if the Dial
	  actually takes place in a Macro, the current behaviour in 12 will
	  result in the following CDR: context exten channel dest_channel
	  app data macro-dial s SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 The
	  same is true of a GoSub: context exten channel dest_channel app
	  data subs dial_stuff SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 This
	  generally makes the context/exten fields less than useful. It
	  isn't hard to preserve these values in the CDR state machine;
	  however, we need to have something that informs us when a channel
	  is executing a subroutine. Prior to this patch, there isn't
	  anything that does this. This patch solves this problem by adding
	  a new channel flag, AST_FLAG_SUBROUTINE_EXEC. This flag is set on
	  a channel when it executes a Macro or a GoSub. The CDR engine
	  looks for this value when updating a Party A snapshot; if the
	  flag is present, we don't override the context/exten on the main
	  CDR object. In a funny quirk, executing a hangup handler must
	  *not* abide by this logic, as the endbeforehexten logic assumes
	  that the user wants to see data that occurs in hangup logic,
	  which includes those subroutines. Since those execute outside of
	  a typical Dial operation (and will typically have their own
	  dedicated CDR anyway), this is unlikely to cause any heartburn.

	* main/cdr.c, /: main/cdr: Fix crash/memory consumption in CDRs in
	  multi-party bridge scenarios This patch fixes an issue where CDRs
	  would get stuck generating an infinite number of CDRs, eventually
	  crashing Asterisk (and consuming a lot of memory along the way).
	  When a channel enters into a multi-party bridge, the CDR engine
	  creates mappings of each participant to each other participant,
	  picking the 'A' party as it goes. So, if we have four channels in
	  a multi-party bridge (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Denise), we would have
	  something like: Alice => Bob Alice => Charlie Alice => Denise Bob
	  => Charlie Bob => Denise Charlie => Denise This works fine when
	  participants enter the bridge a single time. When a participant
	  leaves a bridge, the CDRs for that channel are transitioned to a
	  finalized state. The bug occurs if Bob rejoins. When the CDR
	  engine creates mappings between the channels, it walks through
	  all the participants currently in the bridge, and realizes that
	  no one in the bridge can create a CDR with the channel (Bob). As
	  such it creates a new CDR for the candidate and appends it to
	  that candidate's chain. Unfortunately, on this particular code
	  path, it doesn't stop traversing the candidate's chain. Since we
	  just added ourselves to the chain, this causes the loop to keep
	  going, constantly adding new CDRs. This patch makes it so the
	  engine bails when it creates a CDR match in this case. Review:

	* funcs/func_channel.c: func_channel.c: Add missing locking to some
	  CHANNEL() requests. * The CHANNEL() audionativeformat,
	  videonativeformat, audioreadformat, and audiowriteformat now need
	  locking since the media format rework when accessing the
	  channel's format pointers. * Increased the buffer size for
	  CHANNEL() audionativeformat and videonativeformat output strings
	  since the allow=all can be a lengthy list. * Tweaked the
	  CHANNEL() XML documentation for secure_bridge_signaling,
	  secure_bridge_media, and state. * Ensured the output buffer is
	  initialized for secure_bridge_signaling and secure_bridge_media.
	  * Made use the locked_copy_string() macro instead of inlining it
	  for trace and checkhangup.

	* /, channels/chan_pjsip.c, res/res_pjsip_diversion.c,
	  res/res_pjsip_session.c, include/asterisk/res_pjsip_session.h:
	  Resolve race condition where channels enter dialplan application
	  before media has been negotiated. Testsuite tests will
	  occasionally fail because on reception of a 200 OK SIP response,
	  an AST_CONTROL_ANSWER frame is queued prior to when media has
	  finished being negotiated. This is because session supplements
	  are called into before PJSIP's inv_session code has told us that
	  media has been updated. Sometimes the queued answer frame is
	  handled by the PBX thread before the ensuing media negotiations
	  occur, causing a test failure. As it turns out, there is another
	  place that session supplements could be called into, which is
	  after media has finished getting negotiated. What this commit
	  introduces is a means for session supplements to indicate when
	  they wish to be called into when handling an incoming SIP
	  response. By default, all session supplements will be run at the
	  same point that they were prior to this commit. However, session
	  supplements may indicate that they wish to be handled earlier
	  than normal on redirects, or they may indicate they wish to be
	  handled after media has been negotiated. In this changeset, two
	  session supplements have been updated to indicate a preference
	  for when they should be run: res_pjsip_diversion executes before
	  handling redirection in order to get information from the
	  Diversion header, and chan_pjsip now handles responses to INVITEs
	  after media negotiation to fix the race condition mentioned
	  previously. ASTERISK-24212 #close Reported by Matt Jordan Review:

	* res/res_stasis.c, /, res/stasis/stasis_bridge.c: res_stasis:
	  Don't play MoH to channels by default when added to holding
	  bridges When ARI manipulates a bridge, it generally doesn't care
	  what the mixing technology is. Operations on a bridge initiated
	  through ARI should perform their action in generally the same
	  way, regardless of the bridge's mixing technology. While the
	  mixing technology may determine how media flows to channels, the
	  actual operations on a bridge themselves should be the same.
	  Currently, this isn't the case with holding bridges. When a
	  channel joins without a role, MoH is started on that channel
	  automatically. Subsequent bridge operations that would stop MoH
	  would fail (as there is no Announcer channel playing MoH to the
	  bridge). Starting MoH on the bridge will also create two MoH
	  streams: one from the MoH being played on the participant
	  channel, and one from the announcer channel. From the perspective
	  of ARI users, this is counter-intuitive - I would not expect MoH
	  to be started for me. The mixing technology determines how media
	  is shared between participants, not the application experience.
	  This patch does the following: * The Stasis bridge class now
	  inspects channels as they are going into a bridge. If the bridge
	  has a holding capability, and the channel has no roles, we give
	  it a participant role and mark the default behaviour to have no
	  entertainment. This allows addChannel operations to continue to
	  set a participant role with an entertainment option if it felt
	  like it (or could do it). * The music on hold channel is now

	  allow for linking to UniMRCP The UniMRCP project distributes
	  Asterisk modules that integrate Asterisk with UniMRCP, and other
	  Asterisk users use the UniMRCP library as well. Unfortunately,
	  the UniMRCP license is Apache 2.0, which per the Free Software
	  Foundation, is not a compatible license with the GPLv2. "Please
	  note that this license is not compatible with GPL version 2,
	  because it has some requirements that are not in that GPL
	  version. These include certain patent termination and
	  indemnification provisions. The patent termination provision is a
	  good thing, which is why we recommend the Apache 2.0 license for
	  substantial programs over other lax permissive licenses." On the
	  other hand, UniMRCP is a great project and we'd like to let
	  people use it with Asterisk. This patch updates the LICENSE text
	  to allow users to link Asterisk with UniMRCP and distribute the
	  resulting binaries. ........ Merged revisions 422293 from

	* /, channels/chan_iax2.c: chan_iax2: Fix Dynamic IAX2
	  Registrations After Temporary DNS Failure The reporter on the
	  issue found some issues when upgrading from version 10 to 11 on
	  55 hosts. Two situations that can occur with dynamic
	  registrations. 1. With dnsmgr disabled, if the host is not
	  resolvable we are not trying to resolve the host again when it is
	  time to attempt to register again. This results in never
	  registering to the host. 2. With dnsmgr enabled, when the host is
	  temporarily not resolvable the address is set to 0.0.0.0:0 and
	  then when the host is resolvable the port is not being restored
	  and stays set to 0. This patch resolves these two issues by: *
	  Storing the hostname so that it can be used for resolving with
	  DNS. * Resolve the hostname on the next scheduled attempt to
	  register. * Storing the port used to reach the host so that when
	  the hostname is resolvable again, we can set the port again if
	  the port is still unset after looking up the host. ASTERISK-23767

	* main/sched.c, /: Fix race condition in the scheduler when

	  someone attempts to delete a scheduled task at the time that it
	  is running, leading to a crash. This change corrects the issue by
	  tracking which task is currently running. If that task is
	  attempted to be deleted, then we mark the task, and then wait for
	  the task to complete. This way, we can be sure to coordinate task

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Don't use port derived from
	  fromdomain if it isn't set If a user does not provide a port in
	  the fromdomain setting, chan_sip will set the fromdomainport to
	  STANDARD_SIP_PORT (5060). The fromdomainport value will then get
	  used unilaterally in certain places. This causes issues with TLS,

	  not the standard SIP port; otherwise, the port from the SIP pvt's

	* /, UPGRADE.txt, main/app.c: ARI: Fix implicit answer when
	  playback is initiated on unanswered channel When issuing a POST
	  /channels/{channel_id}/play on a channel that is not yet
	  answered, ARI is supposed to: * Queue up an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS
	  on the channel * Start up the playback of the media Instead, we
	  sneak an answer on the channel right before starting playing
	  media. This is due to ARI's usage of control_streamfile. This
	  function implicitly answers the channel (and doesn't give ARI the
	  option to stop it). The answering of the channel here is probably
	  unnecessary: * app_voicemail, by far the biggest consumer of this
	  function, always answers the channels anyway * control stream
	  file (in res_agi) and ControlPlayback probably shouldn't be
	  implicitly answering the channel. Answering should not be tied
	  directly to playing back media. As it turns out, the answering of
	  the channel here is pretty old: 356042 twilson if
	  (ast_channel_state(chan) != AST_STATE_UP) { 3087 anthm res =

	  If a manager or CLI user attached a mixmonitor to a call running
	  a dynamic bridge feature while in a bridge, the feature would be
	  interrupted and the channel would be forcibly kicked out of the
	  bridge (usually ending the call during a simple 1 to 1 call).
	  This would also occur during any similar action that could set
	  the unbridge soft hangup flag, so the fix for this was to remove
	  unbridge from the soft hangup flags and make it a separate thing

	  issues: 1) The order of Dial events have been changed when
	  performing a call forward. The order has now been altered to 1)
	  Dial begins dialing channel A. 2) When A forwards the call to B,
	  we issue the dial end event to channel A, indicating the dial is
	  being canceled due to a forward to B. 3) When the call to channel
	  B occurs, we then issue a new dial begin to channel B. 2) Call
	  forwards are now reported on the calling channel, not the peer
	  channel. 3) AMI DialEnd events have been altered to display the
	  extension the call is being forwarded to when relevant. 4) You
	  can now get the values of channel variables for channels that are
	  not currently in the Stasis application. This brings the
	  retrieval of channel variables more in line with the rest of
	  channel read operations since they may be performed on channels

	* res/res_pjsip_pubsub.c: Fix crashing unit tests with regards to

	  up to store resource lists in memory rather than retrieving from
	  configuration. With a setup that is not conducive to running the
	  tests, a fault in sorcery currently causes Asterisk to crash when
	  attempting to run any of the tests. To get around the crash, this
	  adds a function that verifies the current environment and marks
	  the tests as "not run" if the setup is not correct.

	* res/res_pjsip_pubsub.c: Fix crash encountered by the testsuite.
	  Running testsuite tests locally produced no errors, but when run
	  using the continuous integration framework, crashes occurred. The
	  crashes occurred due to a refcounting error that had been fixed

	  (added), configs/samples/queuerules.conf.sample: app_queue: Add
	  RealTime support for queue rules This patch gives the optional
	  ability to keep queue rules in RealTime. It is important to note
	  that with this patch: (a) Queue rules in RealTime are only
	  examined on module load/reload (b) Queue rules are loaded both
	  from the queuerules.conf file as well as the RealTime backend To
	  inform app_queue to examine RealTime for queue rules, a new
	  setting has been added to queuerules.conf's general section
	  "realtime_rules". RealTime queue rules will only be used when
	  this setting is set to "yes". The schema for the database table
	  supports a rule_name, time, min_penalty, and max_penalty columns.
	  min_penalty and max_penalty can be relative, if a '-' or '+'
	  literal is provided. Otherwise, the penalties are treated as
	  constants. For example: rule_name, time, min_penalty, max_penalty
	  'default', '10', '20', '30' 'test2', '20', '30', '55' 'test2',
	  '25', '-11', '+1111' 'test2', '400', '112', '333' 'test3', '0',
	  '4564', '46546' 'test_rule', '40', '15', '50' which would result
	  in : Rule: default - After 10 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY

	  seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 55 and adjust

	  Rule: test_rule - After 40 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to
	  50 and adjust QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 15 If you use RealTime, the
	  queue rules will be always reloaded on a module reload, even if
	  the underlying file did not change. With the option disabled, the
	  rules will only be reloaded if the file was modified. Review:

	* main/pbx.c: pbx: Filter out pattern matching hints in responses
	  sent to ExtensionStateList Hints that are a pattern match are
	  technically stored in the hint container in the same fashion as
	  concrete implementations of hints. The pattern matching hints,
	  however, are not "real" in the sense that things can subscribe to
	  them: rather, they are stored in the hints container so that when
	  a subscription is made a "real" hint can be generated for the
	  subscription if one does not yet exist. The extension state core
	  takes care of this correctly by matching against non-pattern
	  matching extensions prior to pattern matching extensions. Because
	  of this, however, the ExtensionStateList AMI action was returning
	  pattern matching hints when executed. These hints are meaningless
	  from the perspective of AMI clients: their state will never
	  change, they cannot be subscribed to, and events would never
	  normally be generated from them. As such, we now filter these out
	  of the response.

	* build_tools/post_process_documentation.py: build_tools: Skip
	  managerEvent combining for AMI action responses AMI action
	  responses can (and will) reference AMI events that they return.
	  These event references and definitions should not be combined
	  with AMI events raised elsewhere in the code, as they are
	  specifically tied to the AMI action that raised them.

	* /, pbx/pbx_lua.c, main/pbx.c: pbx_lua: fix regression with global
	  sym export and context clash by pbx_config. ASTERISK-23818 (lua
	  contexts being overwritten by contexts of the same name in
	  pbx_config) surfaced because pbx_lua, having the
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS set, was always force loaded before
	  pbx_config. Since I couldn't find any reason for pbx_lua to
	  export it's symbols to the rest of Asterisk, I simply changed the
	  flag to AST_MODFLAG_DEFAULT. Problem solved. What I didn't
	  realize was that the symbols need to be exported not because
	  Asterisk needs them but because any external Lua modules like
	  luasql.mysql need the base Lua language APIs exported
	  (ASTERISK-17279). Back to ASTERISK-23818... It looks like there's
	  an issue in pbx.c where context_merge was only merging includes,
	  switches and ignore patterns if the context was already existing
	  AND has extensions, or if the context was brand new. If pbx_lua
	  is loaded before pbx_config, the context will exist BUT pbx_lua,
	  being implemented as a switch, will never place extensions in it,
	  just the switch statement. The result is that when pbx_config
	  loads, it never merges the switch statement created by pbx_lua
	  into the final context. This patch sets pbx_lua's modflag back to
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS and adds an "else if" in context_merge
	  that catches the case where an existing context has includes,
	  switchs or ingore patterns but no actual extensions.

	  ARI: Add channel technology agnostic out of call text messaging
	  This patch adds the ability to send and receive text messages
	  from various technology stacks in Asterisk through ARI. This
	  includes chan_sip (sip), res_pjsip_messaging (pjsip), and
	  res_xmpp (xmpp). Messages are sent using the endpoints resource,
	  and can be sent directly through that resource, or to a
	  particular endpoint. For example, the following would send the
	  message "Hello there" to PJSIP endpoint alice with a display URI
	  of sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org:
	  ari/endpoints/sendMessage?to=pjsip:alice&from=sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org&body=Hello+There
	  This is equivalent to the following as well:
	  ari/endpoints/PJSIP/alice/sendMessage?from=sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org&body=Hello+There
	  Both forms are available for message technologies that allow for
	  arbitrary destinations, such as chan_sip. Inbound messages can
	  now be received over ARI as well. An ARI application that
	  subscribes to endpoints will receive messages from those
	  endpoints: { "type": "TextMessageReceived", "timestamp":
	  "2014-07-12T22:53:13.494-0500", "endpoint": { "technology":
	  "PJSIP", "resource": "alice", "state": "online", "channel_ids":
	  [] }, "message": { "from": "\"alice\" <sip:alice@127.0.0.1>",
	  "to": "pjsip:asterisk@127.0.0.1", "body": "Watson, come here.",
	  "variables": [] }, "application": "testsuite" } The above was
	  made possible due to some rather major changes in the message
	  core. This includes (but is not limited to): - Users of the
	  message API can now register message handlers. A handler has two
	  callbacks: one to determine if the handler has a destination for
	  the message, and another to handle it. - All dialplan
	  functionality of handling a message was moved into a message
	  handler provided by the message API. - Messages can now have the
	  technology/endpoint associated with them. Various other
	  properties are also now more easily accessible. - A number of ao2
	  containers that weren't really needed were replaced with vectors.
	  Iteration over ao2_containers is expensive and pointless when the
	  lifetime of things is well defined and the number of things is
	  very small. res_stasis now has a new file that makes up its
	  structure, messaging. The messaging functionality implements a
	  message handler, and passes received messages that match an
	  interested endpoint over to the app for processing. Note that
	  inadvertently while testing this, I reproduced ASTERISK-23969.
	  res_pjsip_messaging was incorrectly parsing out the 'to' field,
	  such that arbitrary SIP URIs mangled the endpoint lookup. This
	  patch includes the fix for that as well. Review:

	  module that sends RTCP information to a Homer Server This patch
	  adds a new module to Asterisk, res_hep_rtcp. The module
	  subscribes to the RTCP topics in Stasis and receives RTCP
	  information back from the message bus. It encodes into HEPv3
	  packets and sends the information to the res_hep module for
	  transmission. Using this, someone with a Homer server can get
	  live call quality monitoring for all RTP-based channels in their
	  Asterisk 12+ systems. In addition, there were a few bugs in the
	  RTP engine, res_rtp_asterisk, and chan_pjsip that were uncovered
	  by the tests written for the Asterisk Test Suite. This patch
	  fixes the following: 1) chan_pjsip failed to set its channel
	  unique ids on its RTP instance on outbound calls. It now does
	  this in the appropriate location, in the serialized call
	  callback. 2) The rtp_engine was overflowing some values when
	  packed into JSON. Specifically, some longs and unsigned ints
	  can't be be packed into integer values, for obvious reasons.
	  Since libjansson only supports integers, floats, strings,
	  booleans, and objects, we print these values into strings. 3)
	  res_rtp_asterisk had a few problems: (a) it would emit a source
	  IP address of 0.0.0.0 if bound to that IP address. We now use
	  ast_find_ourip to get a better IP address, and properly marshal
	  the result into an ast_strdupa'd string. (b) Reports can be
	  generated with no report bodies. In particular, this occurs when
	  a sender is transmitting information to a receiver (who will send
	  no RTP back to the sender). As such, the sender has no report
	  body for what it received. We now properly handle this case, and
	  the sender will emit SR reports with no body. Likewise, if we
	  receive an RTCP packet with no report body, we will still
	  generate the appropriate events. ASTERISK-24119 #close ........

	  the recording was made. - silence_duration: optional. The
	  duration of silence that was detected while the recording was
	  made. These values are reported in the RecordingFinished ARI
	  event. When a DSP is enabled on the channel during the recording
	  - which occurs when the recording is created with

	* main/loader.c, res/res_calendar.c: module loader: Unload modules
	  in reverse order of their start order When Asterisk starts a
	  module (calling its load_module function), it re-orders the
	  module list, sorting it alphabetically. Ostensibly, this was done
	  so that the output of 'module show' listed modules in alphabetic
	  order. This had the unfortunate side effect of making modules
	  with complex usage patterns unloadable. A module that has a large
	  number of modules that depend on it is typically abandoned during
	  the unloading process. This results in its memory not being
	  reclaimed during exit. Generally, this isn't harmful - when the
	  process is destroyed, the operating system will reclaim all
	  memory allocated by the process. Prior to Asterisk 12, we also
	  didn't have many modules with complex dependencies. However, with
	  the advent of ARI and PJSIP, this can make make unloading those
	  modules successfully nearly impossible, and thus tracking memory
	  leaks or ref debug leaks a real pain. While this patch is not a
	  complete overhaul of the module loader - such an effort would be
	  beyond the scope of what could be done for Asterisk 13 - this
	  does make some marginal improvements to the loader such that
	  modules like res_pjsip or res_stasis *may* be made properly
	  un-loadable in the future. 1. The linked list of modules has been
	  replaced with a doubly linked list. This allows traversal of the
	  module list to occur backwards. The module shutdown routine now
	  walks the global list backwards when it attempts to unload
	  modules. 2. The alphabetic reorganization of the module list on
	  startup has been removed. Instead, a started module is placed at
	  the end of the module list. 3. The ast_update_module_list
	  function - which is used by the CLI to display the modules - now
	  does the sorting alphabetically itself. It creates its own linked
	  list and inserts the modules into it in alphabetic order. This
	  allows for the intent of the previous code to be maintained. This
	  patch also contains a fix for res_calendar. Without
	  calendar.conf, the calendar modules were improperly bumping the
	  use count of res_calendar, then failing to load themselves. This
	  patch makes it so that we detect whether or not calendaring is
	  enabled before altering the use count. Review:

	* apps/app_bridgewait.c, /: app_bridgewait: Remove possibility of
	  race condition between channels leaving/joining. Bridges created
	  by app_bridgewait previously had the "dissolve when empty" flag
	  set. This caused the bridge core to destroy them when the last
	  channel had left. This introduced a race condition where we may
	  have a reference to the bridge but it is not actually joinable
	  when we try to join it. This flag has now been removed and the
	  bridge is guaranteed to be joinable at all times. ASTERISK-23987

	  main/channel.c, main/dial.c, main/pbx.c: accountcode: Slightly
	  change accountcode propagation. The previous behavior was to
	  simply set the accountcode of an outgoing channel to the
	  accountcode of the channel initiating the call. It was done this
	  way a long time ago to allow the accountcode set on the SIP/100
	  channel to be propagated to a local channel so the dialplan
	  execution on the Local;2 channel would have the SIP/100
	  accountcode available. SIP/100 -> Local;1/Local;2 -> SIP/200
	  Propagating the SIP/100 accountcode to the local channels is very
	  useful. Without any dialplan manipulation, all channels in this
	  call would have the same accountcode. Using dialplan, you can set
	  a different accountcode on the SIP/200 channel either by setting
	  the accountcode on the Local;2 channel or by the Dial
	  application's b(pre-dial), M(macro) or U(gosub) options, or by
	  the FollowMe application's b(pre-dial) option, or by the Queue
	  application's macro or gosub options. Before Asterisk v12, the
	  altered accountcode on SIP/200 will remain until the local
	  channels optimize out and the accountcode would change to the
	  SIP/100 accountcode. Asterisk v1.8 attempted to add peeraccount
	  support but ultimately had to punt on the support. The
	  peeraccount support was rendered useless because of how the CDR
	  code needed to unconditionally force the caller's accountcode
	  onto the peer channel's accountcode. The CEL events were thus
	  intentionally made to always use the channel's accountcode as the
	  peeraccount value. With the arrival of Asterisk v12, the
	  situation has improved somewhat so peeraccount support can be
	  made to work. Using the indicated example, the the accountcode
	  values become as follows when the peeraccount is set on SIP/100
	  before calling SIP/200: SIP/100 ---> Local;1 ---- Local;2 --->
	  SIP/200 acct: 100 \/ acct: 200 \/ acct: 100 \/ acct: 200 peer:
	  200 /\ peer: 100 /\ peer: 200 /\ peer: 100 If a channel already
	  has an accountcode it can only change by the following explicit
	  user actions: 1) A channel originate method that can specify an
	  accountcode to use. 2) The calling channel propagating its
	  non-empty peeraccount or its non-empty accountcode if the
	  peeraccount was empty to the outgoing channel's accountcode
	  before initiating the dial. e.g., Dial and FollowMe. The
	  exception to this propagation method is Queue. Queue will only
	  propagate peeraccounts this way only if the outgoing channel does
	  not have an accountcode. 3) Dialplan using CHANNEL(accountcode).
	  4) Dialplan using CHANNEL(peeraccount) on the other end of a
	  local channel pair. If a channel does not have an accountcode it
	  can get one from the following places: 1) The channel driver's
	  configuration at channel creation. 2) Explicit user action as
	  already indicated. 3) Entering a basic or stasis-mixing bridge
	  from a peer channel's peeraccount value. You can specify the
	  accountcode for an outgoing channel by setting the
	  CHANNEL(peeraccount) before using the Dial, FollowMe, and Queue
	  applications. Queue adds the wrinkle that it will not overwrite
	  an existing accountcode on the outgoing channel with the calling
	  channels values. Accountcode and peeraccount values propagate to
	  an outgoing channel before dialing. Accountcodes also propagate
	  when channels enter or leave a basic or stasis-mixing bridge. The
	  peeraccount value only makes sense for mixing bridges with two
	  channels; it is meaningless otherwise. * Made peeraccount
	  functional by changing accountcode propagation as described
	  above. * Fixed CEL extracting the wrong ie value for the
	  peeraccount. This was done intentionally in Asterisk v1.8 when
	  that version had to punt on peeraccount. * Fixed a few places
	  dealing with accountcodes that were reading from channels without
	  the lock held. AFS-65 #close Review:

	* main/devicestate.c, channels/chan_pjsip.c: device state: Update
	  the core to report ONHOLD if a channel is on hold In Asterisk, it
	  is possible for a device to have a status of ONHOLD. This is not
	  typically an easy thing to determine, as a channel being on hold
	  is not a direct channel state. Typically, this has to be
	  calculated outside of the core independently in channel drivers,
	  notably, chan_sip and chan_pjsip. Both of these channel drivers
	  already have to calculate device state in a fashion more complex
	  than the core can handle, as they aggregate all state of all
	  channels associated with a peer/endpoint; they also independently
	  track whether or not one of those channels is currently on hold
	  and mark the device state appropriately. In 12+, we now have the
	  ability to report an AST_DEVICE_ONHOLD state for all channels
	  that defer their device state to the core. This is due to channel
	  hold state actually now being tracked on the channel itself. If a
	  channel driver defers its device state to the core (which many,
	  such as DAHDI, IAX2, and others do in most situations), the
	  device state core already goes out to get a channel associated
	  with the device. As such, it can now also factor the channel hold
	  state in its calculation. This patch adds this logic to the
	  device state core. It also uses an existing mapping between
	  device state and channel state to handle more channel states.
	  chan_pjsip has been updated slightly as well to make use of this
	  (as it was, for some reason, reporting a channel state of BUSY as
	  a device state of INUSE, which feels slightly wrong). Review:

	* main/endpoints.c, tests/test_stasis_endpoints.c, /: endpoints:
	  Fix failing unit tests from r419196 This patch does two things:
	  (1) It updates the unit tests to expect additional stasis
	  messages. More messages are now sent to the endpoint topic, due
	  to forwarding all channel messages and the forwarding
	  relationship set up between endpoints themselves. (2) Remove the
	  technology forwarding subscription during ast_endpoint_shutdown.
	  This prevents an improper double shutdown of an endpoint from
	  occurring. ........ Merged revisions 419318 from

	  endpoint/channel subscription issues; allow for subscriptions to
	  tech This patch serves two purposes: (1) It fixes some bugs with
	  endpoint subscriptions not reporting all of the channel events
	  (2) It serves as the preliminary work needed for ASTERISK-23692,
	  which allows for sending/receiving arbitrary out of call text
	  messages through ARI in a technology agnostic fashion. The
	  messaging functionality described on ASTERISK-23692 requires two
	  things: (1) The ability to send/receive messages associated with
	  an endpoint. This is relatively straight forwards with the
	  endpoint core in Asterisk now. (2) The ability to send/receive
	  messages associated with a technology and an arbitrary technology
	  defined URI. This is less straight forward, as endpoints are
	  formed from a tech + resource pair. We don't have a mechanism to
	  note that a technology that *may* have endpoints exists. This
	  patch provides such a mechanism, and fixes a few bugs along the
	  way. The first major bug this patch fixes is the forwarding of
	  channel messages to their respective endpoints. Prior to this
	  patch, there were two problems: (1) Channel caching messages
	  weren't forwarded. Thus, the endpoints missed most of the
	  interesting bits (such as channel creation, destruction, state
	  changes, etc.) (2) Channels weren't associated with their
	  endpoint until after creation. This resulted in endpoints missing
	  the channel creation message, which limited the usefulness of the
	  subscription in the first place (a major use case being 'tell me
	  when this endpoint has a channel'). Unfortunately, this meant
	  another parameter to ast_channel_alloc. Since not all channel
	  technologies support an ast_endpoint, this patch makes such a
	  call optional and opts for a new function,
	  ast_channel_alloc_with_endpoint. When endpoints are created, they
	  will implicitly create a technology endpoint for their technology
	  (if one does not already exist). A technology endpoint is special
	  in that it has no state, cannot have channels created for it,
	  cannot be created explicitly, and cannot be destroyed except on
	  shutdown. It does, however, have all messages from other
	  endpoints in its technology forwarded to it. Combined with the
	  bug fixes, we now have Stasis messages being properly forwarded.
	  Consider the following scenario: two PJSIP endpoints (foo and
	  bar), where bar has a single channel associated with it and foo
	  has two channels associated with it. The messages would be
	  forwarded as follows: channel PJSIP/foo-1 -- \ --> endpoint
	  PJSIP/foo -- / \ channel PJSIP/foo-2 -- \ ---- > endpoint PJSIP /
	  channel PJSIP/bar-1 -----> endpoint PJSIP/bar -- ARI, through the
	  applications resource, can: - subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP/foo and
	  get notifications for channels PJSIP/foo-1,PJSIP/foo-2 and
	  endpoint PJSIP/foo - subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP/bar and get
	  notifications for channels PJSIP/bar-1 and endpoint PJSIP/bar -
	  subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP and get notifications for channels
	  PJSIP/foo-1,PJSIP/foo-2,PJSIP/bar-1 and endpoints
	  PJSIP/foo,PJSIP/bar Note that since endpoint PJSIP never changes,
	  it never has events itself. It merely provides an aggregation
	  point for all other endpoints in its technology (which in turn
	  aggregate all channel messages associated with that endpoint).
	  This patch also adds endpoints to res_xmpp and chan_motif,
	  because the actual messaging work will need it (messaging without
	  XMPP is just sad). Review:

	  handling of media for performance improvements In the old times
	  media formats were represented using a bit field. This was fast
	  but had a few limitations. 1. Asterisk was limited in how many
	  formats it could handle. 2. Formats, being a bit field, could not
	  include any attribute information. A format was strictly its
	  type, e.g., "this is ulaw". This was changed in Asterisk 10 (see
	  https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Media+Architecture+Proposal
	  for notes on that work) which led to the creation of the
	  ast_format structure. This structure allowed Asterisk to handle
	  attributes and bundle information with a format. Additionally,
	  ast_format_cap was created to act as a container for multiple
	  formats that, together, formed the capability of some entity.
	  Another mechanism was added to allow logic to be registered which
	  performed format attribute negotiation. Everywhere throughout the
	  codebase Asterisk was changed to use this strategy.
	  Unfortunately, in software, there is no free lunch. These new
	  capabilities came at a cost. Performance analysis and profiling
	  showed that we spend an inordinate amount of time comparing,
	  copying, and generally manipulating formats and their related
	  structures. Basic prototyping has shown that a reasonably large
	  performance improvement could be made in this area. This patch is
	  the result of that project, which overhauled the media format
	  architecture and its usage in Asterisk to improve performance.
	  Generally, the new philosophy for handling formats is as follows:
	  * The ast_format structure is reference counted. This removed a
	  large amount of the memory allocations and copying that was done
	  in prior versions. * In order to prevent race conditions while
	  keeping things performant, the ast_format structure is immutable
	  by convention and lock-free. Violate this tenet at your peril! *
	  Because formats are reference counted, codecs are also reference
	  counted. The Asterisk core generally provides built-in codecs and
	  caches the ast_format structures created to represent them.
	  Generally, to prevent inordinate amounts of module reference
	  bumping, codecs and formats can be added at run-time but cannot
	  be removed. * All compatibility with the bit field representation
	  of codecs/formats has been moved to a compatibility API. The
	  primary user of this representation is chan_iax2, which must
	  continue to maintain its bit-field usage of formats for
	  interoperability concerns. * When a format is negotiated with
	  attributes, or when a format cannot be represented by one of the
	  cached formats, a new format object is created or cloned from an
	  existing format. That format may have the same codec underlying
	  it, but is a different format than a version of the format with
	  different attributes or without attributes. * While formats are
	  reference counted objects, the reference count maintained on the
	  format should be manipulated with care. Formats are generally
	  cached and will persist for the lifetime of Asterisk and do not
	  explicitly need to have their lifetime modified. An exception to
	  this is when the user of a format does not know where the format
	  came from *and* the user may outlive the provider of the format.
	  This occurs, for example, when a format is read from a channel:
	  the channel may have a format with attributes (hence, non-cached)
	  and the user of the format may last longer than the channel (if
	  the reference to the channel is released prior to the format's
	  reference). For more information on this work, see the API design
	  notes:
	  https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Media+Format+Rewrite
	  Finally, this work was the culmination of a large number of
	  developer's efforts. Extra thanks goes to Corey Farrell, who took
	  on a large amount of the work in the Asterisk core, chan_sip, and
	  was an invaluable resource in peer reviews throughout this
	  project. There were a substantial number of patches contributed
	  during this work; the following issues/patch names simply reflect
	  some of the work (and will cause the release scripts to give
	  attribution to the individuals who work on them). Reviews:

	  /ari/recordings/stored/{recordingName}/copy?destinationRecordingName={copy_name}
	  This is particularly useful for voicemail-esque applications,

	* channels/chan_sip.c, UPGRADE.txt: chan_sip: Make
	  progressinband=never really mean 'never' progressinband=never in
	  sip.conf is easily defeated if an onward trunk sends a progress
	  indication of its own. This is almost certain to happen if the
	  onward trunk is ISDN or IAX as these technologies send a progress
	  indication even if early media is not required. This progress
	  message is passed to the caller, and causes the "never" option to
	  be rather badly named. This patch changes the behaviour of this
	  setting in the following ways: 1) In sip_write(), do not pass the
	  media unless we have either progressed beyond INV_EARLY_MEDIA, or
	  we are in INV_EARLY_MEDIA state, and early media is both set-up
	  and wanted. This helps resolve double-ringing on some buggy
	  handsets. 2) In sip_indicate(), if we see AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS,
	  but SIP_PROG_INBAND_NEVER is set, send a 180 Ringing instead to
	  avoid implicitly enabling early media. Avoid sending double ring
	  indications. NOTE: the meaning of the SIP_PROGRESS_SENT flag
	  changes slightly in this patch to also encapsulate the fact that
	  a channel has *sent or received* a 183 Progress indication. This
	  makes the updated code in sip_write() much more simple. Review:

	  The removal of external repositories eases a future migration to
	  git (2) Asterisk is now the only thing that uses menuselect; as a
	  result, there's little need to keep it in an external repository
	  Subsequent patches will remove the mxml dependency from

	  res/res_stasis.c, /, res/stasis/app.c: ARI/res_stasis: Subscribe
	  to both Local channel halves when originating to app This patch
	  fixes two bugs: 1. When originating a channel into a Stasis
	  application, we already create a subscription for the channel
	  that is going into our Stasis app. Unfortunately, when you create
	  a Local channel and pass it off to a Stasis app, you really
	  aren't creating just one channel: you're creating two. This patch
	  snags the second half of the Local channel pair (assuming it is a
	  Local channel pair, but luckily core_local is kind about such
	  assumptions) and subscribes to it as well. 2. Subscriptions are a
	  bit sticky right now. If a subscription is made, the 'interest'
	  count gets bumped on the Stasis subscription - but unless
	  something explicitly unsubscribes the channel, said subscription
	  sticks around. This is not much of a problem is a user is
	  creating the subscription - if they made it, they must want it.
	  However, when we are creating implicit subscriptions, we need to
	  make sure something clears them out. This patch takes a
	  pessimistic approach: it watches the cache updates coming from
	  Stasis and, if we notice that the cache just cleared out an
	  object, we delete our subscription object. This keeps our ao2
	  container of Stasis forwards in an application from growing out
	  of hand; it also is a bit more forgiving for end users who may
	  not realize they were supposed to unsubscribe from that channel
	  that just hung up. Review:

	  res/res_pjsip_session.c, /: CEL: Fix incorrect/missing extra
	  field information This corrects two issues with the extra field
	  information in Asterisk 12+ in channel event logs. It is possible
	  to inject custom values into the dialstatus provided by
	  ast_channel_dial_type() Stasis messages that fall outside the
	  enumeration allowed for the DIALSTATUS channel variable. CEL now
	  filters for the allowed values and ignores other values. The
	  "hangupsource" extra field key is always blank if the far end
	  channel is a chan_pjsip channel. This is because the hangupsource
	  is never set for the pjsip channel driver. This change sets the
	  hangupsource whenever a hangup is queued for chan_pjsip channels.
	  This corrects an issue with the pjsip channel driver where the
	  hangupcause information was not being set properly. Review:

	* main/Makefile: main/Makefile: fix compilation error of buildinfo
	  occurring on 'make install' Egads. Another bad deletion of too
	  much when attempting to remove h323 stuff.

	* configure.ac, build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure,
	  main/Makefile: configure: Remove last vestiges of h323; DO create
	  menuselect-deps The previous patch (r418034) fixed the 'glitch'
	  that the channels/h323 Makefile no longer existed. Unfortunately,
	  removing the entire line was a bit of a blunder, as it meant that
	  build_tools/menuselect-deps was never generated. Hilarity ensued
	  when actually trying to compile. But hey! At least configure
	  worked. This patch fixes *that* glitch, and removes some more of
	  the vestiges of h323. (It had tendrils in the main Makefile?
	  Crazy.)

	* configure.ac, configure: configure: Update script to pass if
	  channels/h323/Makefile.in does not exist This simply removes that
	  check from the configure script, as r418019 removed chan_h323.

	  Billing records are fair, To get paid is quite bright, You should
	  really use ODBC; Good-bye cdr_sqlite. Microsoft did once push
	  H.323, Hell, we all remember NetMeeting. But try to compile
	  chan_h323 now And you will take quite a beating. The XMPP and SIP
	  war was fierce, And in the distant fray Was birthed
	  res_jabber/chan_jingle; But neither to stay. For everyone did
	  care and chase what Google professed. "Free Internet Calling" was
	  what devotees cried, But Google did change the specs so often
	  That the developers were happy the day chan_gtalk died. And then
	  there was that odd application Dedicated to the Polish tongue.
	  app_saycountpl was subsumed by Say; One could say its bell was
	  rung. To read and parse a file from the dialplan You could (I
	  guess) use an application. app_readfile did fill that purpose,
	  but I think A function is perhaps better in its creation. Barging
	  is rude, I'm not sure why we do it. Inwardly, the caller will
	  probably sigh. But if you really must do it, Don't use
	  app_dahdibarge, use ChanSpy. We all despise the sound of tinny
	  robots It makes our queues so cold. To control such an
	  abomination It's better to not use Wait/SetMusicOnHold. It's
	  often nice to know properties of a channel It makes our calls
	  right We have a nice function called CHANNEL And so SIPCHANINFO
	  is sent off into the night. And now things get odd; Apparently
	  one could delimit with a colon Properties from the SIPPEER
	  function! Commas are in; all others are done. Finally, a word on
	  pipes and commas. We're sorry. We can't say it enough. But those
	  compatibility options in asterisk.conf; To maintain them forever
	  was just too tough. This patch removes: * cdr_sqlite * chan_gtalk
	  * chan_jingle * chan_h323 * res_jabber * app_saycountpl *
	  app_readfile * app_dahdibarge It removes the following
	  applications/functions: * WaitMusicOnHold * SetMusicOnHold *
	  SIPCHANINFO It removes the colon delimiter from the SIPPEER
	  function. Finally, it also removes all compatibility options that
	  were configurable from asterisk.conf, as these all applied to
	  compatibility with Asterisk 1.4 systems. Review:

	  configs/chan_dahdi.conf.sample, /, UPGRADE.txt,
	  channels/sig_pri.c: chan_dahdi: Add inband_on_setup_ack
	  compatibility option. The new inband_on_setup_ack option causes
	  Asterisk to assume inband audio may be present when a
	  SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message is received. Q.931 Section 5.1.3 says
	  that in scenarios with overlap dialing, when a dialtone is sent
	  from the network side, progress indicator 8 "Inband info now
	  available" MAY be sent to the CPE if no digits were received with
	  the SETUP. It is thus implied that the ie is mandatory if digits
	  came with the SETUP and dialtone is needed. This option should be
	  enabled, when the network sends dialtone and you want to hear it,
	  but the network doesn't send the progress indicator when needed.
	  NOTE: For Q.SIG setups this option should be enabled when
	  outgoing overlap dialing is also enabled because Q.SIG does not
	  send the progress indicator with the SETUP ACK. The commit
	  -r413714 (AST-1338) which causes this issue was dealing with a

	* main/tcptls.c, CHANGES: main/tcptls: Add support for Perfect
	  Forward Secrecy This patch enables Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
	  in Asterisk's core TLS API. Modules that wish to enable PFS
	  should consider the following: - Ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE) is
	  enabled by default. To disable it, do not specify a ECDHE cipher
	  suite in a module's configuration, for example:
	  tlscipher=AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA - Ephemeral DH (DHE) is
	  disabled by default. To enable it, add DH parameters into the
	  private key file, i.e., tlsprivatekey. For an example, see the
	  default dh2048.pem at
	  http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/OpenSSL098/OpenSSL098-35.1/src/apps/dh2048.pem?txt
	  - Because clients expect the server to prefer PFS, and because
	  OpenSSL sorts its cipher suites by bit strength, (see "openssl
	  ciphers -v DEFAULT") consider re-ordering your cipher suites in
	  the conf file. For example:
	  tlscipher=AES128+kEECDH:AES128+kEDH:3DES+kEDH:AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:-ADH:-AECDH
	  will use PFS when offered by the client. Clients which do not
	  offer PFS fall-back to AES-128 (or even 3DES as recommend by RFC
	  3261). Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3647/

	* CHANGES, apps/app_jack.c: app_jack: Support audio with a sampling
	  rate higher than 8kHz This patch enables the jack-audiohook to
	  cope with dynamic sampling rates from and to Asterisk.
	  Information from the channel is taken to derive the channel's
	  sampling rate, suiting SLINxx format and frame->datalen. There
	  are stil a few limitations after this patch: * Required
	  information is taken from the channel during initialization as
	  the audiohook does not provide this information.
	  Audiohook.internal_sampl_rate(...) is set later, but no callback
	  is available to inform app_jack. * Frame.datalen is computed
	  using "rate / 50" assuming a ptime of 20ms. There is no internal
	  API available to determine datalen for a SLINxx. * Ringbuffer
	  size is now dynamic depending on the value of frame.datalen (see
	  above) and the number of frames, which are in
	  RINGBUFFER_FRAME_CAPACITY, that need to fit. Review:
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3618 Note that the patch being
	  committed here is based on the patch posted on ASTERISK-23836.

	  websocket correctly and use careful fwrite When a client takes a
	  long time to process information received from Asterisk, a write
	  operation using fwrite may fail to write all information. This
	  causes the underlying file stream to be in an unknown state, such
	  that the socket must be disconnected. Unfortunately, there are
	  two problems with this in Asterisk's existing websocket code: 1.
	  Periodically, during the read loop, Asterisk must write to the
	  connected websocket to respond to pings. As such, Asterisk
	  maintains a reference to the session during the loop. When
	  ast_http_websocket_write fails, it may cause the session to
	  decrement its ref count, but this in and of itself does not break
	  the read loop. The read loop's write, on the other hand, does not
	  break the loop if it fails. This causes the socket to get in a
	  'stuck' state, preventing the client from reconnecting to the
	  server. 2. More importantly, however, is that the fwrite in
	  ast_http_websocket_write fails with a large volume of data when
	  the client takes awhile to process the information. When it does
	  fail, it fails writing only a portion of the bytes. With some
	  debugging, it was shown that this was failing in a similar
	  fashion to ASTERISK-12767. Switching this over to
	  ast_careful_fwrite with a long enough timeout solved the problem.
	  Note that this version of the patch, unlike r417310 in Asterisk
	  11, exposes configuration options beyond just chan_sip's
	  sip.conf. Configuration options to configure the write timeout
	  have also been added to pjsip.conf and ari.conf. #ASTERISK-23917

	* channels/sig_pri.c, channels/sig_pri.h, channels/chan_dahdi.c:
	  suspended destructions of pri spans on events If a DAHDI span
	  disappears, we wish for its representation in Asterisk to be
	  destroyed as well. The information about the span's removal may
	  come from several paths: 1. DAHDI sends DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVE on
	  every channel. 2. An extra DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVED is sent on every
	  subsequent call to DAHDI_GET_EVENT. 3. Every read (including the
	  internal one by libpri on the D-channel) returns -ENODEV.
	  Asterisk responsds to DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVE on a channel by
	  destroying it. Destroying a channel requires holding the channel
	  list lock (iflock). Destroying a channel that is part of a span
	  requires holding the span's lock. Destroying a channel from a
	  context that holds the span lock, while at the same time another
	  channel is destroyed directly, leads to a deadlock. Solution:
	  don't destroy span while holding the channels list lock. Thus
	  changes in this patch: * Deferring removal of PRI spans in
	  response to events: doomed spans are collected on a list. *
	  Doomed spans are removed periodically by the monitor thread. *
	  ENODEV reads from the D-channel will warant the same deferred
	  removal. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3548/

	* /, main/stasis_channels.c: stasis_channels: Update the stasis
	  cache if manager variables are needed In r416211, the publishing
	  of variable changes was modified such that a cached channel
	  snapshot was used if manager variables were not requested with
	  each AMI event. This was done to reduce the amount of channel
	  snapshots created. However, an assumption was made that
	  generating a channel snapshot and publishing the snapshot to the
	  channel topic was sufficient to ensure that the cache would be
	  updated; this is not the case. The channel snapshot type must be
	  used to force a snapshot update. This patch updates the
	  publication of channel variables such that the cache is updated
	  prior to publication of the channel variable message if manager
	  variables are in use. This ensures that all AMI events receive
	  the variable update when they are supposed to. Note that this
	  issue was caught by the Asterisk Test Suite (go go testing)

	* res/res_musiconhold.c, /: MoH: Don't restart stream on repeated
	  start calls Currently, music on hold will stop and then start
	  again from the beginning if ast_moh_start() is called multiple
	  times. This can happen if a call is put on hold repeatedly (the
	  channel receives multiple HOLD control frames) and can be
	  triggered from ARI by starting MoH on a channel multiple times.
	  This is fairly jarring/annoying to users. This change prevents
	  MoH from being restarted if the requested music class is the same
	  as the one currently playing. This includes an extra check to
	  prevent the errors previously experienced in the testsuite and
	  has 100+ test runs behind it. Review:

	  channel snapshots to improve performance During some performance
	  testing of Asterisk with AGI, ARI, and lots of Local channels, we
	  noticed that there's quite a hit in performance during channel
	  creation and releasing to the dialplan (ARI continue). After
	  investigating the performance spike that occurs during channel
	  creation, we discovered that we create a lot of channel snapshots
	  that are technically unnecessary. This includes creating
	  snapshots during: * AGI execution * Returning objects for ARI
	  commands * During some Local channel operations * During some
	  dialling operations * During variable setting * During some
	  bridging operations And more. This patch does the following: - It
	  removes a number of fields from channel snapshots. These fields
	  were rarely used, were expensive to have on the snapshot, and
	  hurt performance. This included formats, translation paths, Log
	  Call ID, callgroup, pickup group, and all channel variables. As a
	  result, AMI Status, "core show channel", "core show channelvar",
	  and "pjsip show channel" were modified to either hit the live
	  channel or not show certain pieces of data. While this is
	  unfortunate, the performance gain from this patch is worth the
	  loss in behaviour. - It adds a mechanism to publish a cached
	  snapshot + blob. A large number of publications were changed to
	  use this, including: - During Dial begin - During Variable
	  assignment (if no AMI variables are emitted - if AMI variables
	  are set, we have to make snapshots when a variable is changed) -
	  During channel pickup - When a channel is put on hold/unhold -
	  When a DTMF digit is begun/ended - When creating a bridge
	  snapshot - When an AOC event is raised - During Local channel
	  optimization/Local bridging - When endpoint snapshots are
	  generated - All AGI events - All ARI responses that return a
	  channel - Events in the AgentPool, MeetMe, and some in Queue -
	  Additionally, some extraneous channel snapshots were being made
	  that were unnecessary. These were removed. - The result of
	  ast_hashtab_hash_string is now cached in stasis_cache. This
	  reduces a large number of calls to ast_hashtab_hash_string, which
	  reduced the amount of time spent in this function in gprof by
	  around 50%. #ASTERISK-23811 #close Reported by: Matt Jordan

	  connection and never sending anything to the configured HTTP port
	  in http.conf will tie up a HTTP connection. Since there is a
	  maximum number of open HTTP sessions allowed at a time you can
	  block legitimate connections. A similar problem exists if a HTTP
	  request is started but never finished. * Added http.conf
	  session_inactivity timer option to close HTTP connections that
	  aren't doing anything. Defaults to 30000 ms. * Removed the
	  undocumented manager.conf block-sockets option. It interferes
	  with TCP/TLS inactivity timeouts. * AMI and SIP TLS connections
	  now have better authentication timeout protection. Though I
	  didn't remove the bizzare TLS timeout polling code from chan_sip.
	  * chan_sip can now handle SSL certificate renegotiations in the
	  middle of a session. It couldn't do that before because the
	  socket was non-blocking and the SSL calls were not restarted as
	  documented by the OpenSSL documentation. * Fixed an off nominal
	  leak of the ssl struct in handle_tcptls_connection() if the FILE
	  stream failed to open and the SSL certificate negotiations
	  failed. The patch creates a custom FILE stream handler to give
	  the created FILE streams inactivity timeout and timeout after a
	  specific moment in time capability. This approach eliminates the
	  need for code using the FILE stream to be redesigned to deal with
	  the timeouts. This patch indirectly fixes most of ASTERISK-18345
	  by fixing the usage of the SSL_read/SSL_write operations.

	  res_pjsip. SIP transaction timeouts are handled in the PJSIP
	  monitor thread. When this happens on a subscription, and the

	  dispatched synchronously to the threadpool. The issue is that the
	  PJSIP dialog is locked by the monitor thread, and then the
	  dispatched task attempts to lock the dialog. This leads to a
	  deadlock that causes SIP traffic to no longer be accepted on the
	  Asterisk server. The fix here is to treat the monitor thread as
	  if it were a threadpool thread when it attempts to dispatch
	  synchronous tasks. This way, the dispatched task turns into a
	  simple function call within the same thread, and the locking
	  issue is averted. AST-2014-008 ASTERISK-23802 #close ........

	* res/res_pjsip_header_funcs.c, /: chan_pjsip: Fix bug where custom
	  SIP headers could be duplicated on outgoing INVITEs. When using
	  PJSIP_HEADER() to add custom headers to outgoing INVITE requests,
	  certain situations could result in the headers being duplicated.
	  For instance, if the request were retransmitted, or if the INVITE
	  were re-sent with authentication credentials, the custom headers
	  would be re-added to the request. The fix here is to, after
	  adding the custom headers to the outbound INVITE, remove the
	  datastore that holds the custom headers to add. This way, there
	  is no risk in accidentally adding them if the session supplement
	  is called into a second or third time. ........ Merged revisions

	* main/config.c, /: config: Fix config files not reloading when
	  only an included file changes. The twisted logic determining if a
	  config file should be reloaded was mostly broken and disabled.
	  The incorrect test that ASTERISK-23383 fixed actually reenabled
	  the broken logic. The incorrect test was causing the timestamp to
	  always be cleared which caused config files with includes to
	  always be reloaded. * Made wildcard includes always cause a
	  reload. Determining if a file was deleted cannot be determined
	  without restructuring the cache to determine if any files are
	  missing from the last files actually loaded. Also without
	  refactoring config_text_file_load(), the glob loop couldn't check
	  more than one file for changes anyway. * Made remove the cache
	  entry if the file no longer exists when trying to get its
	  timestamp or it is no longer a regular file. This fixes the
	  corner case where the file was loaded, then deleted, then the
	  config reloaded, then the file restored with the same timestamp,
	  and then the config reloaded again. * Made remove the cache entry
	  include list when actually loading the file. This gets rid of any

	  implemented and there is limited http response code handling
	  (basically, it is connect or not). Also added an initial new URI

	  reduce chatty verbose messages This patch addresses some
	  aesthetic issues in Asterisk. These are all just minor tweaks to
	  improve the look of the CLI when used in a variety of settings.
	  Specifically: * A number of chatty verbose messages were removed
	  or demoted to DEBUG messages. Verbose messages with a verbosity
	  level of 5 or higher were - if kept as verbose messages - demoted
	  to level 4. Several messages that were emitted at verbose level 3
	  were demoted to 4, as announcement of dialplan applications being
	  executed occur at level 3 (and so the effects of those
	  applications should generally be less). * Some verbose messages
	  that only appear when their respective 'debug' options are
	  enabled were bumped up to always be displayed. *
	  Prefix/timestamping of verbose messages were moved to the
	  verboser handlers. This was done to prevent duplication of
	  prefixes when the timestamp option (-T) is used with the CLI. *
	  Verbose magic is removed from messages before being emitted to
	  non-verboser handlers. This prevents the magic in multi-line
	  verbose messages (such as SIP debug traces or the output of
	  DumpChan) from being written to files. * _Slightly_ better
	  support for the "light background" option (-W) was added. This
	  includes using ast_term_quit in the output of XML documentation
	  help, as well as changing the "Asterisk Ready" prompt to bright
	  green on the default background (which stands a better chance of
	  being displayed properly than bright white). Review:

	* /, main/core_unreal.c: core_unreal: Prevent double free of
	  core_unreal pvt When a channel is destroyed (such as via

	  problematic for a few reasons: 1. The channel tech pvt is an ao2

	  The channel tech pvt's reference count is dropped just prior to
	  calling ast_channel_release, resulting in the pvt's destruction.
	  Hence, the channel destructor is free'ing an invalid pointer.
	  This patch keeps the dropping of the reference count, but sets
	  the pvt to NULL on the channel prior to releasing it. This models

	  res_corosync: Update module to work with Stasis (and compile)
	  This patch fixes res_corosync such that it works with Asterisk
	  12. This restores the functionality that was present in previous
	  versions of Asterisk, and ensures compatibility with those
	  versions by restoring the binary message format needed to pass
	  information from/to them. The following changes were made in the
	  core to support this: * The event system has been partially
	  restored. All event definition and event types in this patch were
	  pulled from Asterisk 11. Previously, we had hoped that this
	  information would live in res_corosync; however, the approach in
	  this patch seems to be better for a few reasons: (1)
	  Theoretically, ast_events can be used by any module as a binary
	  representation of a Stasis message. Given the structure of an
	  ast_event object, that information has to live in the core to be
	  used universally. For example, defining the payload of a device
	  state ast_event in res_corosync could result in an incompatible
	  device state representation in another module. (2) Much of this
	  representation already lived in the core, and was not easily
	  extensible. (3) The code already existed. :-) * Stasis message
	  types now have a message formatter that converts their payload to
	  an ast_event object. * Stasis message forwarders now handle
	  forwarding to themselves. Previously this would result in an
	  infinite recursive call. Now, this simply creates a new
	  forwarding object with no forwards set up (as it is the thing it
	  is forwarding to). This is advantageous for res_corosync, as
	  returning NULL would also imply an unrecoverable error. Returning
	  a subscription in this case allows for easier handling of message
	  types that are published directly to an aggregate topic that has
	  forwarders. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3486/

	  issues were caught by the (currently failing)
	  pjsip/transfers/blind_transfer/caller_direct_media test. The test
	  currently fails primarily for two reasons: (1) When Bob and
	  Charlie (the transfer target and the transfer destination) enter
	  a bridge together, the framehook remains on the transfer target
	  channel until both channels are in the bridge. As it consumes
	  voice frames, the initial bridge type is a simple bridge. The
	  framehook is removed when both channels are in the bridge;
	  however, this does not currently cause the bridging framework to
	  re-evaluate the bridge. This patch adds a AST_SOFTHANGUP_UNBRIDGE
	  poke to the transfer target channel when a framehook is removed
	  so the bridge can re-evaluate itself. (2) When a channel leaves a
	  native RTP bridge, it may be leaving due to being hung up.
	  Sending a re-INVITE to a channel that is about to be hung up is
	  not nice - in fact, there's a good chance we'll send the BYE
	  request before the channel has had a chance to send back a 200
	  OK. To be somewhat nicer, this patch adds a function to channel.h
	  that allows the bridging framework to query for exactly why a
	  channel is leaving a bridge via the channel's soft hangup flags.
	  This allows it to only send the re-INVITE if there's a chance the
	  channel will survive the native bridging experience. Review:

	* configure.ac, channels/sig_pri.c, /, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in: chan_dahdi/sig_pri: Prevent
	  unnecessary PROGRESS events when overlap dialing is enabled. When
	  overlap dialing is enabled, the lack of inband audio available
	  information in the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE events causes an
	  interoperability problem with SIP. sig_pri doesn't know if there
	  is dialtone present when a SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE is received so it
	  assumes it is there and posts an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame. The
	  SIP channel driver then sends out a 183 Session Progress and
	  blocks the desired 180 Ringing message when the ALERTING message
	  comes in. * Made the configure script detect if the installed
	  version of libpri supports the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE enhancements. *
	  Using the new API, made generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame on
	  an incoming SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message when the message indicates
	  inband audio is present instead of assuming that dialtone is
	  present. * Using the new API, made SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE send out an
	  inband audio available indication only if dialtone is expected.
	  The change also makes the fallback behaviour of sending the
	  PROGRESS message better by sending it only if dialtone is
	  expected. * Changed receiving a PROCEEDING message to not
	  generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame if the progress indication
	  ie indicates non-end-to-end-ISDN. This helps interoperability
	  with SIP. * Changed sending a PROCEEDING message in response to
	  an AST_CONTROL_PROCEEDING frame to not indicate inband audio
	  available. It was silly to do so anyway because the channel
	  driver doesn't know if inband audio is even available. This helps
	  interoperability with SIP. This patch and a corresponding change
	  in libpri work together to allow Asterisk to control the inband
	  audio available progress indication ie on the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE
	  message when dialtone is present. AST-1338 #close Reported by:

	  an Oid cast as an int, which during any nominal execution would
	  be cast to 0. Returning 0 when more than 0 rows were inserted
	  causes problems to the function's callers. To give an idea of how
	  strange code can be, this is the necessary code change to fix a
	  device state issue reported against chan_pjsip in Asterisk 12+.
	  The issue was that the registrar would attempt to insert contacts
	  into the database. Because of the 0 return from res_config_pgsql,
	  the registrar would think that the contact was not successfully
	  inserted, even though it actually was. As such, even though the
	  contact was query-able and it was possible to call the endpoint,
	  Asterisk would "think" the endpoint was unregistered, meaning it
	  would report the device state as UNAVAILABLE instead of
	  NOT_INUSE. The necessary fix applies to all versions of Asterisk,
	  so even though the bug reported only applies to Asterisk 12+, the
	  code correction is being inserted into 1.8+. Closes issue

	* include/asterisk/spinlock.h (added), /, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: This patch adds
	  support for spinlocks in Asterisk. There are cases in Asterisk
	  where it might be desirable to lock a short critical code section
	  but not incur the context switch and yield penalty of a mutex or
	  rwlock. The primary spinlock implementations execute exclusively
	  in userspace and therefore don't incur those penalties. Spinlocks
	  are NOT meant to be a general replacement for mutexes. They
	  should be used only for protecting short blocks of critical code
	  such as simple compares and assignments. Operations that may
	  block, hold a lock, or cause the thread to give up it's timeslice
	  should NEVER be attempted in a spinlock. The first use case for
	  spinlocks is in astobj2 - internal_ao2_ref. Currently the
	  manipulation of the reference counter is done with an
	  ast_atomic_fetchadd_int which works fine. When weak reference
	  containers are introduced however, there's an additional
	  comparison and assignment that'll need to be done while the lock
	  is held. A mutex would be way too expensive here, hence the
	  spinlock. Given that lock contention in this situation would be
	  infrequent, the overhead of the spinlock is only a few more
	  machine instructions than the current ast_atomic_fetchadd_int
	  call. ASTERISK-23553 #close Review:

	  and simply not send the PAI/RPID headers at all if set to 'no'.
	  By default trust_id_outbound will be set to 'legacy' which will
	  preserve the behavior prior to these patches. Extra special

	  caused issues). We now also no longer open/close the file on each
	  write, instead relying on fflush to make sure data gets written
	  to the file (in case the ao2 call being performed is about to
	  cause a crash) (3) It goes with a comma delineated format for the
	  ref debug file. This makes parsing much easier. This also now
	  includes the thread ID of the thread that caused ref change. (4)
	  A new python script instead for refcounting has been added in the
	  contrib/scripts folder. (5) The old refcounter implementation in

	* CHANGES, funcs/func_periodic_hook.c (added): func_periodic_hook:
	  New function for periodic hooks. This commit introduces a new
	  dialplan function, PERIODIC_HOOK(). It allows you run to a
	  dialplan hook on a channel periodically. The original use case
	  that inspired this was the ability to play a beep periodically
	  into a call being recorded. The implementation is much more
	  generic though and could be used for many other things. The
	  implementation makes heavy use of existing Asterisk components.
	  It uses a combination of Local channels and ChanSpy() to run some
	  custom dialplan and inject any audio it generates into an active
	  call. The other important bit of the implementation is how it
	  figures out when to trigger the beep playback. This
	  implementation uses the audiohook API, even though it's not
	  actually touching the audio in any way. It's a convenient way to
	  get a callback and check if it's time to kick off another beep.
	  It would be nice if this was timer event based instead of polling
	  based, but unfortunately I don't see a way to do it that won't
	  interfere with other things. Review:

	* include/asterisk/options.h, main/asterisk.c, main/channel.c, /,
	  channels/chan_sip.c, configs/asterisk.conf.sample, UPGRADE.txt,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h, utils/extconf.c: internal_timing:
	  Remove the option and always make it enabled if a timing module
	  is loaded. The masquerade supertest frequently fails because
	  either the local channel chain doesn't completely optimize out or
	  the DTMF handshake doesn't completely get accross. Local channel
	  optimization requires frames flowing to trigger when optimization
	  can happen. When optimization happens the media frame that
	  triggered the optimization is dropped. Sending DTMF requires
	  frames to flow in the other direction for timing purposes while
	  sending nothing. If internal timing is not enabled when MOH is
	  playing, Asterisk switches to received timing when an audio frame
	  is received. With optimization dropping media frames and MOH not
	  sending frames unless it receives frames, occasionaly there are
	  no more frames being passed and the test fails. * The asterisk
	  command line -I option and the asterisk.conf internal_timing
	  option are removed. Asterisk now always uses internal timing when
	  needed if any timing module is loaded. The issue ASTERISK-14861
	  did this quite awhile ago in v1.4 but effectively is broken if
	  other internal timing modules besides DAHDI are used. The
	  ast_read_generator_actions() now only does received timing if it
	  has no choice for frame generators like MOH, silence, and
	  playback streaming. * Cleaned up some code dealing with frame
	  generators in ast_deactivate_generator(),
	  generator_write_format_change(), ast_activate_generator(), and
	  ast_channel_stop_silence_generator(). * Removed

	* /, res/res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: PJSIP: Allow for
	  identify sections to be specified in sorcery.conf. "identify" is
	  a special type of configuration object in PJSIP because unlike
	  the other objects, it is not provided by the base res_pjsip
	  module. Instead, it is provided by the
	  res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip module. If using the default
	  sorcery wizard (config,criteria=type=identify) then things work
	  because the module that applies the default wizard is the correct
	  module. However, if attempting to use sorcery.conf to apply an
	  alternate wizard, it was not possible. If you attempted to
	  specify the identify object type in the res_pjsip section, then
	  the object could not be registered since the object was
	  undocumented for the res_pjsip module. There was no alternate
	  configuration section defined for it, so you were out of luck if
	  you wanted to override the default wizard. With this change, the
	  identify section will properly have a sorcery.conf-based wizard
	  applied when the identify definition is within the

	  ARI through the introduction of synchronous bridge actions.
	  Playing back a file to a channel in an ARI bridge would attempt
	  to wait until the playback concluded before returning. The method
	  used involved signaling the waiting thread in the ARI custom
	  playback function. The problem with this is that there were some
	  corner cases that were not accounted for: * If a bridge channel
	  could not be found, then we never would attempt the playback but
	  would still attempt to wait for the playback to complete. * If
	  the bridge playfile action failed to queue, we would still
	  attempt to wait for the playback to complete. * If the bridge
	  playfile action were queued but some circumstance caused the
	  playback not to occur (the bridge dies, the channel is removed
	  from the bridge), then we would never be notified. The solution
	  to this is to move the waiting logic into the bridge code. A new
	  bridge API function is added to queue a synchronous action on a
	  bridge. The waiting thread is notified when the queued frame has
	  been freed, either due to an error occurring or due to successful
	  playback. As a failsafe, the waiting thread has a 10 minute
	  timeout just in case there is a frame leak somewhere. Review:

	  something was being sent to an application - or why something was
	  not being sent to an application - was a bit tricky, as there was

	* res/res_pjsip_multihomed.c (added), /: res_pjsip_multihomed: Add

	  is actually sent that the destination is reliably known. This
	  means that the addresses placed within the message may not be of
	  the interface the message is being sent out on. This module
	  determines what interface a message is being sent on and updates
	  the message to contain the correct address if applicable. This
	  module was tested by myself in a virtualized environment with
	  multiple interfaces and also by Kinsey Moore in the following
	  configuration: Networks: * 10.24.16.0/21 ** hard phone ** default
	  gateway * 10.24.64.0/21 ** softphone with pjsip-based stack
	  Transport details: bind address: 0.0.0.0 protocol: UDP All
	  endpoints were tested with explicitly configured transports and
	  unconfigured transports. This was tested with inbound and
	  outbound calls, both of which were experiencing detrimental
	  effects from incorrect IP addresses in SIP messages. These
	  effects were only experienced by the soft phone on the 10.24.64.0
	  network since the messages to the hard phone on the 10.24.16.0
	  network had the correct IP address. (closes issue ASTERISK-23020)

	  allow device state to cache and aggregate the device states from
	  local and remote entities in a single operation. The cached
	  aggregate device state is available immediately after it is
	  posted to the stasis bus. This improves performance by
	  eliminating a cache dump and associated ao2 container traversals
	  to calculate the aggregate state. (closes issue ASTERISK-23204)

	  separate string and creation time components without breaking
	  linkedid propgation. This allowed the uniqueid to be specified by
	  the user interface - and those values are now carried through to
	  channel creation, adding the assignedids value to every function
	  in the chain including the channel drivers. For local channels,
	  the second channel can be specified or left to default to a ;2
	  suffix of first. In ARI, bridge, playback, and snoop objects can
	  also be created with a specified uniqueid. Along the way, the
	  args order to allocating channels was fixed in chan_mgcp and
	  chan_gtalk, and linkedid is no longer lost as masquerade occurs.

	* /, res/res_musiconhold.c: moh: fix a refcount error with realtime
	  MOH I observed a crash in res_musiconhold on an Asterisk 11
	  system using realtime MOH. Investigation of the backtrace showed
	  a corrupt mohclass, implying that it got destroyed before the
	  code expected it to. I went looking for reference counting errors
	  that could have caused this crash and this patch this result. It
	  contains 2 changes. 1) Remove a usless block of code that was
	  impossible to reach. There was even a comment indicating that it
	  was impossible to reach. The conditional includes
	  "!ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)" and it's
	  inside of an if block with the opposite check
	  "ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)". There's no
	  good reason to keep it around. 2) A similar block to #1 contained
	  a reference counting error. It stores state->class in the local
	  variable mohclass without increasing its reference count. The
	  reference count on mohclass is decremented at the end of the
	  function. This block of code probably very rarely runs, which
	  would help explain why this system was working fine for many
	  months before experiencing a crash. Review:

	  main/config.c, main/sorcery.c: sorcery: Create AST_SORCERY
	  dialplan function. This patch creates the AST_SORCERY dialplan
	  function which allows someone to retrieve any value from a
	  sorcery-based config file. It's similar to AST_CONFIG. The
	  creation of the function itself was fairly straightforward but it
	  required changes to the underlying sorcery infrastructure that
	  rippled into individual sorcery objects. The changes stemmed from
	  inconsistencies in how sorcery created ast_variable objectsets
	  from sorcery objects and the inconsistency in how individual
	  objects used that feature especially when it came to parameters
	  that can be specified multiple times like contact in aor and
	  match in identify. You can read more here...
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2014-February/065202.html
	  So, what this patch does, besides actually creating the
	  AST_SORCERY function, is the following... * Creates
	  ast_variable_list_append which is a helper to append one
	  ast_variable list to another. * Modifies the
	  ast_sorcery_object_field_register functions to accept the
	  already-defined sorcery_fields_handler callback. * Modifies
	  ast_sorcery_objectset_create to accept a parameter indicating
	  return type preference...a single ast_variable with all values
	  concatenated or an ast_variable list with multiple entries. Also
	  fixed a few bugs. * Modifies individual sorcery object
	  implementations to use the new function definition of the
	  ast_sorcery_object_field_register functions. * Modifies
	  location.c and res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c to implement
	  sorcery_fields_handler handlers so they return multiple
	  occurrences as an ast_variable_list. * Added a whole bunch of
	  tests to test_sorcery. (closes issue ASTERISK-22537) Review:

	* /, res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Apply
	  packetization rules on inbound SDP handling The setting
	  'use_ptime' is supposed to tell Asterisk to honour the ptime
	  attribute in an offer, preferring it to whatever packetization
	  preferences have been set internally. Currently, however,
	  something rather quirky will happen: (1) The SDP answer will be
	  constructed in create_outgoing_sdp_stream. This will use the
	  preferences from the endpoint, such that the 200 OK response will
	  add the packetization preferences from the endpoint, and not what
	  was offered. (2) When the 200 response is issued,
	  apply_negotiated_sdp_stream is called. This will call
	  apply_packetization, which will use the ptime attribute from the
	  offer internally. We end up telling the offerer to use the
	  internal ptime attribute, but we end up using the offered ptime
	  attribute. Hilarity ensues. This patch modifies the behaviour by
	  calling apply_packetization from negotiate_incoming_sdp_stream,
	  which is called prior to create_outgoing_sdp_stream. This causes
	  the format preferences on the session's media object to be set to
	  the inbound ptime value (if 'use_ptime' is enabled), such that
	  the construction of the answer gets the right value immediately.

	* /, main/asterisk.c: main: Initialize dialplan providing core

	  entries. This patch moves a number of core component
	  initializations before the module pre-load. This guarantees that
	  if someone does pre-load pbx_config - or other pbx modules - that
	  the Stasis caches for the various core components are created.

	* main/channel.c, /: channel.c: MOH is not working for transferee
	  after attended transfer Updated the code to check to see if MOH
	  is playing on the transferor and if so then start it on the
	  channel that replaces it during a masquerade. Example scenario of
	  the problem: Alice calls Bob and then Bob begins the attended
	  transfer process into a queue. Upon going on hold Alice hears
	  music and so does Bob once he is in the queue. Bob then transfers
	  Alice into the queue and then music for Alice stops even though
	  she should be hearing it since has now replaced Bob in the queue.
	  The problem that was occurring is that once the channel was
	  masqueraded the app (queues, confbridge, etc...) had no way of
	  knowing that the channel had just been swapped out thus it did
	  not start music for the present channel. Credit to Olle Johansson
	  for pointing me in the right direction on this issue. (closes

	* /, main/pbx.c: pbx: Handle a completely empty dialplan during a
	  context merge It is highly unlikely, but - at least in Asterisk
	  12 - theoretically possible to load Asterisk with no dialplan
	  whatsoever. If that occurs, and some other module (that is not a
	  pbx module) attempts to merge its contexts into the dialplan, the
	  existing merge routine will crash. This is because it is not
	  insane, and rightly believes that you provided some sort of
	  dialplan, somewhere. This patch will gracefully merge the
	  contexts in such a case. Note that this is highly unlikely to
	  occur in 1.8/11, as features will most likely provide some
	  dialplan via parking. However, in Asterisk 12, parking is now
	  provided by res_parking, and hence may create its dialplan later.

	* main/stasis_endpoints.c, /: ARI: correct upper/lower case URI
	  discrepancies URI's are supposed to be case sensitive and all

	* channels/chan_iax2.c, include/asterisk/frame.h,
	  configs/iax.conf.sample, /: chan_iax2: Block unnecessary control
	  frames to/from the wire. Establishing an IAX2 call between
	  Asterisk v1.4 and v1.8 (or later) results in an unexpected call
	  disconnect. The problem happens because newer values in the enum
	  ast_control_frame_type are not consistent between the branch
	  versions of Asterisk. For example: 1) v1.4 calls v1.8 (or later)
	  using IAX2 2) v1.8 answers and sends a connected line update
	  control frame. (on v1.8 AST_CONTROL_CONNECTED_LINE = 22) 3) v1.4
	  receives the control frame as an end-of-q (on v1.4
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q = 22) 4) v1.4 disconnects the call once the
	  receive queue becomes empty. Several things are done by this
	  patch to fix the problem and attempt to prevent it from happening
	  again in the future: * Added a warning at the definition of enum
	  ast_control_frame_type about how to add new control frame values.
	  * Made block sending and receiving control frames that have no
	  reason to go over the wire. * Extended the connectedline iax.conf
	  parameter to also include the redirecting information updates. *
	  Updated the connectedline iax.conf parameter documentation to
	  include a notice that the parameter must be "no" when the peer is

	  UPGRADE.txt, main/manager_channels.c: CDRs: fix a variety of dial
	  status problems, h/hangup handler creating CDRs This patch fixes
	  a number of small-ish problems that were noticed when witnessing
	  the records that the FreePBX dialplan produces: (1) Mid-call
	  events (as well as privacy options) have the ability to change
	  the overall state of the Dial operation after the called party
	  answers. This means that publishing the DialEnd event when the
	  called party is premature; we have to wait for the execution of
	  these subroutines to complete before we can signal the overall
	  status of the DialEnd. This patch moves that publication and adds
	  handlers for the mid-call events. (2) The AST_FLAG_OUTGOING
	  channel flag is cleared if an after bridge goto datastore is
	  detected. This flag was preventing CDRs from being recorded for
	  all outbound channels that had a 'continue' option enabled on
	  them by the Dial application. (3) The CDR engine now locks the
	  'Dial' application as being the CDR application if it detects
	  that the current CDR has entered that app. This is similar to the
	  logic that is done for Parking. In general, if we entered into
	  Dial, then we want that CDR to record the application as such -
	  this prevents pre-dial handlers, mid-call handlers, and other
	  shenaniganry from changing the application value. (4) The CDR
	  engine now checks for the AST_SOFTHANGUP_HANGUP_EXEC in more
	  places to determine if the channel is in hangup logic or dead. In
	  either case, we don't want to record changes in the channel. (5)
	  The default option for "endbeforehexten" has been changed to
	  "yes". In general, you don't want to see CDRs in the 'h' exten or
	  in hangup logic. Since the semantics of that option changed in
	  12, it made sense to update the default value as well. (6)
	  Finally, because we now have the ability to synchronize on the
	  messages published to the CDR topic, on shutdown the CDR engine
	  will now synchronize to the messages currently in flight. This
	  helps to ensure that all in-flight CDRs are written before
	  shutting down. (closes issue ASTERISK-23164) Reported by: Matt

	* apps/app_dial.c, /: app_dial: Allow macro/gosub pre-bridge
	  execution to occur on priorities The parsing for the destination
	  of the macro/gosub uses the '^' character to separate out
	  context, extension, and priority. However, the logic for the
	  macro/gosub execution was written such that it would only do the
	  actual macro/gosub jump if a '^' character existed. This doesn't
	  apply when the macro/gosub jump occurs in a priority/priority
	  label. This patch changes the logic so that the parsing still
	  occurs, but the jump will occur even for priorities/priority
	  labels. (issue ASTERISK-23164) Review:

	  (added), include/asterisk/res_pjsip_pubsub.h: Decouple
	  subscription handling from NOTIFY/PUBLISH body generation. When
	  the PJSIP pubsub framework was created, subscription handlers
	  were required to state what event they handled along with what
	  body types they knew how to generate. While this serves well when
	  implementing a base RFC, it has problems when trying to extend
	  the body to support non-standard or proprietary body elements.
	  The code also was NOTIFY-specific, meaning that when the time
	  comes that we start writing code to send out PUBLISH requests
	  with MWI or presence bodies, we would likely find ourselves
	  duplicating code that had previously been written. This changeset
	  introduces the concept of body generators and body supplements. A
	  body generator is responsible for allocating a native structure
	  for a given body type, providing the primary body content,
	  converting the native structure to a string, and deallocating
	  resources. A body supplement takes the primary body content (the
	  native structure, not a string) generated by the body generator
	  and adds nonstandard elements to the body. With these elements
	  living in their own module, it becomes easy to extend our support
	  for body types and to re-use resources when sending a PUBLISH
	  request. Body generators and body supplements register themselves
	  with the pubsub core, similar to how subscription and publish
	  handlers had done. Now, subscription handlers do not need to know
	  what type of body content they generate, but they still need to
	  inform the pubsub core about what the default body type for a
	  given event package is. The pubsub core keeps track of what body
	  generators and body supplements have been registered. When a
	  SUBSCRIBE arrives, the pubsub core will check that there is a
	  subscription handler for the event in the SUBSCRIBE, then it will
	  check that there is a body generator that can provide the content
	  specified in the Accept header(s). Because of the nature of body
	  generators and supplements, it means res_pjsip_exten_state and
	  res_pjsip_mwi have been completely gutted. They no longer worry
	  about body types, instead calling
	  ast_sip_pubsub_generate_body_content() when they need to generate
	  a NOTIFY body. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3150

	  added the tables in for the missing pjsip configuration options.

	  a case where it had to be done due to errors in the script and

	  fix support for allow=all This change adds improvements to
	  support for allow=all in pjsip.conf so that it functions as
	  intended. Previously, the allow/disallow socery configuration
	  would set & clear codecs from the media.codecs and media.prefs
	  list, but if all was specified the prefs list was not updated.
	  Then a call would fail when create_outgoing_sdp_stream() created
	  an SDP with no audio codecs. A new function
	  ast_codec_pref_append_all() is provided to add all codecs to the
	  prefs list - only those not already on the list. This enables the
	  configuration to specify a codec preference, but still add all
	  codecs, and even then remove some codecs, as shown in this
	  example: allow = ulaw, alaw, all, !g729, !g723 Also, the display
	  order of allow in cli output is updated to match the
	  configuration by using prefs instead of caps when generating a
	  human readable string. Finally, a change to
	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream() skips a codec when it does not have
	  a payload code instead of the call failing. (closes issue

	  endpoints is INVALID When endpoints get loaded their device state
	  gets set to 'INVALID' because the channel driver has not been

	  register regression In ASTERISK-12117, an improvement to insure
	  consistant local from tags on outbound registrations resulted in

	  verbose messages. The per console verbose level feature as
	  previously implemented caused a large performance penalty. The
	  fix required some minor incompatibilities if the new rasterisk is
	  used to connect to an earlier version. If the new rasterisk
	  connects to an older Asterisk version then the root console
	  verbose level is always affected by the "core set verbose"
	  command of the remote console even though it may appear to only
	  affect the current console. If an older version of rasterisk
	  connects to the new version then the "core set verbose" command
	  will have no effect. * Fixed the verbose performance by not
	  generating a verbose message if nothing is going to use it and
	  then filtered any generated verbose messages before actually
	  sending them to the remote consoles. * Split the "core set debug"
	  and "core set verbose" CLI commands to remove the per module
	  verbose support that cannot work with the per console verbose
	  level. * Added a silent option to the "core set verbose" command.
	  * Fixed "core set debug off" tab completion. * Made "core show
	  settings" list the current console verbosity in addition to the
	  root console verbosity. * Changed the default verbose level of
	  the 'verbose' setting in the logger.conf [logfiles] section. The
	  default is now to once again follow the current root console
	  level. As a result, using the AMI Command action with "core set
	  verbose" could again set the root console verbose level and
	  affect the verbose level logged. (closes issue AST-1252) Reported

	* res/res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c: Fix erroneous behavior when
	  sending auth rejection to artificial endpoint. We were not
	  including an authentication challenge when sending a 401 response
	  to unmatched endpoints. This was due to the conversion to use a
	  vector for authentication section names on an endpoint. The
	  vector for artificial endpoints was empty, resulting in the
	  challenge being sent back containing no challenges. This is
	  worked around by placing a bogus value in the artificial
	  endpoint's auth vector. This value is never looked up by
	  anything, since they instead will directly call
	  ast_sip_get_artificial_auth().

	  applications that manipulate CDRs with the engine In
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3057/, applications and
	  functions that manipulate CDRs were made to interact over Stasis.
	  This was done to synchronize manipulations of CDRs from the
	  dialplan with the updates the engine itself receives over the
	  message bus. This change rested on a faulty premise: that
	  messages published to the CDR topic or to a topic that forwards
	  to the CDR topic are synchronized with the messages handled by
	  the CDR topic subscription in the CDR engine. This is not the
	  case. There is no ordering guaranteed for two messages published
	  to the same topic; ordering is only guaranteed if a message is
	  published to the same subscriber. Stasis was modified in r405311
	  to allow a publisher to synchronize on the subscriber. This patch
	  uses that API to synchronize the CDR publishers with the CDR
	  engine message router, which maintains the overall topic
	  subscription. (closes issue ASTERISK-22884) Reported by: Matt

	  a specific subscriber handles the message. Since a subscriber can
	  have their own forwarding topic which orders messages from many
	  topics, this allows a publisher who knows of that subscriber to
	  synchronize to that subscriber regardless of the forwarding
	  relationships between topics. This is of particular use for
	  dialplan applications that need to synchronize on a particular
	  subscriber's handling of a message. (issue ASTERISK-22884)

	  apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c: app_confbridge: Fix
	  crash caused when waitmarked/marked users leave together When
	  waitmarked users join a ConfBridge, the conference state is
	  transitioned from EMPTY -> INACTIVE. In this state, the users are
	  maintined in a waiting users list. When a marked user joins, the
	  ConfBridge conference transitions from INACTIVE -> MULTI_MARKED,
	  and all users are put onto the active list of users. This process
	  works correctly. When the marked user leaves, if they are the
	  last marked user, the MULTI_MARKED state does the following: (1)
	  It plays back a message to the bridge stating that the leader has
	  left the conference. This requires an unlocking of the bridge.
	  (2) It moves waitmarked users back to the waiting list (3) It
	  transitions to the appropriate state: in this case, INACTIVE
	  However, because it plays the prompt back to the bridge before
	  moving the users and before finishing the state transition, this
	  creates a race condition: with the bridge unlocked, waitmarked
	  users who leave the conference (or are kicked from it) can cause
	  a state transition of the bridge to another state before the
	  conference is transitioned to the INACTIVE state. This causes the
	  state machine to get a bit wonky, often leading to a crash when
	  the MULTI_MARKED state attempts to conclude its processing. This
	  patch fixes this problem: (1) It prevents kicked users from being
	  kicked again. That's just a nicety. (2) More importantly, it
	  fixes the race condition by only playing the prompt once the
	  state has transitioned correctly to INACTIVE. If waitmarked users
	  sneak out during the prompt being played, no harm no foul.

	* include/asterisk/manager.h, /: manager: bump version to 2.0.0 AMI
	  has received substantial updates over the past year. Not only has
	  the syntax been vastly improved and made consistent (which
	  entails many event changes), but the underlying things that those
	  events convey have changed substantially as well. After some
	  conversation in #asterisk-dev, it was agreed that this is a good
	  time to jump to 2. At the same time, since ARI will most likely
	  use semantic versioning, we might as well use that for AMI as
	  well. That also affords us greater meaning for the AMI version.

	  another NAT example to pjsip.conf.sample. We had a few mentions
	  of NAT configuration throughout the sample, but I added another
	  for a little bit more clarity. Additionally many pjsip options
	  were affected by the change to snake case, so I fixed any
	  instances of those options in pjsip.conf. I regenerated the
	  config option list (at the bottom of the file) from a new xml
	  config doc dump, so all the snake case changes should be
	  reflected there, as well as any other changes to those options.

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, res/res_pjsip.c, main/channel.c, /,
	  include/asterisk/autochan.h: Fix a deadlock that occurred due to
	  a conflict of masquerades. For the explanation, here is a
	  copy-paste of the review board explanation: Initially, it was
	  discovered that performing an attended transfer of a multiparty
	  bridge with a PJSIP channel would cause a deadlock. A PBX thread
	  started a masquerade and reached the point where it was calling
	  the fixup() callback on the "original" channel. For chan_pjsip,
	  this involves pushing a synchronous task to the session's
	  serializer. The problem was that a task ahead of the fixup task
	  was also attempting to perform a channel masquerade. However,
	  since masquerades are designed in a way to only allow for one to
	  occur at a time, the task ahead of the fixup could not continue
	  until the masquerade already in progress had completed. And of
	  course, the masquerade in progress could not complete until the
	  task ahead of the fixup task had completed. Deadlock. The initial
	  fix was to change the fixup task to be asynchronous. While this
	  prevented the deadlock from occurring, it had the frightful side
	  effect of potentially allowing for tasks in the session's
	  serializer to operate on a zombie channel. Taking a step back
	  from this particular deadlock, it became clear that the problem
	  was not really this one particular issue but that masquerades
	  themselves needed to be addressed. A PJSIP attended transfer
	  operation calls ast_channel_move(), which attempts to both set up
	  and execute a masquerade. The problem was that after it had set
	  up the masquerade, the PBX thread had swooped in and tried to
	  actually perform the masquerade. Looking at changes that had been
	  made to Asterisk 12, it became clear that there never is any time
	  now that anyone ever wants to set up a masquerade and allow for
	  the channel thread to actually perform the masquerade. Everyone
	  always is calling ast_channel_move(), performs the masquerade
	  itself before returning. In this patch, I have removed all blocks
	  of code from channel.c that will attempt to perform a masquerade
	  if ast_channel_masq() returns true. Now, there is no distinction
	  between setting up a masquerade and performing the masquerade. It
	  is one operation. The only remaining checks for
	  ast_channel_masq() and ast_channel_masqr() are in ast_hangup()
	  since we do not want to interrupt a masquerade by hanging up the
	  channel. Instead, now ast_hangup() will wait for a masquerade to
	  complete before moving forward with its operation. The
	  ast_channel_move() function has been modified to basically
	  in-line the logic that used to be in ast_channel_masquerade().
	  ast_channel_masquerade() has been killed off for real.
	  ast_channel_move() now has a lock associated with it that is used
	  to prevent any simultaneous moves from occurring at once. This
	  means there is no need to make sure that ast_channel_masq() or
	  ast_channel_masqr() are already set on a channel when
	  ast_channel_move() is called. It also means the channel container
	  lock is not pulling double duty by both keeping the container
	  locked and preventing multiple masquerades from occurring
	  simultaneously. The ast_do_masquerade() function has been renamed
	  to do_channel_masquerade() and is now internal to channel.c. The
	  function now takes explicit arguments of which channels are
	  involved in the masquerade instead of a single channel. While it
	  probably is possible to do some further refactoring of this
	  method, I feel that I would be treading dangerously. Instead, all
	  I did was change some comments that no longer are true after this
	  changeset. The other more minor change introduced in this patch
	  is to res_pjsip.c to make ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() run the
	  task in-place if we are already a SIP servant thread. This is
	  related to this patch because even when we isolate the channel
	  masquerade to only running in the SIP servant thread, we would
	  still deadlock when the fixup() callback is reached since we
	  would essentially be waiting forever for ourselves to finish
	  before actually running the fixup. This makes it so the fixup is
	  run without having to push a task into a serializer at all.

	  Synchronize with engine when manipulating state When doing the
	  rework of the CDR engine that pushed all of the logic into cdr.c
	  and made it respond to changes in channel state over Stasis, we
	  knew that accessing the CDR engine from the dialplan would be
	  "slightly" non-deterministic. Dialplan threads would be accessing
	  CDRs while Stasis threads would be updating the state of said
	  CDRs - whereas in the past, everything happened on the dialplan
	  threads. Tests have shown that "slightly" is in reality "very".
	  This patch synchronizes things by making the dialplan
	  applications/functions that manipulate CDRs do so over Stasis.
	  ForkCDR, NoCDR, ResetCDR, CDR, and CDR_PROP now all use Stasis to
	  send their requests over to the CDR engine, and synchronize on
	  the channel Stasis topic via a subscription so that they return
	  their values/control to the dialplan at the appropriate time.
	  While going through this, the following changes were also made: *
	  DISA, which can reset the CDR when a user successfully
	  authenticates, now just uses the ResetCDR app to do this. This
	  prevents having to duplicate the same Stasis synchronization
	  logic in that application. * Answer no longer disables CDRs. It
	  actually didn't work anyway - calling DISABLE on the channel's
	  CDR doesn't stop the CDR from getting the Answer time - it just
	  kills all CDRs on that channel, which isn't what the caller would
	  intend. (closes issue ASTERISK-22884) (closes issue

	  channel locking: Add locking for channel snapshot creation
	  Original commit message by mmichelson (asterisk 12 r403311):
	  "This adds channel locks around calls to create channel snapshots
	  as well as other functions which operate on a channel and then
	  end up creating a channel snapshot. Functions that expect the
	  channel to be locked prior to being called have had their
	  documentation updated to indicate such." The above was initially
	  committed and then reverted at r403398. The problem was found to
	  be in core_local.c in the publish_local_bridge_message function.
	  The ast_unreal_lock_all function locks and adds a reference to
	  the returned channels and while they were being unlocked they
	  were not being unreffed when no longer needed. Fixed by unreffing
	  the channels. Also in bridge.c a lock was obtained on
	  "other->chan", but then an attempt was made to unlock "other" and
	  not the previously locked channel. Fixed by unlocking
	  "other->chan" (closes issue ASTERISK-22709) Reported by: John

	* /, res/ari/resource_channels.c: ari/resource_channels: When
	  creating a channel, specify a default format (SLIN) When creating
	  channels via ARI, the current code fails to provide any default
	  format capabilities. For non-virtual channels this isn't really a
	  problem - the channels typically receive their capabilities as a
	  result of the underlying channel driver configuration. For
	  virtual channels (such as Local channels), the lack of any format
	  capabilities causes the Asterisk core to make some 'odd' choices
	  with respect to the translation paths. The issue reporter had
	  some paths that had 3 hops on each channel leg, causing multiple
	  transcodings and some really crappy audio/performance. By
	  specifying a baseline of SLIN, we prevent that from occurring.
	  Note that this is what AMI does when it performs an Originate, as
	  does res_clioriginate. Review:

	  read the channel variable SHELL(rm -rf /) Bad Things(TM) could
	  happen; even if the external source has only read permissions.
	  Execution from external sources may be enabled by setting
	  'live_dangerously' to 'yes' in the [options] section of
	  asterisk.conf. Although doing so is not recommended. Also, the
	  ABI was changed to something more reasonable, since Asterisk 12

	* res/res_pjsip_authenticator_digest.c: Fix correct authentication
	  behavior for artificial endpoint. When switching to using a
	  vector for authentication, I initialized the vector for the
	  artificial endpoint to be of size 1. However, this does not
	  result in AST_VECTOR_SIZE() returning 1 since there isn't
	  actually anything in the vector. Rather than trifle with the
	  vector by putting unnecessary elements in, I simply changed the
	  callback in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest.c to explicitly report
	  that the artificial endpoint requires authentication. Thanks to
	  Joshua Colp for pointing this out.

	* /, res/res_fax_spandsp.c: res_fax_spandsp: Always init T.38
	  session to avoid crashes during state change Prior to this patch,
	  res_fax_spandsp was conservative with how it initialized the
	  spandsp T.38 context. It would only initialize it if the driver
	  thought the current state was a T.38 fax. While this works fine
	  in nominal situations, in certain off nominal situations,
	  res_fax_spandsp can believe that a T.38 fax will not occur when
	  in fact one has started. In particular, this was discovered when
	  res_fax would fall back to audio after timing out on a T.38
	  upgrade. The SIP channel driver would continue to retry the
	  re-INVITE and - if the remote end responded after res_fax timed
	  out with a 200 OK - a T.38 frame would be delivered to the
	  res_fax stack when it no longer expected it. As it turns out,
	  there does not appear to be any downside to always initializing
	  the T.38 context, other than the actual memory allocation. Since
	  that avoids this off nominal situation (and others which are
	  equally likely hard to predict), this is the safest way to avoid
	  this problem. Much thanks to Torrey as well for providing a
	  scenario that reproduces this issue. (closes issue

	  provides a request body with a Content type of
	  "application/json", the provided JSON document is parsed and
	  searched for parameters. The expected fields in the provided JSON
	  document should match the query parameters defined for the
	  operation. If the parameter has 'allowMultiple' set, then the
	  field in the JSON document may optionally be an array of values.

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: crash if first agent is "busy" If
	  the first agent/member (via CLI "queue show") in a queue is
	  "busy" (dnd, circuit busy, etc...) and no agents answered then
	  app_queue would crash. This occurred because while the calling of
	  agent(s) remained valid the channel on "busy" agent would be set
	  to NULL and then later dereferenced upon a second "rna" function
	  call. The original intention of the code is to have only valid
	  "call attempt" objects (channels != NULL) checked while
	  attempting to call agent(s). It does this by building a
	  "call_next" list of valid "call attempt" objects. In the case of
	  the "busy" agent subsequent builds of the valid "call attempt"
	  list would sometimes include (the case mentioned above) an
	  invalid "call attempt" object. The fix was to make sure the "call
	  attempt" list was appropriately built on every iteration. A NULL
	  sanity check was also added at the original offending spot of the
	  crash just in case another one slipped by somehow. (closes issue

	* main/loader.c, /: core/loader: Don't call dlclose in a while loop
	  For awhile now, we've noticed continuous integration builds
	  hanging on CentOS 6 64-bit build agents. After resolving a number
	  of problems with symbols, strange locks, and other shenanigans,
	  the problem has persisted. In all cases, gdb shows the Asterisk
	  process stuck in loader.c on one of the infinite while loops that
	  calls dlclose repeatedly until success. The documentation of
	  dlclose states that it returns 0 on success; any other value on
	  error. It does not state that repeatedly calling it will
	  eventually clear those errors. Most likely, the repeated calls to
	  dlclose was to force a close by exhausting the references on the
	  library; however, that will never succeed if: (a) There is some
	  fundamental error at work in the loaded library that precludes
	  unloading it (b) Some other loaded module is referencing a symbol
	  in the currently loaded module This results in Asterisk sitting
	  forever. Since we have matching pairs of dlopen/dlclose, this
	  patch opts to only call dlclose once, and log out as an ERROR if
	  dlclose fails to return success. If nothing else, this might help
	  to determine why on the CentOS 6 64-bit build agent things are
	  not closing successfully. Review:

	* main/xmldoc.c, main/channel.c, main/pbx.c, /, main/translate.c:
	  Remove some spammy debug messages; improve clarity of others
	  Debug messages aren't free. Even when the debug level is
	  sufficiently low such that the messages are never evaluated,
	  there is a cost to having to parse Asterisk logs that contain
	  debug messages that (a) fail to convey sufficient information or
	  (b) occur so frequently as to be next to meaningless. Based on
	  having to stare at lots of DEBUG messages, this patch makes the
	  following changes: * channel.c: When copying variables from a
	  parent channel to a child channel, specify the channels involved.
	  Do not log anything for a variable that is not inherited; the
	  fact that it doesn't have an _ or __ already signifies that it
	  won't be inherited. * pbx.c: Specify what function evaluation has
	  occurred that created the result. * translate.c: Bump up the
	  translator path messages to 10. I've never once had to use these
	  debug messages, and for each format that is registered (on
	  startup) and unregistered (on shutdown) the entire f^2 matrix is
	  logged out. For short tests in the Asterisk Test Suite, this
	  should make finding the actual test much easier. * xmldoc.c: The
	  debug message that 'blah' is not found in the tree is expected.
	  Often, description elements - which are not required - are not
	  provided. This debug message adds no additional value, as it is
	  not indicative of an error or helpful in debugging which element
	  did not contain a 'blah' element as a child. If an element is
	  supposed to contain a child element, then that XML tree should
	  have failed validation in the first place. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, UPGRADE-12.txt: chan_sip: Clarify
	  'Forcerport' Setting Displayed When Running "sip show peers"
	  While looking at ASTERISK-22236, Walter Doekes pointed out that
	  when running "sip show peers", the setting being displayed can be
	  confusing. The display of "N" used to mean NAT (i.e. yes). The
	  NAT setting has gone through many different changes resulting in
	  the display of different characters to try and convey what the
	  current setting is for 'Forcerport' (A for Auto and Forcerport is
	  currently on, a for Auto but Forcerport is off, Y for yes, and N
	  for no). During the initial code review to try and clarify these
	  settings (especially since "N" no longer meant what it used to
	  mean in prior versions of Asterisk), Mark Michelson suggested
	  using the full space available to display the settings which
	  helped to make the settings very clear. That was a great
	  suggestion. Therefore, this patch does the following: * The
	  column for 'Forcerport' now will show: Auto (Yes), Auto (No),
	  Yes, or No. * A column for the 'Comedia' setting has been added.
	  It too will display the setting in a non-cryptic way: Auto (Yes),
	  Auto (No), Yes, or No. * UPGRADE.txt has been updated to document
	  this change. (closes issue ASTERISK-22728) Reported by: Walter

	  configuration is provided by an external script, such that the
	  actual config.ini file is not used. 2) Enum types have all been
	  given names. This is needed for PostgreSQL script generation. 3)
	  The identifier meetme_confno_starttime_endtime is greater than 30

	  not adopted, since the spec is still in flux, and could change

	  Bridging: Fix orphaned bridge if neither of the joining channels
	  can join. The original issue noted that the bridge is orphaned
	  when res_parking.so is not loaded and a call uses the dial kK
	  flags. A similar issue happens when only one of the park flags is
	  used. In this case you have the bridge with one or the other
	  channel left in it. The channel and bridge will stay around until
	  the channel hangs up. * Fixed the initial bridge channel push
	  failure to act as if the channel were kicked out of the bridge.
	  The bridge then decides if it needs to be dissolved. (closes

	  because it automatically takes care of the object references for

	  the for loop, then the current reference is not cleaned up. In
	  some cases, this is on purpose, but in others there is a leak.

	* /, res/res_fax.c, include/asterisk/channel.h, apps/app_dial.c,
	  main/channel.c: Add channel lock protection around translation
	  path setup. Most callers of ast_channel_make_compatible() happen
	  before the channels enter a two party bridge. With the new
	  bridging framework, two party bridging technologies may also call
	  ast_channel_make_compatible() when there is more than one thread
	  involved with the two channels. * Added channel lock protection
	  in set_format() and ast_channel_make_compatible_helper() when
	  dealing with the channel's native formats while setting up a
	  translation path. * Fixed best_src_fmt and best_dst_fmt usage
	  consistency in ast_channel_make_compatible_helper(). The call to
	  ast_translator_best_choice() got them backwards. * Updated some
	  callers of ast_channel_make_compatible() and the function
	  documentation. There is actually a difference between the two
	  channels passed in. * Fixed the deadlock potential in res_fax.c
	  dealing with ast_channel_make_compatible(). The deadlock
	  potential was already there anyway because res_fax called
	  ast_channel_make_compatible() with chan locked. (closes issue

	* main/channel.c, /: Properly copy/remove the device state cache
	  flag over a masquerade. In r378303 the
	  AST_FLAG_DISABLE_DEVSTATE_CACHE flag was added that tells the
	  devstate system to not cache states for non-real devices.
	  However, when optimizing away channels (ast_do_masquerade), that
	  flag wasn't copied. In my case, using Local devices as queue
	  members created a situation where the endpoint was considered in
	  use, but the state change of the device being available again was
	  ignored (not cached). The endpoint channel was optimized into the
	  (previously) Local channel, but kept the do-not-cache flag. The
	  end result being that the queue member apparently stayed in use

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Setting A chan_sip Dialog's
	  SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT Flag A condition was added in a commit to fix
	  ASTERISK-21374, that, if the SIP_PAGE3_NAT_AUTO_RPORT flag was
	  set, to then copy a peer's SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT flag to the
	  dialog. This condition should not have been there since it
	  assumed that if Asterisk is in an environment where NAT is
	  involved, that the auto_* nat settings or force_rport setting
	  would be on in the global settings. If the nat setting in the
	  global setting is set to 'nat=no' and then turned on for peers
	  (which is not quite the recommended way, although it is allowed)
	  this flag is never copied to the dialog resulting in problems
	  like, REGISTER replies going to the wrong port. This patch
	  removes this conditional check and will now always use the peer's
	  flag which by this point in the code the checks on whether the
	  peer is behind NAT or not (if using auto_force_rport) have
	  already been run. (closes issue ASTERISK-22236) Reported by:

	* res/res_pjsip_header_funcs.c (added), /: Add PJSIP_HEADER
	  function for manipulation of SIP headers in the PJSIP stack This
	  patch adds support to the PJSIP stack in Asterisk for SIP header
	  manipulation. Note that this is analagous to
	  SIPAddHeader/SIPRemoveHeader. For PJSIP_HEADER, an incoming
	  supplemental session callback is registered that takes the
	  pjsip_hdrs from the incoming session and stores them in a linked
	  list in the session datastore. Calls to PJSIP_HEADER traverse
	  over the list and return the nth matching header where 'n' is the
	  'number' argument to the function. When adding a header, the
	  first call creates a datastore and linked list and adds the
	  datastore to the session. The header is then created as a
	  pjsip_hdr and added to the list. An outgoing supplemental session
	  callback then traverses the list and adds the headers to the
	  outgoing pjsip_msg. When removing a header, the list created with
	  PJSIP_HEADER(add,...) is traversed and all matching entries are
	  removed. (closes issue ASTERISK-22498) Reported by: George Joseph

	* /, main/channel_internal_api.c: Remove publication of a channel
	  snapshot when the technology is set This patch removes said
	  publication for a few reasons: (1) It is unnecessary. Association
	  of the channel technology with a specific channel is an
	  implementation detail that should be assumed to "just happen",
	  and consumers of Stasis don't need to be informed about it. (2)
	  Publication of said message can now cause crashes, as the actual
	  creation of a channel in normal locations now stages its
	  messages. As a result, things that create dummy channels (such as
	  the SIP RTP QOS unit test) and associate them with a channel
	  technology were now crashing, as the channel itself was not known
	  by Stasis. ........ Merged revisions 400460 from

	* bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c, /,
	  include/asterisk/bridge_technology.h: Fix assumption in
	  bridge_native_rtp.c regarding number of participants in a bridge.
	  When a party leaves a bridge, there may be more participants in
	  the bridge than expected. As such, it is important not to make
	  assumptions regarding the list of channels in a bridge. This
	  change makes it so that when a party leaves a native RTP bridge,
	  we unbridge it and the party it was bridged with. Previously, the
	  first and last channels in the list were unbridged since it was
	  assumed that these were the two channels that had been bridged.
	  As previously stated, a new party had been inserted into the
	  bridge, so this logic did not work properly. (closes issue

	  Channel snapshots have string representations of the channel's
	  native formats. Prior to this change, the format strings were
	  re-created on ever channel snapshot creation. Since channel
	  native formats rarely change, this was very wasteful. Now, string
	  representations of formats may optionally be stored on the
	  ast_format_cap for cases where string representations may be
	  requested frequently. When formats are altered, the string cache
	  is marked as invalid. When strings are requested, the cache
	  validity is checked. If the cache is valid, then the cached
	  strings are copied. If the cache is invalid, then the string
	  cache is rebuilt and copied, and the cache is marked as being
	  valid again. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2879

	  improvements This patch addresses several performance problems
	  that were found in the initial performance testing of Asterisk
	  12. The Stasis dispatch object was allocated as an AO2 object,
	  even though it has a very confined lifecycle. This was replaced
	  with a straight ast_malloc(). The Stasis message router was
	  spending an inordinate amount of time searching hash tables. In
	  this case, most of our routers had 6 or fewer routes in them to
	  begin with. This was replaced with an array that's searched
	  linearly for the route. We more heavily rely on AO2 objects in
	  Asterisk 12, and the memset() in ao2_ref() actually became
	  noticeable on the profile. This was #ifdef'ed to only run when
	  AO2_DEBUG was enabled. After being misled by an erroneous comment
	  in taskprocessor.c during profiling, the wrong comment was
	  removed. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2873/

	  taskprocessors This patch optimizes taskprocessor to use a
	  semaphore for signaling, which the OS can do a better job at
	  managing contention and waiting that we can with a mutex and
	  condition. The taskprocessor execution was also slightly
	  optimized to reduce the number of locks taken. The only
	  observable difference in the taskprocessor implementation is that
	  when the final reference to the taskprocessor goes away, it will
	  execute all tasks to completion instead of discarding the
	  unexecuted tasks. For systems where unnamed semaphores are not
	  supported, a really simple semaphore implementation is provided.
	  (Which gives identical performance as the original taskprocessor
	  implementation). The way we ended up implementing Stasis caused
	  the threadpool to be a burden instead of a boost to performance.
	  This was switched to just use taskprocessors directly for
	  subscriptions. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2881/

	  2013) | 28 lines Optimize how Stasis forwards are dispatched This
	  patch optimizes how forwards are dispatched in Stasis.
	  Originally, forwards were dispatched as subscriptions that are
	  invoked on the publishing thread. This did not account for the
	  vast number of forwards we would end up having in the system, and
	  the amount of work it would take to walk though the forward
	  subscriptions. This patch modifies Stasis so that rather than
	  walking the tree of forwards on every dispatch, when forwards and
	  subscriptions are changed, the subscriber list for every topic in
	  the tree is changed. This has a couple of benefits. First, this
	  reduces the workload of dispatching messages. It also reduces
	  contention when dispatching to different topics that happen to
	  forward to the same aggregation topic (as happens with all of the
	  channel, bridge and endpoint topics). Since forwards are no
	  longer subscriptions, the bulk of this patch is simply changing
	  stasis_subscription objects to stasis_forward objects (which,
	  admittedly, I should have done in the first place.) Since this
	  required me to yet again put in a growing array, I finally
	  abstracted that out into a set of ast_vector macros in
	  asterisk/vector.h. Review:

	  | 2013-09-30 13:48:57 -0500 (Mon, 30 Sep 2013) | 28 lines Remove
	  dispatch object allocation from Stasis publishing While looking
	  for areas for performance improvement, I realized that an unused
	  feature in Stasis was negatively impacting performance. When a
	  message is sent to a subscriber, a dispatch object is allocated
	  for the dispatch, containing the topic the message was published
	  to, the subscriber the message is being sent to, and the message
	  itself. The topic is actually unused by any subscriber in
	  Asterisk today. And the subscriber is associated with the
	  taskprocessor the message is being dispatched to. First, this
	  patch removes the unused topic parameter from Stasis subscription
	  callbacks. Second, this patch introduces the concept of
	  taskprocessor local data, data that may be set on a taskprocessor
	  and provided along with the data pointer when a task is pushed
	  using the ast_taskprocessor_push_local() call. This allows the
	  task to have both data specific to that taskprocessor, in
	  addition to data specific to that invocation. With those two
	  changes, the dispatch object can be removed completely, and the
	  message is simply refcounted and sent directly to the
	  taskprocessor. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2884/

	  This adds a global option in chan_sip to allow it to continue
	  attempting registration if a 403 is received, clearing the cached
	  nonce and treating it as a non-fatal response. Normally, this
	  would cause registration attempts to that endpoint to stop. This

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, /: res_rtp_asterisk: Correct erroneous
	  lost packet information in RTCP reports RTCP's calculation of the
	  number of lost packets in an RTP stream is based on that stream's
	  sequence number count, the number of received packets, and how
	  many packets we expect to receive. When the SSRC for an RTP
	  stream changes, there can - and almost always will be - a large
	  jump in the next packet's timestamp and sequence number. If we
	  don't reset the number of received packets, sequence number
	  count, and other metrics used by RTCP, the next RR/SR report will
	  use the previous SSRC's values to calculate the lost packet count
	  for the new SSRC - resulting in a very large number of lost
	  packets. This patch modifies res_rtp_asterisk such that, if it
	  detects a SSRC change, it will reset the various values used by
	  the RTCP calculations. From the perspective of RTCP, this appears
	  as a new media stream - which is what it is. Review:

	* main/cdr.c, /: CDR: Improve handling of parking; resolve
	  assertion when originating into park This patch covers two
	  problems: 1) Currently, when a call is transferred into a parking
	  lot from a bridge (using either the blind transfer or one touch
	  parking mechanisms), the application fails to be set to "Park" in
	  the resulting CDR record for the parked channel. This is due to
	  the ParkedCall message arriving before the BridgeEnter for the
	  channel entering the parking bridge. The ParkedCall message isn't
	  handled as the CDR for the channel has already been finalized
	  (due to the channel having left its two party bridge), and the
	  BridgeEnter - which creates the new CDR - doesn't have the
	  parking information. This patch modifies the behavior so that
	  reception of a ParkedCall message will - if not handled by a CDR
	  chain - cause a new CDR to be created and put into the Parking
	  state. 2) It fixes a FRACK that occurred when a channel is
	  originated into a parking space. The DialedPending state - which
	  occurs for both Dialed and Originated channels - assumed that it
	  couldn't handle the parking transitions due to it having a Party
	  B; however, Originated channels don't have a Party B. As such,
	  the existing CDR needs to transition into the parking state -
	  this patch does that. Review:

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: Make manager events tolerant of
	  Local channel shenanigans app_queue currently attempts to handle
	  Local channel optimizations in an effort to provide accurate
	  information in Stasis messages (and their corresponding AMI
	  events) as well as the Queue log. Sometimes, however, things
	  don't go as planned. Consider the following scenario: SIP/foo <->
	  L;1 <-> L;2 <-> SIP/agent SIP/agent answers, triggering a Local
	  channel optimization. app_queue will normally do the following: *
	  Listen for the Local optimization events and update our agent
	  accordingly to SIP/agent in the queue log and messages * When we
	  get a hangup, publish the AgentComplete event based on our
	  information (SIP/foo and SIP/agent) However, as with all things
	  that depend on sanity from something as capricious as Local
	  channels, things can go wrong: (1) SIP/agent immediately hangs up
	  upon answering. This triggers a race condition between
	  termination messages coming from SIP/agent and the ongoing Local
	  channel optimization messages. (Note that this can also occur
	  with SIP/foo) (2) In a race condition, Asterisk can (rarely)
	  deliver the hangup messages prior to the Local channel
	  optimization. In that case, the messages *may* arrive to
	  app_queue in the following order: * Hangup SIP/Agent * Hangup
	  SIP/foo * Optimize L;1/L;2 * Hangup L;2 * Hangup L;1 When
	  app_queue receives the hangup of the agent or the caller, it will
	  attempt to publish the AgentComplete event. However, it now has a
	  problem - it thinks its agent is the ;1 side of the Local
	  channel, as it never received the optimization event. At the same
	  time, that channel is already gone. This results in getting NULL
	  from the Stasis cache. What's more, we can't really wait for the
	  optimization message, as we are currently handling the hangup of
	  the channel that the optimization event would tell us to use.
	  This patch modifies the behavior in app_queue such that, since we
	  still have a lot of pertinent queue information (interface, queue
	  name, etc.), we now raise the event with what information we
	  know. The channels involved now may or may not be present. Users
	  will still at least get the "AgentComplete" event, which
	  "completes" the known Agent information. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Fix Realtime Peer Update
	  Problem When Un-registering And Expires Header In 200ok 1st Issue
	  When a realtime peer sends an un-REGISTER request, Asterisk
	  un-registers the peer but the database table record still has
	  regseconds and fullcontact for the peer. This results in calls
	  attempting to be routed to the peer which is no longer
	  registered. The expected behavior is to get busy/congested when
	  attempting to call an un-registered peer through the dialplan.
	  What was discovered is that we are clearing out the peer's
	  registration in the database in parse_register_contact() when
	  calling expire_register() but then upon returning from
	  parse_register_contact(), update_peer() is run which stores back
	  in the database table regseconds and fullcontact. 2nd Issue The
	  reporter pointed out that the 200 ok being returned by Asterisk
	  after un-registering a peer contains a Contact header with
	  ;expires= and the Expires header is not set to 0. This is
	  actually a regression. Tests were created for this second issue
	  (ASTERISK-22548). The tests have been reviewed and a Ship It! was
	  received on those tests. This patch does the following: * Do not
	  ignore the Expires header value even when it is set to 0. The
	  patch sets the pvt->expiry earlier on in the function so that it
	  is set properly and used. * If pvt->expiry is 0, do not call
	  update_peer since that means the peer has already been
	  un-registered and there is no need to update the database record
	  again since nothing has changed. (closes issue ASTERISK-22428)

	* main/stasis_bridges.c, tests/test_cdr.c, main/cdr.c, /: Fix a
	  performance problem CDRs There is a large performance price
	  currently in the CDR engine. We currently perform two
	  ao2_callback calls on a container that has an entry for every
	  channel in the system. This is done to create matching pairs
	  between channels in a bridge. As such, the portion of the CDR
	  logic that this patch deals with is how we make pairings when a
	  channel enters a mixing bridge. In general, when a channel enters
	  such a bridge, we need to do two things: (1) Figure out if anyone
	  in the bridge can be this channel's Party B. (2) Make pairings
	  with every other channel in the bridge that is not already our
	  Party B. This is a two step process. In the first step, we look
	  through everyone in the bridge and see if they can be our Party B
	  (single_state_process_bridge_enter). If they can - yay! We mark
	  our CDR as having gotten a Party B. If not, we keep searching. If
	  we don't find one, we wait until someone joins who can be our
	  Party B. Step 2 is where we changed the logic
	  (handle_bridge_pairings and bridge_candidate_process).
	  Previously, we would first find candidates - those channels in
	  the bridge with us - from the active_cdrs_by_channel container.
	  Because a channel could be a candidate if it was Party B to an
	  item in the container, the code implemented multiple
	  ao2_container callbacks to get all the candidates. We also had to
	  store them in another container with some other meta information.
	  This was rather complex and costly, particularly if you have 300
	  Local channels (600 channels!) going at once. Luckily, none of it
	  is needed: when a channel enters a bridge (which is when we're
	  figuring all this stuff out), the bridge snapshot tells us the
	  unique IDs of everyone already in the bridge. All we need to do
	  is: For all channels in the bridge: If the channel is us or our
	  Party B that we got in step 1, skip it Compare us and the
	  candidate to figure out who is Party A (based on some specific
	  rules) If we are Party A: Make a new CDR for us, append it to our
	  chain, and set the candidate as Party B If they are Party A: If
	  they don't have a Party B: Make a new CDR for them, append us to
	  their chain, and us as Party B Otherwise: Copy us over as Party B
	  on their existing CDR. This patch does that. Because we now use
	  channel unique IDs to find the candidates during bridging,
	  active_cdrs_by_channel now looks up things using uniqueid instead
	  of channel name. This makes the more complex code simpler; it
	  does, however, have the drawback that dialplan applications and
	  functions will be slightly slower as they have to iterate through
	  the container looking for the CDR by name. That's a small price
	  to pay however as the bridging code will be called a lot more
	  often. This patch also does two other minor changes: (1) It
	  reduces the container size of the channels in a bridge snapshot
	  to 1. In order to be predictable for multi-party bridges, the
	  order of the channels in the container must be stable; that is,
	  it must always devolve to a linked list. (2) CDRs and the
	  multi-party test was updated to show the relationship between two
	  dialed channels. You still want to know if they talked -
	  previously, dialed channels were always ignored, which is wrong
	  when they have managed to get a Party B. (closes issue

	* res/res_pjsip.c, res/res_pjsip_session.c, /: Fix crash in
	  res_pjsip on load if error occurs, and prevent unloading of
	  res_pjsip and res_pjsip_session. During load time in res_pjsip if
	  an error occurred the operation would attempt to rollback all
	  operations done during load. This is not permitted by PJSIP as it
	  will assert if the operation has not been done. This fix changes
	  the code so it will only rollback what has been initialized
	  already. Further changes also prevent res_pjsip and
	  res_pjsip_session from being unloaded. This is due to limitations
	  within PJSIP itself. The library environment can only be changed
	  to a certain extent and does not provide the ability, currently,
	  to deinitialize certain required functionality. (closes issue

	* apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c, /: Confbridge: empty
	  conference not being torn down Confbridge would not properly tear
	  down an empty conference bridge when all users were kicked via
	  end_marked=yes and at least one user was also set to wait_marked.
	  This occurred because while end_marked users were being kicked
	  and at least one was also set to wait_marked then the leave
	  wait_marked handler would be called on that user, but there would
	  be no waiting user (still considered active). The waiting users
	  would decrement and now be negative. The conference would remain,
	  but be put into an inactive state. The solution was to move from
	  the active list to the wait list, those users with wait_marked
	  set right before kicking. This allows both the active and wait
	  users to decrement correctly and the confbridge to tear down
	  properly. A crashed also occurred when trying to list the
	  specific conference from the CLI. This happened because the
	  conference specified was invalid. Since the conference properly
	  tears down now there is no way to reference it thus alleviating
	  the crash as well. (closes issue ASTERISK-21859) Reported by:

	  iax.conf instead of using the expiry time that is provided by the
	  client. The provided expiry time of the client is updated after
	  inserting the astdb entry. As a consequence, restarting or
	  reloading asterisk creates clients whose registration may expire
	  before they reregister. The clients are therefore unavailable
	  after minregexpire seconds until they reregister. * Move updating
	  of the expiry time to before inserting into the astdb. (closes

	* main/cdr.c, /: Filter internal channels out of bridge enter/leave
	  message handling Some channels exist merely as an implementation
	  detail in Asterisk, such as ConfBridge's announcer/recorder
	  channels. These channels should never be exposed to the outside
	  world, or to interfaces that report on Asterisk. We already
	  filter out such channels in snapshot processing; however, we
	  failed to filter out bridge related messages that involved these
	  channels. This patch filters out bridge related messages that are
	  for such channels. This prevents a spurious WARNING message from
	  being displayed when those channels move in and out of bridges.

	* /, main/utils.c, include/asterisk/lock.h, main/lock.c: Fix
	  DEBUG_THREADS when lock is acquired in __constructor__ This patch
	  fixes some long-standing bugs in debug threads that were
	  exacerbated with recent Optional API work in Asterisk 12. With
	  debug threads enabled, on some systems, there's a lock ordering
	  problem between our mutex and glibc's mutex protecting its module
	  list (Ubuntu Lucid, glibc 2.11.1 in this instance). In one
	  thread, the module list will be locked before acquiring our
	  mutex. In another thread, our mutex will be locked before locking
	  the module list (which happens in the depths of calling
	  backtrace()). This patch fixes this issue by moving backtrace()
	  calls outside of critical sections that have the mutex acquired.
	  The bigger change was to reentrancy tracking for
	  ast_cond_{timed,}wait, which wrongly assumed that waiting on the
	  mutex was equivalent to a single unlock (it actually suspends all
	  recursive locks on the mutex). (closes issue ASTERISK-22455)

	* /, res/res_xmpp.c: Prevent XMPP timeout on blank responses
	  Sometimes the Google Voice servers have a bad habit of sending
	  out 1 byte replies to the xmpp resource. When a blank 1 byte
	  reply is received from the socket the buffer attempts to wait
	  (endlessly) for the rest of the reply from google which
	  effectively blocks the socket and google voice calls will no
	  longer come into the server. This patch allows the xmpp module to
	  correctly detect empty packets and send out ping replies to
	  google. It also sets a socket timeout on the default socket which
	  prevents the xmpp socket from closing and preventing future
	  google voice calls from coming into the server. Furthermore
	  instead of sending an empty reply back to google we send a proper
	  xmpp ping reply back. This also adds several more socket
	  messages. (closes issue ASTERISK-22347) Reported by: Andrew Nagy

	  optional_api: Fix linking problems between modules that export
	  global symbols With the new work in Asterisk 12, there are some
	  uses of the optional_api that are prone to failure. The details
	  are rather involved, and captured on [the wiki][1]. This patch
	  addresses the issue by removing almost all of the magic from the
	  optional API implementation. Instead of relying on weak symbol
	  resolution, a new optional_api.c module was added to Asterisk
	  core. For modules providing an optional API, the pointer to the
	  implementation function is registered with the core. For modules
	  that use an optional API, a pointer to a stub function, along
	  with a optional_ref function pointer are registered with the
	  core. The optional_ref function pointers is set to the
	  implementation function when it's provided, or the stub function
	  when it's now. Since the implementation no longer relies on
	  magic, it is now supported on all platforms. In the spirit of
	  choice, an OPTIONAL_API flag was added, so we can disable the
	  optional_api if needed (maybe it's buggy on some bizarre platform
	  I haven't tested on) The AST_OPTIONAL_API*() macros themselves
	  remained unchanged, so existing code could remain unchanged. But
	  to help with debugging the optional_api, the patch limits the
	  #include of optional API's to just the modules using the API.
	  This also reduces resource waste maintaining optional_ref
	  pointers that aren't used. Other changes made as a part of this
	  patch: * The stubs for http_websocket that wrap system calls set
	  errno to ENOSYS. * res_http_websocket now properly increments
	  module use count. * In loader.c, the while() wrappers around
	  dlclose() were removed. The while(!dlclose()) is actually an
	  anti-pattern, which can lead to infinite loops if the module
	  you're attempting to unload exports a symbol that was directly
	  linked to. * The special handling of nonoptreq on systems without
	  weak symbol support was removed, since we no longer rely on weak
	  symbols for optional_api. [1]:

	  his patch implements the ARI API's for stored recordings. While
	  the original task only specified deleting a recording, it was
	  simple enough to implement the GET for all recordings, and for an
	  individual recording. The recording playback operation was
	  modified to use the same code for accessing the recording as the
	  REST API, so that they will behave consistently. There were
	  several problems with the api-docs that were also fixed, bringing
	  the ARI spec in line with the implementation. There were some
	  'wishful thinking' fields on the stored recording model (duration
	  and timestamp) that were removed, because I ended up not
	  implementing a metadata file to go along with the recording to
	  store such information. The GET /recordings/live operation was
	  removed, since it's not really that useful to get a list of all
	  recordings that are currently going on in the system. (At least,
	  if we did that, we'd probably want to also list all of the
	  current playbacks. Which seems weird.) (closes issue

	* res/res_pjsip_session.c, /: Fix a race condition where a canceled
	  call was answered. RFC 5407 section 3.1.2 details a scenario
	  where a UAC sends a CANCEL at the same time that a UAS sends a
	  200 OK for the INVITE that the UAC is canceling. When this
	  occurs, it is the role of the UAC to immediately send a BYE to
	  terminate the call. This scenario was reproducible by have a
	  Digium phone with two lines place a call to a second phone that
	  forwarded the call to the second line on the original phone. The
	  Digium phone, upon realizing that it was connecting to itself,
	  would attempt to cancel the call. The timing of this happened to
	  trigger the aforementioned race condition about 80% of the time.
	  Asterisk was not doing its job of sending a BYE when receiving a
	  200 OK on a cancelled INVITE. The result was that the ast_channel
	  structure was destroyed but the underlying SIP session, as well
	  as the PJSIP inv_session and dialog, were still alive. Attempting
	  to perform an action such as a transfer, once in this state,
	  would result in Asterisk crashing. The circumstances are now
	  detected properly and the session is ended as recommended in RFC
	  5407. (closes issue AST-1209) reported by John Bigelow ........

	* /, res/res_pjsip_refer.c: Improve detection of answer on SIP
	  blind transfer. A problem encountered during testing was that
	  res_pjsip_refer would not ever send a NOTIFY with a 200 OK
	  sipfrag. This is because the framehook that was supposed to send
	  the NOTIFY would never be told that an answer had occurred. This
	  happened for two reasons: 1) The transferee channel on which the
	  framehook was on was already up. 2) Answers are rarely if ever
	  written to channels. Rather, the ast_answer() or ast_raw_answer()
	  function is used to answer channels. Thanks to a suggestion by
	  Matt Jordan, the best way to detect that the call had been
	  answered was to find out when the transferee channel joined a
	  bridge. With stasis this is an easy task. So now, in addition to
	  the framehook logic, there is a stasis subscription used to
	  determine when the transferee has entered a bridge. Once it has
	  entered, an appropriate NOTIFY is sent. ........ Merged revisions

	* res/res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c, /: Fix dialog matching in the
	  SIP distributor. Dialog matching is performed in the distributor
	  for the sole purpose of retrieving an associated serializer so
	  the request may be serialized. This patch fixes two problems.
	  First, incoming CANCEL requests that had no to-tag (which really
	  should be *all* CANCEL requests) would not match with a dialog.
	  An earlier bug fix to deal with early CANCEL requests would
	  result in the CANCEL being replied to with a 481. The fix for
	  this is to find the matching INVITE transaction and get the
	  dialog from that transaction. Second, no SIP responses were
	  matching dialogs. This is because we were inverting the tags that
	  we were passing into PJSIP's dialog finding function. This logic
	  has been corrected by setting local and remote tag variables
	  based on whether the incoming message is a request or response.

	  cleanup Stasis events (which get distributed over the ARI
	  WebSocket) are created by subscribing to the channel_all_cached
	  and bridge_all_cached topics, filtering out events for
	  channels/bridges currently subscribed to. There are two issues
	  with that. First was a race condition, where messages in-flight
	  to the master subscribe-to-all-things topic would get sent out,
	  even though the events happened before the channel was put into
	  Stasis. Secondly, as the number of channels and bridges grow in
	  the system, the work spent filtering messages becomes excessive.
	  Since r395954, individual channels and bridges have caching
	  topics, and can be subscribed to individually. This patch takes
	  advantage, so that channels and bridges are subscribed to on
	  demand, instead of filtering the global topics. The one case
	  where filtering is still required is handling BridgeMerge
	  messages, which are published directly to the bridge_all topic.
	  Other than the change to how subscriptions work, this patch
	  mostly just moves code around. Most of the work generating JSON
	  objects from messages was moved to .to_json handlers on the
	  message types. The callback functions handling app subscriptions
	  were moved from res_stasis (b/c they were global to the model) to
	  stasis/app.c (b/c they are local to the app now). (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: AST-2013-004: Fix crash when handling ACK
	  on dialog that has no channel A remote exploitable crash
	  vulnerability exists in the SIP channel driver if an ACK with SDP
	  is received after the channel has been terminated. The handling
	  code incorrectly assumed that the channel would always be
	  present. This patch adds a check such that the SDP will only be
	  parsed and applied if Asterisk has a channel present that is
	  associated with the dialog. Note that the patch being applied was
	  modified only slightly from the patch provided by Walter Doekes
	  of OSSO B.V. (closes issue ASTERISK-21064) Reported by: Colin

	* /, main/bridge_channel.c: Better handle clearing the OUTGOING
	  flag when a channel leaves a bridge When a channel with the
	  OUTGOING flag leaves a bridge, and it will survive being pulled
	  from the bridge (either because it will execute dialplan, go into
	  another bridge, or live in a friendly autoloop), we have to clear
	  the OUTGOING flag. This is the signal to the CDR engine that this
	  channel is no longer a second class citizen, i.e., it is not
	  "dialed". The soft hangup flags are only half the picture. If a
	  channel is being moved from one bridge to another, the soft
	  hangup flags aren't set; however, the state of the bridge_channel
	  will not be hung up. Since the channel does not have one of the
	  two hang up states, that implies that the channel is still
	  technically alive. This patch modifies the check so that it
	  checks both the soft hangup flags as well as the bridge_channel
	  state. If either suggests that the channel is going to persist,
	  we clear the OUTGOING flag. ........ Merged revisions 397690 from

	* tests/test_bucket.c, /: Fix bucket unit tests After the review
	  for buckets was completed (r2715), the handling of names in the
	  bucket core was deferred to the wizards. As such, the bucket unit
	  tests cannot expect that passing a URI with a scheme specified
	  but no actual resource name will automatically fail. The tests
	  have been updated to not make this check. ........ Merged

	  too. As an aside, please do not use this power for evil.
	  Documentation is your friend, and you really should document your
	  configurations. Hiding your module's configuration information
	  from the system attempting to enforce some sanity in the universe
	  is something only a Bond villain would contemplate. ........

	* /, res/res_pjsip/pjsip_configuration.c: Add rtpengine
	  configuration parameter The rtpengine configuration parameter was
	  documented in the XML documentation, but it was not actually
	  registered with the sorcery object. This adds the parameter with
	  a default of "asterisk", such that res_rtp_asterisk is chosen as
	  the default RTP implementation. (closes issue ASTERISK-22380)
