	* channels/chan_sip.c: Rip out half implementation of 491 response
	  support, since it wasn't implemented properly and caused memory
	  leaks in the case of us getting 491's, which Asterisk actually
	  sends... Since it is a bit too complicated to fix this, I'll rip
	  it out of 1.4 and put it on the to-do-list for future releases.
	  Now, we handle this as congestion, which it really is. Issue
	  #8331

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix bit definition for SIP_PAG2_CALL_ONHOLD.

	  build_tools/prep_moduledeps: Work around an issue that caused
	  menuselect to display a bogus description for app_voicemail and
	  chan_zap. These modules use some preprocessor directives to
	  determine what it will report to Asterisk as its description.
	  However, the way we extract this information from the source
	  files for menuselect is not smart enough to figure this out.

	* main/cli.c: Fix "core show channel". Also, fix tab completion for
	  both "core show channel" and "core show channels".

	* main/cli.c: Fix "core debug channel <whatever>". I guess someone
	  needs to go through and audit every CLI command that changed

	  will only happen if we know we're calling soxmix, and not a
	  custom script defined using the MONITOR_EXEC variable. The wav49

	* main/translate.c: - If the source has no audio or no video
	  portion, do not call powerof() to get the format index. - Don't
	  run through the audio and video loops if there is no audio or
	  video portion of the source If 0 is passed to powerof, it will
	  return -1. This value of -1 was then being used as an array index
	  in these loops, which caused a crash on some systems. Other than
	  this issue, this code works as we expected it to. If a format is
	  not in the source, and we have to translation path to it, it is
	  not offered in the list of acceptable destination formats. (fixes
	  issue #8231)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Let's understand SIP: - REFER can create
	  dialog, Asterisk does not support it yet - NOTIFY can create
	  dialog in Asterisk's implementation (voicemail) even though we
	  don't support the server side of it. In this case, the standard
	  is a side issue ;-) - Added extened functionality for unsupported
	  methods (PING, PUBLISH) so we don't create PVT's for those
	  either. Russellb needs to judge what to do with this in 1.2, but
	  I think the current implementation n 1.2 is a bug since we're
	  sending bad replies to NOTIFY and REFER outside of dialogs

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed segfault which happens during
	  hold/transfer action

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: if INFORMATION Message come with keypad
	  instead of called party number, we just use the keypad as called
	  party number.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn_config.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h, configs/misdn.conf.sample:
	  added the option 'reject_cause' to make it possible to set
	  the RELEASE_COMPLETE - cause on the 3. incoming PMP channel,
	  which is automatically rejected because chan_misdn does not
	  support that kind of callwaiting. Therefore chan_misdn supports
	  now 3 incoming channels on a PMP BRI Port. misdn_lib_get_free_bc
	  now gets the info if the requested channel is incoming or
	  outgoing to make the 3. channel possible

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h,
	  channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed the hold/retrieve/transfer issues,

	* CHANGES: I put the accumulated changes from the commit logs and
	  inspection, into CHANGES. Hope everyone approves!

	* configs/muted.conf.sample, utils/muted.c: Hang on a minute, the
	  install process sticks muted.conf in /etc/asterisk, so that's
	  where muted should look for it, right?

2006-10-05 02:40 +0000 [r44450]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2006-10-02 20:11 +0000 [r44199-44215]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change the fd on the I/O context in case it
	  changed during the reload, which is indeed possible. (issue #7943

2006-10-01 18:30 +0000 [r44111-44125]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Fix a problem that cuased AST_DATA_DIR in defaults.h to
	  be empty. The cause is that since ASTDATADIR is explicitly
	  exported using "export ASTDATADIR" at the top of the Makefile,
	  make no longer considers the variable "undefined", so the
	  Makefile can't use ?= to set ASTDATADIR if not yet set. (issue
	  #8063, reported by akohlsmith, fixed by me)

	* configs/queues.conf.sample: Fix the name of the "eventmemberstatus"
	  option in the sample queues.conf (issue #8065, adamg)

2006-10-01 15:01 +0000 [r44109]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

2006-09-30 16:28 +0000 [r44080]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* codecs/lpc10/Makefile, Makefile, main/Makefile: fix two recent
	  build problems: - with AST_DEVMODE, building codecs/lpc10 fails
	  because of lots of warnings, and the configure step in editline
	  fails as well. Fix this by removing the -Werror in these steps. -
	  on FreeBSD (but probably on other platforms as well), the final
	  link of asterisk fails because AST_LIBS was not exported to the
	  subdirs Makefiles. Add a proper fix in the top-level Makefile (a
	  possible alternative way is to add "export AST_LIBS" near the
	  beginning of the file). With this fix, i believe that some of the
	  platform-specific conditionals in main/Makefile are redundant
	  (because they should be already dealt with in the top level
	  Makefile) but i don't have a platform to check. Merging to head
	  will happen in a moment.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix issue #7928 correctly. Next is a comment
	  of previous fix: Issue #7928 - Don't send both 404 and 503. Fix
	  by phsultan with a small fix by me, myself or I. Thanks,
	  Philippe! (This was caused by my changes to the transaction
	  handling)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Found some buggy SIP clients (phones Planet
	  VIP-153T firmware 1.0, Linksys PAP2 firmware 3.1.9(LSc)) which
	  sends ACK not on OK message only (when remote party answers) but
	  on RINGING message too, so when we send 200 OK message, we get
	  unidentified ACK message (because INVITE acknowledged on RINGING
	  message already), so 200 OK retransmits within its retransmission
	  interval then call gets dropped. If someone else knows how to
	  provide workaround for such cases, please, fix it in correct way.
	  Thanks to ssh from #asteriskru for provide access to his box to
	  study and fix this case.

	* channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx: Set TON/PRESENTATION information more
	  carefully when no CallingNumber IE available

	* channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx: Fake display name by called number on

	* channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx: Ported code refers to H.450 - add
	  includes

	* channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx, channels/h323/ast_h323.h: Properly

	* main/db1-ast/Makefile, Makefile, codecs/Makefile, utils/Makefile,
	  main/Makefile, codecs/gsm/Makefile, Makefile.moddir_rules,
	  Makefile.rules, pbx/Makefile, channels/Makefile: don't abuse
	  CFLAGS and LDFLAGS for build of Asterisk components, because they
	  are also then used for non-Asterisk components (like menuselect);
	  use our own variables instead

	* configure, configure.ac: support --without-curl in configure
	  script

	* Makefile.rules: another cross-compile fix

	* Makefile: a couple more environment settings that can't leak into
	  the menuselect build

	* main/cli.c: proper fix for ast_group_t change

	* apps/app_queue.c: app_queue is comparing the device names incorrectly
	  while checking their statuses. It's internal list of interfaces
	  includes the dial string, while the argument passed to this
	  function does not have the dial string (/n for a local channel).
	  This causes it to ignore the device state changes because it

	* apps/app_playback.c, main/pbx.c: Fix an issue with PLAYBACKSTATUS
	  not being set under certain circumstances. Fix a minor issue, to
	  make it use the filenames that were parsed, instead of the entire
	  argument string. Fix Background() to return -1 like Playback(),
	  if no args are specified.

2006-09-27 19:10 +0000 [r43783-43798]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* main/rtp.c: Compensate for out of order packets better if RFC2833
	  compensation is turned on.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Get rid of two functions from a time now
	  past (we THINK these are from pre-recursive lock time) that may
	  be contributing to two open issues on the bug tracker (7562/7939)
	  and that has the potential to just make bad things happen if the
	  timing is right.

2006-09-27 16:55 +0000 [r43779]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/channel.c,res/res_features.c: Fix a problem that occurred if
	  a user entered a digit
	  that matched a bridge feature that was configured using multiple
	  digits, and the digit that was pressed timed out in the feature
	  digit timeout period. For example, if blind transfer is
	  configured as '##', and a user presses just '#'. In this
	  situation, the call would lock up and no longer pass any frames.
	  (issue #7977 reported by festr, and issue #7982 reported by
	  michaels and valuable input provided by mneuhauser and kuj. Fixed
	  by me, with testing help and peer review from Joshua Colp). There
	  are a couple of issues involved in this fix: 1) When
	  ast_generic_bridge determines that there has been a timeout, it
	  returned AST_BRIDGE_RETRY. Then, when ast_channel_bridge gets
	  this result, it calls ast_generic_bridge over again with the same
	  timestamp for the next event. This results in an endless loop of
	  nothing until the call is terminated. This is resolved by simply
	  changing ast_generic_bridge to return AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE when it
	  sees a timeout. 2) I also changed ast_channel_bridge such that if
	  in the process of calculating the time until the next event, it
	  knows a timeout has already occured, to immediately return
	  AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE instead of attempting to bridge the channels
	  anyway. 3) In the process of testing the previous two changes, I
	  ran into a problem in res_features where ast_channel_bridge would
	  return because it determined that there was a timeout. However,
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features would then determine by its own
	  calculation that there was still 1 ms before the timeout really
	  occurs. It would then proceed, and since the bridge broke out and
	  did *not* return a frame, it interpreted this as the call was
	  over and hung up the channels. The reason for this was because
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features and ast_channel_bridge in
	  channel.c were using different times for their calculations.
	  channel.c uses the start_time on the bridge config, which is the
	  time that the feature digit was recieved. However, res_features
	  had another time, 'start', which was set right before calling
	  ast_channel_bridge. 'start' will always be slightly after
	  start_time in the bridge config, and sometimes enough to round up
	  to one ms. This is fixed by making ast_bridge_call use the same
	  time as ast_channel_bridge for the timeout calculation. ........

2006-09-27 16:24 +0000 [r43775]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/Makefile: removed the chan_misdn
	  versioning, since Asterisk has it's own

2006-09-27 16:23 +0000 [r43774]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make rfc2833compensate a global option.

2006-09-27 04:35 +0000 [r43756]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Backport revision 43754 from the trunk,
	  which removes an unused buffer from mm_login to close bug 8038,
	  as well as addresses some formatting and coding guidelines issues
	  in passing. Originally, I did not commit this to 1.4 since it is
	  not necessarily fixing a bug. However, since the IMAP storage
	  code is brand new, I decided it would be better to make the
	  change here as well, in case someone has to work on this code to
	  address issues in the very near future. I don't want to make
	  unnecessary merge problems going to the trunk.

2006-09-27 02:32 +0000 [r43739]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* configs/extensions.ael.sample: This change to extensions.ael was
	  to fix bug 8031; the install scripts are causing it to be copied
	  to /etc/asterisk/extensions.ael, and because it is a fairly
	  direct conversion of the original extensions.conf, the macro and
	  context names clash with the existing extensions.conf. So, I put
	  an ael- in front of all macros and contexts, and checked every
	  goto and macro call. Also, this file compiles under aelparse.

2006-09-26 20:56 +0000 [r43710]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/asterisk.c: Back in revision 4798, this message was changed from
	  using ast_cli() to directly calling write(). During this change,
	  checking if this was a remote console was removed. This caused
	  this message about using "exit" or "quit" to exit an Asterisk
	  console to come up in times where it did not make sense. This
	  change restores the check to see if this is a remote console
	  before printing the message. (fixes BE-65)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add missing newline character in the warning
	  message about deprecated TOS values in configuration.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: When parsing the sections of voicemail.conf that contain
	  mailbox definitions, don't introduce a length limit on the
	  definition by using a 256 byte temporary storage buffer. Instead,
	  make the temporary buffer just as big as it needs to be to hold
	  the entire mailbox definition. (fixes BE-68)

2006-09-26 20:19 +0000 [r43695-43697]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_local.c: Strip options off the argument passed for
	  devicestate in chan_local. (issue #8034 reported by pcardozo)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, main/channel.c, main/slinfactory.c: Slight
	  overhaul of the whisper support. 1. We need to duplicate the
	  frame from ast_translate 2. We need to ensure we always have
	  signed linear coming in for signed linear combining. 3. We need
	  to ensure we are always feeding signed linear out. 4. Properly
	  store and restore write format when beeping on the channel we are
	  whispering on. 5. Properly discontinue the stream on the channel
	  for the beep. (issue #8019 reported by timkelly1980)

	* doc/rtp-packetization.txt, main/frame.c: Issue #8015, patch by
	  Dan Austin. Maximum values were incorrect, which is why this is
	  being put in 1.4

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Add proper codec support to chan_skinny.
	  Works with at least ulaw, alaw, and g729a. This is technically a
	  "new feature", but there are justifications for it. I found a bug
	  with the recent rtp packetization changes, which caused the media
	  setup to fail under certain circumstances, particularly when
	  using allow=all, or having no allow= statements (globally or on
	  the device). I could have either removed the rtp packetization
	  features, or I could add proper codec support (which, without, I
	  think most people would consider to be a bug anyways).

	* channels/iax2-provision.c: Fix a CLI command registration issue
	  where an erroneous message claiming that "iax2 show provisioning"
	  was already registered. This was because this command was
	  registering itself as both the command, as well as the command it
	  is deprecating. (issue #8022, reported by bjweeks, fixed by
	  myself)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c:Check to see if the channel that is activating the
