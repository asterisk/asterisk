	* Asterisk 10.12.2-digiumphones Released.

	* AST-2013-002: Prevent denial of service in HTTP server

	  AST-2012-014, fixed in January of this year, contained a fix for
	  Asterisk's HTTP server for a remotely-triggered crash. While the fix
	  put in place fixed the possibility for the crash to be triggered, a
	  denial of service vector still exists with that solution if an
	  attacker sends one or more HTTP POST requests with very large
	  Content-Length values. This patch resolves this by capping the
	  Content-Length at 1024 bytes. Any attempt to send an HTTP POST
	  with Content-Length greater than this cap will not result in any
	  memory allocation. The POST will be responded to with an HTTP 413
	  "Request Entity Too Large" response.

	  This issue was reported by Christoph Hebeisen of TELUS Security Labs

	* AST-2013-003: Prevent username disclosure in SIP channel driver

	  When authenticating a SIP request with alwaysauthreject enabled,
	  allowguest disabled, and autocreatepeer disabled, Asterisk discloses
	  whether a user exists for INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and REGISTER transaction
	  in multiple ways. The information is disclosed when:
	  * A "407 Proxy Authentication Required" response is sent instead of a
	    "401 Unauthorized" response
	  * The presence or absence of additional tags occurs at the end of
	    "403 Forbidden" (such as "(Bad Auth)")
	  * A "401 Unauthorized" response is sent instead of "403 Forbidden"
	    response after a retransmission
	  * Retransmission are sent when a matching peer did not exist, but not
	    when a matching peer did exist.

	  This patch resolves these various vectors by ensuring that the
	  responses sent in all scenarios is the same, regardless of the presence
	  of a matching peer.

	  This issue was reported by Walter Doekes, OSSO B.V. A	substantial
	  portion of the testing and the solution to this problem was done by
	  Walter as well - a huge thanks to his tireless efforts in finding all
	  the ways in which this setting didn't work, providing automated tests,
	  and working with Kinsey on getting this fixed.

	* Asterisk 10.12.1-digiumphones Released.

	* Fix astcanary startup problem due to wrong pid value from before daemon
	  call

	  When Asterisk forks itself into the background via a call to daemon, it must
	  re-set the pid value of the new process. Otherwise, astcanary gets the pid
	  value of the process before the fork, which prevents it from running.
	  Asterisk eventually starts lowering its priority, as it can no longer
	  communicate with the proverbial canary in the coal mine.

	  This patch ensures that the correct process identifier is used by astcanary.

	* Update init.d scripts to handle stderr; readd splash screen for remote
	  consoles

	  When r376428 was commited to re-order start up sequences to be more tolerant
  	  of forking with thread primitives, a few items were changed that caused
	  changes in behavior on some distros. This includes:
	  
	  * Not displaying the splash screen on a remote console.
          * Displaying an error message on stderr when a remote console cannot
            connect to a running instance of Asterisk.

          In the first case, the splash screen was re-added (thanks to Michael L.
          Young).
          In the second case, the various init.d scripts were modified to pipe
          stderr to /dev/null, as the error message is useful - if you execute a
	  remote console or a remote console command execution and it fail, it
	  should tell you. Note that the error message was always present, it just
	  failed to be printed prior to r376428.

          Much thanks to the folks who quickly reported this problem, provided
          solutions, and promptly tested the various init.d scripts on a variety of
	  distros.

	* Reset RTP timestamp; sequence number on SSRC change

	  In r370252 for ASTERISK-18404, Asterisk's handling of RTP was
	  modified to better account for out of order RTP packets. This was
	  accomplished by using the RTP timestamp and sequence number to check
	  for out of order packets. However, when a SSRC change occurs, the
	  timestamp and sequence number will no longer have any relation to the
	  previously received packets. The variables tracking the timestamp and
	  sequence number therefore have to be reset.

	  | 30 lines Resolve crashes due to large stack allocations when
	  using TCP Asterisk had several places where messages received

	  allocations that overflow the stack. This patch modifies those
	  portions of Asterisk using TCP to either favor heap allocations

	  * For SIP, the allocation now has an upper limit * For HTTP, the
	  allocation is now a heap allocation instead of a stack allocation
	  * For XMPP (in res_jabber), the allocation has been eliminated

	  through exploitation of event cache Asterisk maintains an
	  internal cache for devices in the event subsystem. The device
	  state cache holds the state of each device known to Asterisk,
	  such that consumers of device state information can query for the
	  last known state for a particular device, even if it is not part
	  of an active call. The concept of a device in Asterisk can
	  include entities that do not have a physical representation. One
	  way that this occurred was when anonymous calls are allowed in
	  Asterisk. A device was automatically created and stored in the
	  cache for each anonymous call that occurred; this was possible in
	  the SIP and IAX2 channel drivers and through channel drivers that
	  utilized the res_jabber/res_xmpp resource modules (Gtalk, Jingle,
	  and Motif). These devices are never removed from the system,
	  allowing anonymous calls to potentially exhaust a system's
	  resources. This patch changes the event cache subsystem and
	  device state management to no longer cache devices that are not
	  associated with a physical entity. (issue ASTERISK-20175)

	  lines codec_dahdi: Fix output of "transcoder show" CLI command.
	  In r306010 "Asterisk media architecture conversion - no more
	  format bitfields", the logic for incrementing encoders and
	  decoders when opening transcoder channels was changed without
	  making the corresponding change when decrementing encoder /
	  decoder channels. The result being that when a channel was
	  destroyed, codec_dahdi couldn't properly tell if it was an
	  encoder or decoder, and the default case is to assume it was a
	  decoder. This could result in negative numbers for decoders in
	  use like in: VOIP6*CLI> transcoder show 2/-2 encoders/decoders of
	  92 channels are in use. (closes issue ASTERISK-19921) Patch-by:

	  The most common place to see the crash occur was when attempting

	  (Tue, 27 Nov 2012) | 33 lines Fix extension matching with the '-'
	  char. The '-' char is supposed to be ignored by the dialplan
	  extension matching. Unfortunately, it's treatment is not handled
	  consistently throughout the extension matching code. * Made the
	  old exten matching code consistently ignore '-' chars. * Made the
	  old exten matching code consistently handle case in the matching.
	  * Made ignore empty character sets. * Fixed ast_extension_cmp()
	  to return -1, 0, or 1 as documented. The only user of it in
	  pbx_lua.c was testing for -1. It was originally returning the
	  strcmp() value for less than which is not usually going to be -1.
	  * Fix character set sorting if the sets have the same number of
	  characters and start with the same character. Character set [0-9]
	  now sorts before [02-9a] as originally intended. * Updated some
	  extension label and priority already in use warnings to also
	  indicate if the extension is aliased. (closes issue

	  (Thu, 22 Nov 2012) | 23 lines Re-initialize logmsgs mutex upon
	  logger initialization to prevent lock errors Similar to the patch
	  that moved the fork earlier in the startup sequence to prevent
	  mutex errors in the recursive mutex surrounding the read/write
	  thread registration lock, this patch re-initializes the logmsgs
	  mutex. Part of the start up sequence before forking the process
	  into the background includes reading asterisk.conf; this has to
	  occur prior to the call to daemon in order to read startup
	  parameters. When reading in a conf file, log statements can be
	  generated. Since this can't be avoided, the mutex instead is
	  re-initialized to ensure a reset of any thread tracking
	  information. This patch also includes some additional debugging
	  to catch errors when locking or unlocking the recursive mutex
	  that surrounds locks when the DEBUG_THREADS build option is
	  enabled. DO_CRASH or THREAD_CRASH will cause an abort() if a
	  mutex error is detected. (issue ASTERISK-19463) Reported by:

	  (Sun, 18 Nov 2012) | 49 lines Reorder startup sequence to prevent
	  lockups when process is sent to background Although it is very
	  rare and timing dependent, the potential exists for the call to
	  'daemon' to cause what appears to be a deadlock in Asterisk
	  during startup. This can occur when a recursive mutex is obtained
	  prior to the daemon call executing. Since daemon uses fork to
	  send the process into the background, any threading primitives
	  are unsafe to re-use after the call. Implementations of pthread
	  recursive mutexes are highly likely to store the thread
	  identifier of the thread that previously obtained the mutex. If
	  the mutex was locked prior to the fork, a subsequent unlock
	  operation will potentially fail as the thread identifier is no
	  longer valid. Since the mutex is still locked, all subsequent
	  attempts to grab the mutex by other threads will block. This
	  behavior exhibited itself most often when DEBUG_THREADS was
	  enabled, as this compile time option surrounds the mutexes in
	  Asterisk with another recursive mutex that protects the storage
	  of thread related information. This made it much more likely that
	  a recursive mutex would be obtained prior to daemon and unlocked
	  after the call. This patch does the following: a) It backports a
	  patch from Asterisk 11 that prevents the spawning of the
	  localtime monitoring thread. This thread is now spawned after
	  Asterisk has fully booted. b) It re-orders the startup sequence
	  to call daemon earlier during Asterisk startup. This limits the
	  potential of threading primitives being accessed by
	  initialization calls before daemon is called. c) It removes calls
	  to ast_verbose/ast_log/etc. prior to daemon being called.
	  Developers should send error messages directly to stderr prior to
	  daemon, as calls to ast_log may access recursive mutexes that
	  store thread related information. d) It reorganizes when thread
	  local storage is created for storing lock information during the
	  creation of threads. Prior to this patch, the read/write lock
	  protecting the list of threads in ast_register_thread would
	  utilize the lock in the thread local storage prior to it being
	  initialized; this patch prevents that. On a very related note,
	  this patch will *greatly* improve the stability of the Asterisk
	  Test Suite. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2197

	  07 Nov 2012) | 30 lines Fix misuses of timeouts throughout the
	  code. Prior to this change, a common method for determining if a
	  timeout was reached was to call a function such as
	  ast_waitfor_n() and inspect the out parameter that told how many
	  milliseconds were left, then use that as the input to
	  ast_waitfor_n() on the next go-around. The problem with this is
	  that in some cases, submillisecond timeouts can occur, resulting
	  in the out parameter not decreasing any. When this happens
	  thousands of times, the result is that the timeout takes much
	  longer than intended to be reached. As an example, I had a
	  situation where a 3 second timeout took multiple days to finally
	  end since most wakeups from ast_waitfor_n() were under a
	  millisecond. This patch seeks to fix this pattern throughout the
	  code. Now we log the time when an operation began and find the
	  difference in wall clock time between now and when the event
	  started. This means that sub-millisecond timeouts now cannot play
	  havoc when trying to determine if something has timed out. Part
	  of this fix also includes changing the function ast_waitfor() so
	  that it is possible for it to return less than zero when a
	  negative timeout is given to it. This makes it actually possible
	  to detect errors in ast_waitfor() when there is no timeout.

	* Fix a SIP request memory leak with TLS connections.

	During the TLS re-work in chan_sip some TLS specific code was moved
	into a separate function. This function operates on a copy of the
	incoming SIP request. This copy was never deinitialized causing a
	memory leak for each request processed.

	This function is now given a SIP request structure which it can use
	to copy the incoming request into. This reduces the amount of memory
	allocations done since the internal allocated components are reused
	between packets and also ensures the SIP request structure is
	deinitialized when the TLS connection is torn down.

	  (Mon, 05 Nov 2012) | 28 lines Refactor ast_timer_ack to return an
	  error and handle the error in timer users Currently, if an
	  acknowledgement of a timer fails Asterisk will not realize that a
	  serious error occurred and will continue attempting to use the
	  timer's file descriptor. This can lead to situations where errors
	  stream to the CLI/log file. This consumes significant resources,
	  masks the actual problem that occurred (whatever caused the timer
	  to fail in the first place), and can leave channels in odd
	  states. This patch propagates the errors in the timing resource
	  modules up through the timer core, and makes users of these
	  timers handle acknowledgement failures. It also adds some
	  defensive coding around the use of timers to prevent using bad
	  file descriptors in off nominal code paths. Note that the patch
	  created by the issue reporter was modified slightly for this
	  commit and backported to 1.8, as it was originally written for
	  Asterisk 10. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2178/

	  chan_misdn: Fix loss of B channels if L1 is down. If you make 2
	  calls out an NT PTMP port which is not connected to any phone,
	  the B channel associated with that call becomes unusable until
	  Asterisk is restarted. The problem is the EVENT_SETUP is queued
	  when L1 is not up in misdn_lib_send_event(). If L1 cannot be
	  activated the event won't be dequeued. It gets even worse when
	  the call is hung up. The queued EVENT_SETUP will be overwritten
	  by an EVENT_DISCONNECT. The reserved B channel then will never be
	  freed. If later someone connects a phone to the port, L1 will
	  eventually activate and the queued EVENT_DISCONNECT is sent down
	  the stack. However, it is ignored because it is the wrong call
	  state. The real fix would be that activation and queueing for a
	  new SETUP is done by the NT stack. But since it doesn't, the
	  workaround must be removed because it doesn't always work. Fix:
	  The event is no longer queued but immediately sent to the stack.
	  If L1 cannot be activated, the L3 state machine that was started
	  by the EVENT_SETUP will do its work, i.e. a timeout will release
	  the B channel properly. The SETUP possibly cannot be sent the
	  first time but is resent by T303 in case L1 could be activated.

	  (Fri, 12 Oct 2012) | 28 lines Do not use a FILE handle when doing
	  SIP TCP reads. This is used to solve an issue where a poll on a
	  file descriptor does not necessarily correspond to the readiness
	  of a FILE handle to be read. This change makes it so that for TCP
	  connections, we do a recv() on the file descriptor instead.
	  Because TCP does not guarantee that an entire message or even
	  just one single message will arrive during a read, a loop has
	  been introduced to ensure that we only attempt to handle a single
	  message at a time. The tcptls_session_instance structure has also
	  had an overflow buffer added to it so that if more than one TCP
	  message arrives in one go, there is a place to throw the excess.
	  Huge thanks goes out to Walter Doekes for doing extensive review
	  on this change and finding edge cases where code could fail.

	  (Thu, 11 Oct 2012) | 29 lines Fix incorrect billing duration
	  reported when batch mode is enabled Similar to r369351, the
	  billing duration can be skewed when batch mode is enabled. This
	  happened much more rarely than the duration, as it only occured
	  when the call was answered (thereby indicating an actual answer
	  time) and immediately hung up on (indicating a billsec of 0).
	  Since a billing time of '0' can either mean that the call
	  immediately ended or that the CDR was improperly answered, we
	  have to use additional information to know whether or not we can
	  trust the CDR billsec value. Prior to this patch, we looked to
	  see if we had a valid answer time. If we did, and billsec was
	  zero, we used the current time to calculate what billsec value we
	  could from the CDR being written. If batch mode is enabled, this
	  will incorrectly report a billsec value being much greater than
	  the actual duration of the call. Instead of relying on the
	  presence of an answer time to know whether or not we can
	  re-calculate the billsec for the CDR, we now also use the
	  presence of the CDR's end time to know if we need to re-calculate
	  or whether we can trust the billsec value that we have. This
	  prevents erroneous jumps in the billsec value, while still making
	  sure that in the worst case, some billing time will be
	  calculated. (closes issue AST-1016) Reported by: Thomas Arimont

	  Oct 2012) | 46 lines Resolve issues in ConfBridge regarding
	  marked, waitmarked, and unmarked users Thank's to Neil Tallim
	  (flan)'s tireless testing, issue reporting, and patches it became
	  clear that app_confbridge had some complex logic in how it
	  handled interactions between marked, waitmarked, and unmarked
	  users. In particular, there were some areas in which the
	  interactions between the users resulted in inconsistent behavior,
	  and app_confbridge was missing logic in how to handle some corner
	  cases. Some areas included: * Poor handling of mixing unmarked
	  and waitmarked users * Inconsistencies in how MOH and muting was
	  applied to various users * Handling of various announcements for
	  different user profile options flan's patches seem to fix the
	  various issues, but highlighted how hard the code could be to
	  maintain. In an attempt to make things easier to maintain and to
	  more fully enumerate the various cases that exist, this patch
	  breaks up the logic into a state machine-like setup. Please note
	  that the various state transitioned are documented on the
	  Asterisk wiki:

	  22 lines Improve AMI long line error handling In AMI's parser,
	  when it receives a long line (> 1024 characters), it discards
	  that line, but continues to process the message normally.
	  Typically, this is not a problem because a) who has lines that
	  long and b) usually a discarded line results in an invalid
	  message. But if that line is specifying an optional field, then
	  the message will be processed, you get a 'Response: Success', but
	  things don't work the way you expected them to. This patch
	  changes the behavior when a line-too-long parse error occurs. *
	  Changes the log message to avoid way-too-long (and truncated
	  anyways) log messages * Adds a 'parsing' status flag to Response:
	  Success * Sets parsing = MESSAGE_LINE_TOO_LONG if, well, a line
	  is too long * Responds with an appropriate error if parsing !=

	  (including 0 for deleting nothing). * Changed some poorly named

	  (Wed, 03 Oct 2012) | 31 lines Check for presence of buddy in
	  info/dinfo handlers The res_jabber resource module uses the
	  ASTOBJ library for managing its ref counted objects. After
	  calling ASTOBJ_CONTAINER_FIND to locate a buddy object, the
	  pointer to the object has to be checked to see if the buddy
	  existed. Prior to this patch, the buddy object was not checked
	  for NULL; with this patch in both aji_client_info_handler and
	  aji_dinfo_handler the pointer is checked before used and, if no
	  buddy object was found, the handlers return an error code. This
	  patch does not take the approach that our JID can be used to log
	  in from another resource. If that approach is desired, an
	  improvement could be made to this patch to create the buddy on
	  the fly. This patch seeks only to prevent Asterisk from crashing.
	  Note that multiple people have proposed patches for this issue;
	  the patch being committed here is based on those. (closes issue

	  long member lists. Greenlight in #asterisk brought up that he was
	  receiving an error message "Could not create persistent member
	  string, out of space" when running app_queue in Asterisk 10.
	  dump_queue_members() made an assumption that 8K would be enough
	  to store the generated string, but with queues that have large
	  member lists this is not always the case. This patch removes the
	  limitation and uses ast_str instead of a fixed sized buffer. The
	  complicating factor comes from the fact that ast_db_get requires
	  a buffer and buffer size argument, which doesn't let us pull back
	  more than what we pass in, so I introduced a new
	  ast_db_get_allocated() which returns an ast_strdup()'d copy of
	  the value from astdb. As an aside, I did some testing on the
	  maximum size of data that we can store in the BDB library we

	  properly initialized. If an Asterisk module specifies a
	  dependency in ast_module_info.nonoptreq, it is possible for
	  Asterisk to skip calling the modules's .load function. Asterisk
	  was loading and linking the module via load_dynamic_module() but
	  was not adding the module to the resource_heap. Therefore the
	  module was not initialized based on it's priority along with the
	  other modules in the heap. Now use load_resource() instead of
	  load_dynamic_module() for non-optional requirement. This will add
	  the module to the resource_heap so the module can be properly
	  initialized in the correct order. This is required if there are
	  any module global data structures initialized in the .load()
	  callback for the module on platforms which do not support weak
	  references. (issue ASTERISK-20439) Reported by: sruffell Patches:

	  write function. This is incorrect as any non-zero value returned
	  is considered a failure while a return value of 0 is success. For
	  callers (such as ast_streamfile) that checked the return value
	  they would have considered it a failure when in reality nothing
	  went wrong and it was actually a success. The write function for

	* /: reenable automerge

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a deadlock caused by a race condition
	  between removing a hint and reloading the dialplan and
	  subscribing to the removed hint. If conditions were right it was
	  possible for both the PBX core and chan_sip to deadlock by both
	  having a lock that the other wants. In the case of the PBX core
	  it had the contexts lock and wanted a SIP dialog lock, while in
	  the case of chan_sip it had the SIP dialog lock and wanted the
	  contexts lock. This fix unlocks the SIP dialog before getting the
	  extension state so that the other thread will not block on trying
	  to lock it. Once the extension state is retrieved the SIP dialog
	  is locked again and life carries on. As the SIP dialog is
	  reference counted it is not possible for it to go away after
	  unlocking. (closes issue ASTERISK-20437) Reported by: jhutchins

	  reference count decrementing and sometimes premature destruction.
	  When using the 'e' or 'E' option to MeetMe the configured

	  empty. If no conference bridges are empty the caller is prompted
	  to enter the number of one. This operation left around a pointer
	  to the last created conference bridge still containing
	  participants. When the caller that was not able to find any empty
	  conference bridge hung up this pointer was disposed of and the
	  reference count of the conference bridge decremented. If there
	  was only a single participant in the conference bridge it was
	  ultimately destroyed prematurely. (closes issue AST-994) Reported

	  initialization and TLS client connections This patch resolves two
	  sources of memory leaks when using TLS in Asterisk: 1) It removes
	  improper initialization (and multiple re-initializations) of
	  portions of the SSL library. Asterisk calls SSL_library_init and
	  SSL_load_error_strings during SSL initialization; collectively
	  this obviates the need for calling any of the following during
	  initialization or client connection handling: *
	  ERR_load_crypto_strings (handled by SSL_load_error_strings) *
	  OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms (synonym for SSL_library_init) *
	  SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms (synonym for SSL_library_init) 2)
	  Failure to completely clean up all memory allocated by Asterisk
	  and by the SSL library for TLS clients. This included not freeing
	  the SSL_CTX object in the SIP channel driver, as well as not
	  clearing the error stack when the TLS client exited. Note that
	  these memory leaks were found by Thomas Arimont, and this patch
	  was essentially written by him with some minor tweaks. (closes

	  session when the crypto keys changed. In certain circumstances -
	  most notably when a phone is put on hold after having been
	  bridged for a significant amount of time - the act of re-creating
	  the SRTP session causes problems for certain models of phones.
	  The patch committed in r356604 always re-created the SRTP session
	  regardless of whether or not the cryptographic keys changed.
	  Since this is technically not necessary, this patch modifies the
	  behavior to only re-create the SRTP session if Asterisk detects
	  that the remote key has changed. This allows models of phones
	  that do not handle the SRTP session changing to continue to work,
	  while also providing the behavior needed for those phones that do

	  when parking a call for the second time. Using the AMI redirect
	  action to take an ISDN call out of a parking lot causes the MOH

	  post an AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD unconditionally when it redirects a

	  peer PBX1 has two peers that are its neighbors, PBX2 and PBX3,
	  and where PBX2 and PBX3 are also neighbors. If the connection is
	  temporarily broken between PBX1 and PBX3, PBX1 should not include
	  PBX3 in the list of peers it sends to PBX2 in a DPDISCOVER
	  message, as it cannot send messages to PBX3. If it does, PBX2
	  will assume that PBX3 already received the message and fail to
	  forward the message on to PBX3 itself. This patch fixes this by
	  only including peers in a DPDISCOVER message that are reachable
	  by the sending node. This includes all peers with an empty
	  address (00:00:00:00:00:00) and that are have been reached by a

	  The inboxcount2 function uses find_user in such a fashion when
	  counting new messages, and fails to free the resulting voicemail
	  user object. 2. When populate_defaults is called on a voicemail
	  user, it wipes whatever flags have been set on the object by
	  copying over the global flags object. If the VM_ALLOCED flag was
	  ste on the voicemail user prior to doing so, that flag is

	  (Thu, 30 Aug 2012) | 36 lines AST-2012-012: Resolve AMI User
	  Unauthorized Shell Access through ExternalIVR The AMI Originate
	  action can allow a remote user to specify information that can be
	  used to execute shell commands on the system hosting Asterisk.
	  This can result in an unwanted escalation of permissions, as the
	  Originate action, which requires the "originate" class
	  authorization, can be used to perform actions that would
	  typically require the "system" class authorization. Previous
	  attempts to prevent this permission escalation (AST-2011-006,
	  AST-2012-004) have sought to do so by inspecting the names of
	  applications and functions passed in with the Originate action
	  and, if those applications/functions matched a predefined set of
	  values, rejecting the command if the user lacked the "system"
	  class authorization. As reported by IBM X-Force Research, the
	  "ExternalIVR" application is not listed in the predefined set of
	  values. The solution for this particular vulnerability is to
	  include the "ExternalIVR" application in the set of defined
	  applications/functions that require "system" class authorization.
	  Unfortunately, the approach of inspecting fields in the Originate
	  action against known applications/functions has a significant
	  flaw. The predefined set of values can be bypassed by creative
	  use of the Originate action or by certain dialplan
	  configurations, which is beyond the ability of Asterisk to
	  analyze at run-time. Attempting to work around these scenarios
	  would result in severely restricting the applications or
	  functions and prevent their usage for legitimate means. As such,
	  any additional security vulnerabilities, where an
	  application/function that would normally require the "system"
	  class authorization can be executed by users with the "originate"
	  class authorization, will not be addressed. Instead, the
	  README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file has been updated to
	  reflect that the AMI Originate action can result in commands
	  requiring the "system" class authorization to be executed. Proper
	  system configuration can limit the impact of such scenarios.

	  in code such that if there were no members found in the backend,

	  this only affected static queues with realtime members. Realtime

	  Walter Doekes (referenced lower in the commit message) The main
	  fix here is to treat the IPorHost portion of the dial string as a
	  temporary outbound proxy. This ensures requests get sent to the
	  proper location. Due to the age of the request, some parts were
	  no longer relevant. For instance, the request moved outbound
	  proxy parsing code into a single method. This is done in a
	  previous commit, so it was not necessary to do again. Also, the
	  review request fixed some errors with regards to request routing
	  for CANCEL and ACK requests. This has also been fixed in more

	  (Tue, 31 Jul 2012) | 34 lines Help mitigate potential reinvite
	  glare scenarios. When Asterisk servers are set up back-to-back,
	  and direct media is to be used betweeen endpoints, it is fairly
	  common for the two Asterisk servers to send direct media
	  reinvites to each other simultaneously. This results in 491s and
	  ACKs being exchanged between the servers. While the media
	  eventually gets set up properly, the problem is that there can be
	  a noticeable delay for the streams to stabilize. This patch adds
	  a new directmedia option called "outgoing". With this set, an
	  immediate direct media reinvite will only be sent if the call
	  direction is outgoing. For incoming dialogs, an immediate direct
	  media reinvite will not be sent, but further "reactionary" direct
	  media reinvites may be sent. For those who are having some deja
	  vu, that's because this patch was originally committed to trunk
	  since there is a new configuration option added. After seeing a
	  bug report about audio being slow to set up on SIP calls, it
	  became apparent that this patch would be the best solution for
	  resolving the issue. The patch is unintrusive and will have no
	  effect unless the option is explicitly enabled. (closes issue

	* r372710: Only re-create an SRTP session when needed; respond with
	  correct crypto policy

	  In r356604, SRTP handling was fixed to accomodate multiple crypto
	  keys in an SDP offer and the ability to re-create an SRTP session
	  when the crypto keys changed. In certain circumstances - most
	  notably when a phone is put on hold after having been bridged for a
	  significant amount of time - the act of re-creating the SRTP session
	  causes problems for certain models of	phones.	The patch committed in
	  r356604 always re-created the SRTP session regardless	of whether or
	  not the cryptographic keys changed. Since this is technically
	  not necessary, this patch modifies the behavior to only re-create the
	  SRTP session if Asterisk detects that the remote key has changed.
	  This allows models of phones that do not handle the SRTP session
	  changing to continue to work, while also providing the behavior
	  needed for those phones that do re-negotiate cryptographic keys.

	* r372841: Fix bad channel application data reference.

	  When channels get bridged due to an AMI bridge action
	  or a DTMF attended transfer, the two channels that
	  get bridged have their application data pointing to
	  the other channel's name. This means that if one channel
	  is hung up but the other moves on, it means that the
	  channel that moves on will have its application data
	  pointing at freed memory.

	  (Thu, 19 Jul 2012) | 49 lines Handle extremely out of order RFC
	  2833 DTMF The current implementation of RFC 2833 DTMF handling in
	  res_rtp_asterisk will, if a packet arrives out of order, drop the
	  packet. This is to prevent duplicate ton generation in the
	  Asterisk core. Since the RTP layer does not buffer data itself,
	  this is the only option the RTP layer currently has for handling
	  packets that arrive out of order. For the most part, this doesn't
	  matter. For a particular digit, so long as a BEGIN packet arrives
	  before the first END packet, the digit will be produced. If
	  subsequent BEGIN packets arrive interleaved with the ENDs, they
	  will be dropped; likewise, if the BEGIN or END packets themselves
	  are out of order, those packets are dropped but sufficient
	  information is conveyed to the Asterisk core to produce the
	  appropriate digit. For certain sequences of DTMF packets - most
	  notably when, for a particular digit, an END packet arrives
	  before any BEGIN packet for that digit - this is a real problem.
	  When an END arrives before any BEGINs, the END packet is dropped
	  - but at the same time, it causes subsequent BEGIN packets for
	  that digit to be ignored. When the next in order END packet
	  arrives, it too is dropped - Asterisk believes that there was no
	  initial BEGIN. The solution this patch provides is to trust the
	  END packet to convey the information needed for the Asterisk core
	  to produce the DTMF digit. If we receive an END packet, and it: *
	  Has a timestamp greater then the last timestamp received from an
	  END packet * Does not have the same sequence number as the last
	  received sequence number (and is thus not an END packet
	  retransmission) Then we send the END frame up to the Asterisk
	  core. It contains enough DTMF information for Asterisk to produce
	  the digit. On the other hand, if we receive a BEGIN or
	  continuation packet that occurs with a timestamp equal to or less
	  then the last END timestamp, then we've received something out of
	  order - but we already have received enough information to
	  produce the digit. These packets are dropped. Much thanks goes to
	  Olle Johansson (oej) for providing the idea for this solution.

	  in r354890 and a fix for an invalid free in r356797. This could
	  result in accessing and writing into freed memory. The allocation
	  for these arrays has been reworked to avoid the possibility of
	  invalid frees, access of freed memory, and crashes that were
	  occurring as a result of this. Locking around accesses and
	  modifications of the voicemail state structure members
	  dh_arraysize, heard, and deleted has been added to prevent
	  simultaneous modification and access when IMAP storage is in use.
	  If IMAP storage is not in use, this locking is not compiled in.

	  (Mon, 25 Jun 2012) | 29 lines Fix incorrect duration reporting in
	  CDRs created in batch mode Certain places in core/cdr.c would, if
	  the duration value were 0, calculate the duration as being the
	  delta between the current time and the time at which the CDR
	  record was started. While this does not typically cause a problem
	  in non-batch mode, this can cause an issue in batch mode where
	  CDR records are gathered and written long after those calls have
	  ended. In particular, this affects calls that were never
	  answered, as those are expected to have a duration of 0. Often,
	  this would result in CDR logs with a significant number of calls
	  with lengthy durations, but dispositions of "BUSY". Note that
	  this does not affect cdr_csv, as that backend does not use
	  ast_cdr_getvar and instead directly reports the duration value.
	  The affected core backends include cdr_apative_odbc and
	  cdr_custom; other extended or deprecated CDR backends may

	* Fix request routing issue when outboundproxy is used

	  Asterisk was incorrectly setting the destination of CANCELs and ACKs
	  for error responses to the URI of the initial INVITE.  This resulted
	  in further requests, such as INVITEs with authentication
	  credentials, to be routed incorrectly.  Instead when these CANCEL or
	  ACKs are to be esnt, we should simply keep the destination the same
	  as what it previously was.  There is no need to alter it any.

	* /: Update merge property info

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix deadlock in SIP transfers that involve a
	  REFER request In r367163, "send to voicemail" functionality was
	  added to the SIP channel driver. This required updating the party
	  redirecting information for the channel based on the headers
	  provided in the REFER request. When the redirecting party
	  information is updated on the channel, a call to
	  ast_indicate_data occurs. Because handle_request_refer still had
	  the sip_pvt locked, a deadlock could occur between the pbx_thread
	  and the do_monitor thread servicing the REFER request. This patch
	  preserves the proper locking order between the channel and the
	  sip_pvt by ensuring that the sip_pvt is unlocked prior to
	  updating the party redirecting information on the channel.

	  r368629 | mmichelson | 2012-06-06 14:18:20 -0500 (Wed, 06 Jun
	  2012) | 31 lines Fix a specific scenario where ACKs are not
	  matched. If a dialog-starting INVITE contains a to-tag, then
	  Asterisk will respond with a 481. In this case, the resulting
	  incoming ACK would not be matched, so Asterisk would continue
	  retransmitting the 481 until the transaction times out. There
	  were two issues. Asterisk, upon creating a sip_pvt would generate
	  a local tag. However, when the time came to transmit the 481,
	  since there was a to-tag in the INVITE, Asterisk would place this
	  original to-tag in the 481 response. When the ACK came in,
	  Asterisk would attempt to match the to-tag in the ACK to the
	  generated local tag. Unfortunately, Asterisk never actually
	  transmitted a response with the generated local tag, so the
	  to-tag in the ACK would not match. The other problem was that
	  when the 481 was sent, nothing was set on the sip_pvt to indicate
	  what CSeq is expected in the ACK. To fix the first problem, we
	  zero out the to-tag seen in the incoming INVITE. This way,
	  Asterisk, when time to send a response, will send its generated
	  local tag instead. To fix the second problem, we set the
	  sip_pvt's pendinginvite to the CSeq of the INVITE when we send a
	  481. (closes issue ASTERISK-19892) Reported by Mark Michelson

	  2012) | 29 lines Prevent sip_pvt refleak when an ast_channel
	  outlasts its corresponding sip_pvt. chan_sip was coded under the
	  assumption that a SIP dialog with an owner channel will always be
	  destroyed after the owner channel has been hung up. However,
	  there are situations where the SIP dialog can time out and auto
	  destruct before the corresponding channel has hung up. A typical
	  example of this would be if the 'h' extension in the dialplan
	  takes a long time to complete. In such cases,
	  __sip_autodestruct() would complain about the dialog being auto
	  destroyed with an owner channel still in place. The problem is
	  that even once the owner channel was hung up, the sip_pvt would
	  still be linked in its ao2_container because nothing would ever
	  unlink it. The fix for this is that if __sip_autodestruct() is
	  called for a sip_pvt that still has an owner channel in place,
	  the destruction is rescheduled for 10 seconds in the future. This
	  will continue until the owner channel is finally hung up. (closes

	  that dbuf has enough data to finish filling up the output buffer.
	  The patch also makes sure that the dbuf state gets reset after we
	  know we read everything out of it already. In passing, this patch
	  includes some other cleanups of this module, including stripping
	  trailing whitespace, formatting fixes based on coding guidelines,
	  and removing a number of unused members from the private state

	  make a long story short, reinvite glares were broken because
	  Asterisk would invert the To and From headers when ACKing a 491
	  response. The reason was because the initreq of the dialog was
	  being changed to the incoming glared reinvite instead of being
	  set to the outgoing glared reinvite. This change has three parts
	  * In handle_incoming, we never will reject an ACK because it has
	  a to-tag present, even if we think the request may be out of
	  dialog. * In handle_request_invite, we do not change the initreq
	  when receiving a reinvite to which we will respond with a 491. *

	  free the ast_dial object if the requested channel technology
	  cannot be appended to the dialing structure * app_queue: if a
	  penalty rule failed to match any existing rule list names, the
	  created rule would not be inserted and its memory would be leaked
	  * app_read: dispose of the created silence detector in the
	  presence of off nominal circumstances * app_voicemail: dispose of
	  an allocated unique ID field for MWI event un-subscribe requests
	  in off nominal paths; dispose of configuration objects when using
	  the secret.conf option * chan_dahdi: dispose of the allocated
	  frame produced by ast_dsp_process * chan_iax2: properly unref
	  peer in CLI command "iax2 unregister" * chan_sip: dispose of the
	  allocated frame produced by sip_rtp_read's call of
	  ast_dsp_process; free memory in parse unit tests *
	  func_dialgroup: properly deref ao2 object grhead in nominal path
	  of dialgroup_read * func_odbc: free resultset in off nominal
	  paths of odbc_read * cli: free match_list in off nominal paths of
	  CLI match completion * config: free comment_buffer/list_buffer
	  when configuration file load is unchanged; free the same buffers
	  any time they were created and config files were processed *
	  data: free XML nodes in various places * enum: free context
	  buffer in off nominal paths * features: free ast_call_feature in
	  off nominal paths of applicationmap config processing * netsock2:
	  users of ast_sockaddr_resolve pass in an ast_sockaddr struct that
	  is allocated by the method. Failures in ast_sockaddr_resolve
	  could result in the users of the method not knowing whether or
	  not the buffer was allocated. The method will now not allocate
	  the ast_sockaddr struct if it will return failure. * pbx: cleanup
	  hash table traversals in off nominal paths; free ignore pattern
	  buffer if it already exists for the specified context * xmldoc:
	  cleanup various nodes when we no longer need them *
	  main/editline: various cleanup of pointers not being freed before
	  being assigned to other memory, cleanup along off nominal paths *
	  menuselect/mxml: cleanup of value buffer for an attribute when
	  that attribute did not specify a value * res_calendar*: responses
	  are allocated via the various *_request method returns and should
	  not be allocated in the various write_event methods; ensure
	  attendee buffer is freed if no data exists in the parsed node;
	  ensure that calendar objects are de-ref'd appropriately *

	  close the DIR* object in off nominal paths * res_rtp_asterisk: if
	  we run out of ports, close the rtp socket object and free the rtp

	  can take its place. 2. A companion to ast_ssl_setup() called

	  patch fixes to situations that could cause the CEL LINKEDID_END
	  event to be missed. 1) During a core stop gracefully, modules are
	  unloaded when ast_active_channels == 0. The LINKDEDID_END event
	  fires during the channel destructor. This means that
	  occasionally, the cel_* module will be unloaded before the
	  channel is destroyed. It seemed generally useful to wait until
	  the refcount of all channels == 0 before unloading, so I added a
	  channel counter and used it in the shutdown code. 2) During a
	  masquerade, ast_channel_change_linkedid is called. It calls
	  ast_cel_check_retire_linkedid which unrefs the linkedid in the
	  linkedids container in cel.c. It didn't ref the new linkedid. Now
	  it does. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1900/

	  | 26 lines Re-add LastMsgsSent value for SIP peers Previously,
	  MWI logic utilized a counter called 'lastmsgssent' to know
	  whether or not MWI NOTIFY requests had been sent to a specific
	  peer. When MWI notifications were changed to use the internal
	  event framework, this value was no longer needed for its original
	  purpose. Hence, it was no longer updated with the new/old message
	  counts for a peer. The value was previously removed for Asterisk
	  10; however, since it was still present in Asterisk 1.8 and still
	  useful for reporting purposes, it was decided to re-add the
	  value. This patch re-adds the 'LastMsgsSent' field in the
	  response to an AMI/CLI 'sip show peer [peer]' command, and makes
	  it so that the value of lastmsgssent is updated appropriately.
	  The value should now display the new/old message counts for a

	  behavior, such that if a sound file does not exist we do not
	  attempt to play it, but we only attempt that check if the a sound
	  file was specified in the first place. If a sound file was not
	  specified, we use the 'play number' logic in the helper function.

	* /, build_tools/make_version: Add feature modifier to versions
	  produced from branches Certain branches, such as Certified
	  Asterisk, may have a modifier added to them that specifies the
	  features available in that branch. For branches, this modifier is
	  expected to be reflected in the location of the branch in
	  subversion. For example, a subversion of URL of
	  /certified/branches/1.8.11 would have a feature modifier of
	  'certified'. This is slightly different then how features are
	  determined for tags, where the feature is part of the actual tag
	  name, e.g., "10.5.0-digiumphones". In keeping with the
	  nomenclature used for tags, the feature specifier for branches is
	  translated and placed after the revision numbers. For the example
	  given previously, this would result in a branch version of
	  "Asterisk SVN-branch-1.8.11-cert-rXXXXXX".

	  functionality to Asterisk. This change accommodates two methods
	  by which calls can be directed to a user's voicemail. * Incoming
	  calls can be redirected to any user's voicemail. * Established
	  calls can be blind transferred to any user's voicemail. Digium
	  phones indicate the desire to direct a call to voicemail by using
	  a Diversion header with a reason parameter of "send_to_vm". This
	  patch adds the "send_to_vm" reason as a valid redirecting reason.
	  In addition, chan_sip.c has been modified to update redirecting
	  information on the transferred channel by reading a Diversion
	  header on a REFER request. (closes issue AST-871) Reported by

	  * chan_mobile: Fixed an overrun where the cind_state buffer (an
	  integer array of size 16) would be overrun due to improper bounds
	  checking. At worst, the buffer can be overrun by a total of 48
	  bytes (assuming 4-byte integers), which would still leave it
	  within the allocated memory of struct hfp. This would corrupt
	  other elements in that struct but not necessarily cause any
	  further issues. * app_sms: The array imsg is of size 250, while
	  the array (ud) that the data is copied into is of size 160. If
	  the size of the inbound message is greater then 160, up to 90
	  bytes could be overrun in ud. This would corrupt the user data
	  header (array udh) adjacent to ud. * chan_unistim: A number of
	  invalid memmoves are corrected. These would move data (which may
	  or may not be valid) into the ends of these buffers. * asterisk:
	  ast_console_toggle_loglevel does not check that the console log
	  level being set is less then or equal to the allowed log levels
	  of 32. * format_pref: In ast_codec_pref_prepend, if any
	  occurrence of the specified codec is not found, the value used to
	  index into the array pref->order would be one greater then the
	  maximum size of the array. * jitterbuf: If the element being
	  placed into the jitter buffer lands in the last available slot in
	  the jitter history buffer, the insertion sort attempts to move
	  the last entry in the buffer into one slot past the maximum
	  length of the buffer. Note that this occurred for both the min
	  and max jitter history buffers. * tdd: If a read from fsk_serial
	  returns a character that is greater then 32, an attempt to read
	  past one of the statically defined arrays containing the values
	  that character maps to would occur. * localtime: struct ast_time
	  and tm are not the same size - ast_time is larger, although it
	  contains the elements of tm within it in the same layout. Hence,
	  when using memcpy to copy the contents of tm into ast_time, the
	  size of tm should be used, as opposed to the size of ast_time. *
	  extconf: this treats ast_timing's minmask array as if it had a
	  length of 48, when it has defined the size of the array as 24.
	  pbx.h defines minmask as having a size of 48. (issue

	  15 lines Fix reference leaks involving SIP Replaces transfers The
	  reference held for SIP blind transfers using the Replaces header
	  in an INVITE was never freed on success and also failed to be
	  freed in some error conditions. This caused a file descriptor
	  leak since the RTP structures in use at the time of the transfer
	  were never freed. This reference leak and another relating to
	  subscriptions in the same code path have now been corrected.

	  continuation of the patch in r356604, which allowed for the
	  reloading of SRTP keys in re-INVITE transfer scenarios, this
	  patch addresses the more common case where a new key is requested
	  within the context of a current SIP dialog. This can occur, for
	  example, when certain phones request a SIP hold. Previously, once
	  a dialog was associated with an SRTP object, any subsequent
	  attempt to process crypto keys in any SDP offer - either the
	  current one or a new offer in a new SIP request - were ignored.
	  This patch changes this behavior to only ignore subsequent crypto
	  keys within the current SDP offer, but allows future SDP offers
	  to change the keys. (issue ASTERISK-19253) Reported by: Thomas

	  | 43 lines Prevent overflow in calculation in ast_tvdiff_ms on
	  32-bit machines The method ast_tvdiff_ms attempts to calculate
	  the difference, in milliseconds, between two timeval structs, and
	  return the difference in a 64-bit integer. Unfortunately, it
	  assumes that the long tv_sec/tv_usec members in the timeval
	  struct are large enough to hold the calculated values before it
	  returns. On 64-bit machines, this might be the case, as a long
	  may be 64-bits. On 32-bit machines, however, a long may be less
	  (32-bits), in which case, the calculation can overflow. This
	  overflow caused significant problems in MixMonitor, which uses
	  the method to determine if an audio factory, which has not
	  presented audio to an audiohook, is merely late in providing said
	  audio or will never provide audio. In an overflow situation, the
	  audiohook would incorrectly determine that an audio factory that
	  will never provide audio is merely late instead. This led to
	  situations where a MixMonitor never recorded any audio. Note that
	  this happened most frequently when that MixMonitor was started by
	  the ConfBridge application itself, or when the MixMonitor was
	  attached to a Local channel. (issue ASTERISK-19497) Reported by:

	* Fix crash in ConfBridge when user announcement is played for more
	  than 2 users

	  A patch introduced in r354938 made it so that ConfBridge would not
	  attempt to play sound files if those files did not exist.
	  Unfortunately, ConfBridge uses the same underlying fucntion,
	  play_sound_helper, to playback both the sound files and numbers to
	  callers. When a number is being played back, the name of the sound
	  file is expected to be NULL. This NULL value was passed into a
	  function that tested for the existance of a sound file and is not
	  tolerant to NULL file names, causing a crash.

	  This patch fixes the behavior, such that if a sound file does not
	  exist we do not attempt to play it, but we only attempt that check
	  if the sound file was specified in the first place. If a sound file
	  was not specified, we use the 'play number' logic in the helper
	  function.

	  | 25 lines Fix negative return handling in channel drivers In
	  chan_agent, while handling a channel indicate, the agent channel
	  driver must obtain a lock on both the agent channel, as well as
	  the channel the agent channel is using. To do so, it attempts to
	  lock the other channel first, then unlock the agent channel which
	  is locked prior to entry into the indicate handler. If this
	  unlock fails with a negative return value, which can occur if the
	  object passed to agent_indicate is an invalid ao2 object or is
	  NULL, the return value is passed directly to strerror, which can
	  only accept positive integer values. In chan_dahdi, the return
	  value of dahdi_get_index is used to directly index into the
	  sub-channel array. If dahd_get_index returns a negative value, it
	  would use that value to index into the array, which could cause
	  an invalid memory access. If dahdi_get_index returns a negative

	  | 29 lines Fix places in resources where a negative return value
	  could impact execution This patch addresses a number of modules
	  in resources that did not handle the negative return value from
	  function calls adequately. This includes: * res_agi.c: if the
	  result of the read function is a negative number, indicating some
	  failure, the result would instead be treated as the number of
	  bytes read. This patch now treats negative results in the same
	  manner as an end of file condition, with the exception that it
	  also logs the error code indicated by the return. *
	  res_musiconhold.c: if spawn_mp3 fails to assign a file descriptor
	  to srcfd, and instead assigns a negative value, that file
	  descriptor could later be passed to functions that require a
	  valid file descriptor. If spawn_mp3 fails, we now immediately
	  retry instead of continuing in the logic. * res_rtp_asterisk.c:
	  if no codec can be matched between two RTP instances in a peer to
	  peer bridge, we immediately return instead of attempting to use
	  the codec payload type as an index to determine the appropriate
	  negotiated codec. (issue ASTERISK-19655) Reported by: Matt Jordan

	  Apr 2012) | 50 lines Fix a variety of potential buffer overflows
	  * chan_mobile: Fixed an overrun where the cind_state buffer (an
	  integer array of size 16) would be overrun due to improper bounds
	  checking. At worst, the buffer can be overrun by a total of 48
	  bytes (assuming 4-byte integers), which would still leave it
	  within the allocated memory of struct hfp. This would corrupt
	  other elements in that struct but not necessarily cause any
	  further issues. * app_sms: The array imsg is of size 250, while
	  the array (ud) that the data is copied into is of size 160. If
	  the size of the inbound message is greater then 160, up to 90
	  bytes could be overrun in ud. This would corrupt the user data
	  header (array udh) adjacent to ud. * chan_unistim: A number of
	  invalid memmoves are corrected. These would move data (which may
	  or may not be valid) into the ends of these buffers. * asterisk:
	  ast_console_toggle_loglevel does not check that the console log
	  level being set is less then or equal to the allowed log levels
	  of 32. * format_pref: In ast_codec_pref_prepend, if any
	  occurrence of the specified codec is not found, the value used to
	  index into the array pref->order would be one greater then the
	  maximum size of the array. * jitterbuf: If the element being
	  placed into the jitter buffer lands in the last available slot in
	  the jitter history buffer, the insertion sort attempts to move
	  the last entry in the buffer into one slot past the maximum
	  length of the buffer. Note that this occurred for both the min
	  and max jitter history buffers. * tdd: If a read from fsk_serial
	  returns a character that is greater then 32, an attempt to read
	  past one of the statically defined arrays containing the values
	  that character maps to would occur. * localtime: struct ast_time
	  and tm are not the same size - ast_time is larger, although it
	  contains the elements of tm within it in the same layout. Hence,
	  when using memcpy to copy the contents of tm into ast_time, the
	  size of tm should be used, as opposed to the size of ast_time. *
	  extconf: this treats ast_timing's minmask array as if it had a
	  length of 48, when it has defined the size of the array as 24.
	  pbx.h defines minmask as having a size of 48. (issue

	  | 43 lines Prevent overflow in calculation in ast_tvdiff_ms on
	  32-bit machines The method ast_tvdiff_ms attempts to calculate
	  the difference, in milliseconds, between two timeval structs, and
	  return the difference in a 64-bit integer. Unfortunately, it
	  assumes that the long tv_sec/tv_usec members in the timeval
	  struct are large enough to hold the calculated values before it
	  returns. On 64-bit machines, this might be the case, as a long
	  may be 64-bits. On 32-bit machines, however, a long may be less
	  (32-bits), in which case, the calculation can overflow. This
	  overflow caused significant problems in MixMonitor, which uses
	  the method to determine if an audio factory, which has not
	  presented audio to an audiohook, is merely late in providing said
	  audio or will never provide audio. In an overflow situation, the
	  audiohook would incorrectly determine that an audio factory that
	  will never provide audio is merely late instead. This led to
	  situations where a MixMonitor never recorded any audio. Note that
	  this happened most frequently when that MixMonitor was started by
	  the ConfBridge application itself, or when the MixMonitor was

	Revision 360862 was intended to improve identities sent in dialog-info
	NOTIFY requests. Some users reported that hint became broken once this
	was done. It's not clear exactly what part of the patch has caused
	this regression, but broken hints are bad.

	For now, this revision is being reverted so that the next releases of
	Asterisk do not have bad behavior in them. The original reported issue
	will have to be fixed differently in the next version of Asterisk.

	* /, main/features.c: Fix potential race condition during call
	  pickup. Prior to this patch, a connected line update was queued
	  during call pickup and then an answer frame was queued. The
	  original caller would presumably then have his connected line
	  updated and then the call would be answered. In actuality, the
	  answer frame was not how the call ended up being answered.
	  Rather, an odd section in app_dial that checks if the called
	  channel's state is up. The result is that the order of the
	  connected line update and the answer were variable. In most
	  cases, this wasn't actually a bad thing. However, if the 'I'
	  option was passed to dial, the connected line update would be
	  inhibited. The fix is to queued the connected line after the
	  answer frame is queued. This way the race in app_dial is between
	  two conditions resulting in an answer. This way the connected
	  line update occurs after the answer every time. (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure Asterisk sends a BYE when pending
	  on the final response to a re-INVITE When Asterisk detects a
	  hangup and cannot send a BYE due to a pending INVITE, it sets the
	  pendingbye flag and waits for the final response to that INVITE.
	  When the response is received, it transmits the BYE. If, however,
	  that INVITE request is a pending re-INVITE, it needs to first
	  send a CANCEL request to terminate the pending re-INVITE. In that
	  circumstance, Asterisk was, in some scenarios, clearing the
	  pendingbye flag after processing the CANCEL request and not
	  checking for a pending BYE when receiving the final 487 response
	  to the INVITE. This patch ensures that if the pendingbye flag is
	  set, it is honored regardless of the nature of the INVITE request
	  currently in flight. (closes issue ASTERISK-19365) Reported by:

	* main/manager.c, /, include/asterisk/manager.h: Allow AMI action
	  callback to be reentrant. Fix AMI module reload deadlock
	  regression from ASTERISK-18479 when it tried to fix the race
	  between calling an AMI action callback and unregistering that
	  action. Refixes ASTERISK-13784 broken by ASTERISK-17785 change.
	  Locking the ao2 object guaranteed that there were no active
	  callbacks that mattered when ast_manager_unregister() was called.
	  Unfortunately, this causes the deadlock situation. The patch
	  stops locking the ao2 object to allow multiple threads to invoke
	  the callback re-entrantly. There is no way to guarantee a module
	  unload will not crash because of an active callback. The code
	  attempts to minimize the chance with the registered flag and the
	  maximum 5 second delay before ast_manager_unregister() returns.
	  The trunk version of the patch changes the API to fix the race
	  condition correctly to prevent the module code from unloading
	  from memory while an action callback is active. * Don't hold the
	  lock while calling the AMI action callback. (closes issue

	* /, main/jitterbuf.c: Fix incorrect jitter buffer overflow due to
	  missed resynchronizations When a change in time occurs, such that
	  the timestamps associated with frames being placed into an
	  adaptive jitter buffer (implemented in jitterbuf.c) are
	  significantly different then the previously inserted frames, the
	  jitter buffer checks to see if it needs to be resynched to the
	  new time frame. If three consecutive packets break the threshold,
	  the jitter buffer resynchs itself to the new timestamps. This
	  currently only occurs when history is calculated, and hence only
	  on JB_TYPE_VOICE frames. JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames, on the other
	  hand, are never passed to the history calculations. Because of
	  this, if the jump in time is greater then the maximum allowed
	  length of the jitter buffer, the JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames are
	  dropped and no resynchronization occurs. Alterntively, if the
	  overfill logic is not triggered, the JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame will
	  be placed into the buffer, but with a time reference that is not
	  applicable. Subsequent JB_TYPE_VOICE frames will quickly trigger
	  the overflow logic until reads from the jitter buffer reach the
	  errant JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame. This patch allows JB_TYPE_CONTROL
	  frames to resynch the jitter buffer. As JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames
	  are unlikely to occur in multiples, it perform the
	  resynchronization on any JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame that breaks the
	  resynch threshold. Note that this only impacts chan_iax2, as
	  other consumers of the adaptive jitter buffer use the abstract
	  jitter buffer API, which does not use JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames.

	  utils/ael_main.c, apps/app_stack.c, utils/conf2ael.c: Enable
	  macros in 1.8 to find the next highest "h" extension in a
	  context, like in 1.4. This change restores functionality that was
	  present in 1.4, when AEL macros were implemented with the Macro
	  dialplan application. Macros are fraught with functionality
	  issues, because they consume a large portion of the underlying
	  application stack. This limits the ability of AEL users to call
	  many layers of subroutines, an issue which Gosub does not have
	  (originally tested to 100,000 levels deep). Therefore, starting
	  in 1.6.0, AEL macros were implemented with Gosub. However, there
	  were some implicit behaviors of Macro, which were not replicated
	  at the same time as with the transition to Gosub, one of which is
	  documented in the related issue. In particular, the "h" extension
	  is designed to execute not in the Macro context, but in the
	  topmost calling context. Due to legacy issues with a misapplied
	  bugfix many years ago, when a macro exited in 1.4, it looks in
	  all calling contexts, bubbling up from the deepest level until it
	  finds an "h" extension. Since AEL hides the complexity of the
	  underlying dialplan logic from the AEL programmer, it's
	  reasonable to assume that this behavior should not change in the
	  transition from Asterisk 1.4 LTS to Asterisk 1.8 LTS, lest we
	  break working AEL configurations in the transition to Asterisk
	  1.8 LTS. This fix is the result, which implements a search for
	  the "h" extension in all calling Gosub contexts. Fixes

	* main/channel.c, /: Fix race condition that can cause important
	  control frames (such as a hangup) to be missed. This takes two
	  actions. 1. Move the reading of the alertpipe in __ast_read() to
	  immediately before the removal of frames from the readq. This
	  means we won't do something silly like read from the alertpipe,
	  then ignore the fact that there's a frame to get from the readq
	  since channel's fdno is the AST_TIMING_FD. 2. When
	  ast_settimeout() sets the rate to 0 and the timingfunc to NULL,
	  if the channel's fdno is the AST_TIMING_FD, then set the fdno to
	  -1. This is because if the rate is 0 and the timingfunc is NULL,
	  it means that the channel's timing fd is being invalidated, so
	  any pending reads should not occur. This may actually solve more
	  issues than the referenced one below, but it's not known at this

	  regression by allowing AMI action callback to be reentrant

	  Fix AMI module reload deadlock from ASTERISK-18479 when it tired to
	  fix the race between calling an AMI action callback and
	  unregistering that action.  Refixes ASTERISK-13874 broken by
	  ASTERISK-17785 change.

	  Locking the ao2 object guaranteed that there were no active
	  callbacks that mattered when ast_manager_unregister() was called.
	  Unfortunately, this causes the deadlock situation.  The path stops
	  locking the ao2 object to allow multiple threads to invoke the
	  callback re-entrantly.  There is no way to guarantee a module unload
	  will not crash because of an active callback.  The code attempts to
	  minimize the chance with the registered flag and the maximum 5
	  second delay before ast_manager_unregister() returns.

	  The trunk version of the patch changes the API to fix the race
	  condition correctly to prevent the module code from unloading from
	  memory while an action callback is active.

	  * Don't hold the lock while calling the AMI action callback.

	* main/dnsmgr.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/dnsmgr.h:
	  Re-link peers by IP when dnsmgr changes the IP Asterisk's dnsmgr
	  currently takes a pointer to an ast_sockaddr and updates it
	  anytime an address resolves to something different. There are a
	  couple of issues with this. First, the ast_sockaddr is usually
	  the address of an ast_sockaddr inside a refcounted struct and we
	  never bump the refcount of those structs when using dnsmgr. This
	  makes it possible that a refresh could happen after the
	  destructor for that object is called (despite ast_dnsmgr_release
	  being called in that destructor). Second, the module using dnsmgr
	  cannot be aware of an address changing without polling for it in
	  the code. If an action needs to be taken on address update (like
	  re-linking a SIP peer in the peers_by_ip table), then polling for
	  this change negates many of the benefits of having dnsmgr in the
	  first place. This patch adds a function to the dnsmgr API that
	  calls an update callback instead of blindly updating the address
	  itself. It also moves calls to ast_dnsmgr_release outside of the
	  destructor functions and into cleanup functions that are called
	  when we no longer need the objects and increments the refcount of
	  the objects using dnsmgr since those objects are stored on the
	  ast_dnsmgr_entry struct. A helper function for returning the
	  proper default SIP port (non-tls vs tls) is also added and used.
	  This patch also incorporates changes from a patch posted by Timo
	  Teräs to ASTERISK-19106 for related dnsmgr issues. (closes issue

	  comparison of the character buffer containing the event code was
	  changed such that the buffer was first compared again '0' and '9'

	  | 27 lines Fix potential buffer overrun and memory leak when
	  executing "sip show peers" The "sip show peers" command uses a
	  fix sized array to sort the current peers in the peers
	  ao2_container. The size of the array is based on the current
	  number of peers in the container. However, once the size of the
	  array is determined, the number of peers in the container can
	  change, as the peers container is not locked. This could cause a
	  buffer overrun when populating the array, if peers were added to
	  the container after the array was created. Additionally, a memory
	  leak of the allocated array would occur if a user caused the
	  _show_peers method to return CLI_SHOWUSAGE. We now create a
	  snapshot of the current peers using an ao2_callback with the
	  OBJ_MULTIPLE flag. This size of the array is set to the number of
	  peers that the iterator will iterate over; hence, if peers are
	  added or removed from the peers container it will not affect the
	  execution of the "sip show peers" command. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix ACK routing for non-2xx responses.
	  When we send an ACK for a 2xx response to an INVITE, we are
	  supposed to use the learned route set. However, when we receive a
	  non-2xx final response to an INVITE, we are supposed to send the
	  ACK to the same place we initially sent the INVITE. We had been
	  doing this up until the changes went in that would build a route
	  set from provisional responses. That introduced a regression
	  where we would use the learned route set under all circumstances.
	  With this change, we now will set the destination of our ACK
	  based on the invitestate. If it is INV_COMPLETED then that means
	  that we have received a non-2xx final response (INV_TERMINATED
	  indicates a 2xx response was received). If it is INV_CANCELLED,
	  then that means the call is being canceled, which means that we
	  should be ACKing a 487 response. The other change introduced here
	  is setting the invitestate to INV_CONFIRMED when we send an ACK
	  *after* the reqprep instead of before. This way, we can tell in

	  include/asterisk/res_srtp.h, main/rtp_engine.c, /,
	  include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h: Allow SRTP policies to be reloaded
	  Currently, when using res_srtp, once the SRTP policy has been
	  added to the current session the policy is locked into place. Any
	  attempt to replace an existing policy, which would be needed if
	  the remote endpoint negotiated a new cryptographic key, is
	  instead rejected in res_srtp. This happens in particular in
	  transfer scenarios, where the endpoint that Asterisk is
	  communicating with changes but uses the same RTP session. This
	  patch modifies res_srtp to allow remote and local policies to be
	  reloaded in the underlying SRTP library. From the perspective of
	  users of the SRTP API, the only change is that the adding of
	  remote and local policies are now added in a single method call,
	  whereas they previously were added separately. This was changed
	  to account for the differences in handling remote and local
	  policies in libsrtp. Review:

	  messages are found in a folder, where these pointers are not
	  allocated and not NULL. In that case, an invalid free would be
	  attempted, which could crash app_voicemail. As there are a number
	  of code paths where this could occur, this patch uses the number
	  of messages detected in the folder before it attempts to free the
	  pointers. This resolves the crash detected in the Asterisk Test
	  Suite's check_voicemail_nominal test. ........ Merged revisions

	  2. If a new route set arrives in a 200 OK than was in the 1XX response
	     (perfectly possible if our outbound INVITE gets forked), then the

	* Asterisk 10.2.0-rc2 Released.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix SIP INFO DTMF handling for non-numeric
	  codes. In ASTERISK-18924, SIP INFO DTMF handling was changed to

	  uppercase alphabetic DTMF events.  When this occurred, the comparison
	  of the character buffer containing the event code was changed such
	  that the buffer was first compared against '0' and '9' to determine if
	  it was numeric.  Unfortunately, since the first character in the
	  buffer will typically be '1' in the case of non-numeric event codes
	  (10-16), this caused those codes to be converted to a DTMF event of
	  '1'.  This patch fixes that, and cleans up handling of both

	* channels/chan_sip.c,include/asterisk/dnsmgr.h,main/dnsmgr.c: Re-link
	  peers by IP when dnsmgr changes the IP  Asterisk's dnsmgr currently
	  takes a pointer to an ast_sockaddr and updates it anytime an address
	  resolves to something different. There are a couple of issues with
	  this. First, the ast_sockaddr is usually the address of an ast_sockaddr
	  inside a refcounted struct and we never bump the refcount of those
	  structs when using dnsmgr. This makes it possible that a refresh could
	  happen after the destructor for that object is called (despite 
	  ast_dnsmgr_release being called in that destructor). Second, the
	  module using dnsmgr cannot be aware of an address changing without
	  polling for it in the code. If an action needs to be taken on address
	  update (like re-linking a SIP peer in the peers_by_ip table), then
	  polling for this change negates many of the benefits of having dnsmgr
	  in the first place.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Use built-in parsing functions for
	  Contact and Record-Route headers. If a Contact or a Record-Route
	  header had a quoted string with an item in angle brackets, then
	  we would mis-parse it. For instance, "Bob <1234>"
	  <1234@example.org> would be misparsed as having the URI "1234"
	  The fix for this is to use parsing functions from
	  reqresp_parser.h since they are heavily tested and are awesome.

	  | 22 lines Add some missing locking in chan_sip. This patch adds
	  some missing locking to the function
	  send_provisional_keepalive_full(). This function is called from
	  the scheduler, which is processed in the SIP monitor thread. The
	  associated channel (or pbx) thread will also be using the same
	  sip_pvt and ast_channel so locking must be used. The
	  sip_pvt_lock_full() function is used to ensure proper locking
	  order in a safe manner. In passing, document a suspected
	  reference counting error in this function. The "fix" is left
	  commented out because when the "fix" is present, crashes occur.
	  My theory is that fixing it is exposing a reference counting
	  error elsewhere, but I don't know where. (Or my analysis of this
	  being a problem could have been completely wrong in the first
	  place). Leave the comment in the code for so that someone may
	  investigate it again in the future. Also add a bit of doxygen to
	  transmit_provisional_response(). (closes issue ASTERISK-18979)

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure ACK retransmit & hangup on non-200
	  response to INVITE When handling a non-2xx final response on an
	  INVITE transaction, we have to keep the transaction around after
	  we send an ACK in case we receive a retransmission of the
	  response so we can re-transmit the ACK, but also tear down the
	  ast_channel as soon as we transmit the ACK. Before this patch, we
	  could fail at both of these things. Calling
	  sip_alreadygone/needdestroy prevented us from keeping the
	  transaction up and retransmitting the ACK, and queueing
	  CONGESTION was not sufficient to cause the channel to be torn
	  down when originating calls via the CLI, for example. This patch
	  queues a hangup with CONGESTION instead of just queueing
	  CONGESTION for these responses and removes the sip_alreadygone
	  and sip_needdestroy calls from handle_response_invite on non-2xx
	  responses. It relies on the hangup calling sip_scheddestroy. For
	  more information, see section 17.1.1.1 of RFC 3261. (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Don't prematurely stop SIP session timer
	  When Asterisk is the UAS (incoming call, endpoint is re-inviting)
	  the SIP session timer expires after half the time the sip
	  endpoint indicates in the Session-expires header in
	  proc_session_timer(). The session timer was being stopped totally

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Create and initialize udptl only when
	  dialog negotiates for image media Prior to this patch, the udptl
	  struct was allocated and initialized when a dialog was associated
	  with a peer that supported T.38, when a new SIP channel was
	  allocated, or what an INVITE request was received. This resulted
	  in any dialog associated with a peer that supported T.38 having
	  udptl support assigned to it, including the UDP ports needed for
	  communication. This occurred even in non-INVITE dialogs that
	  would never send image media. This patch creates and initializes
	  the udptl structure only when the SDP for a dialog specifies that
	  image media is supported, or when Asterisk indicates through the
	  appropriate control frame that a dialog is to support T.38.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Don't leak CID in From header when
	  presentation=unavailable When someone does
	  Set(CALLERPRES()=unavailable) (or
	  Set(CALLERID(pres)=unavailable)) when sendrpid=no, the From
	  header shows "Anonymous" <anonymous@anonymous.invalid>. When
	  sendrpid=yes/pai, the From header will still display the callerid
	  info, even though we supply an rpid header with the anonymous
	  info. It seems like we shouldn't leak that info in any case.
	  Skimming http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-privacy-04
	  seems to indicate that one shouldn't send identifying info in the
	  From in this case. This patch anonymizes the From header as well
	  even when sendrpid=yes/pai. (closes issue ASTERISK-16538) Review:

	  3) Write audio to the channel that is bridged to the channel that
	  we are spying on. The first is always necessary, but the others
	  are used only when specific options are passed to the ChanSpy
	  application (B, d, w, and W to be specific). When those flags are
	  not passed, neither of those audiohooks are ever sent frames, but
	  we still try to process the hooks for each voice frame that we
	  recieve on the channel. So in short - only create and attach
	  audiohooks that we actually need. ........

	* main/pbx.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h: Fix
	  extension state callback references in chan_sip. Chan_sip gives a
	  dialog reference to the extension state callback and assumes that
	  when ast_extension_state_del() returns, the callback cannot
	  happen anymore. Chan_sip then reduces the dialog reference count
	  associated with the callback. Recent changes (ASTERISK-17760)
	  have resulted in the potential for the callback to happen after
	  ast_extension_state_del() has returned. For chan_sip, this could
	  be very bad because the dialog pointer could have already been
	  destroyed. * Added ast_extension_state_add_destroy() so chan_sip
	  can account for the sip_pvt reference given to the extension
	  state callback when the extension state callback is deleted. *
	  Fix pbx.c awkward statecbs handling in
	  ast_extension_state_add_destroy() and handle_statechange() now
	  that the struct ast_state_cb has a destructor to call. * Ensure
	  that ast_extension_state_add_destroy() will never return -1 or 0
	  for a successful registration. * Fixed pbx.c statecbs_cmp() to
	  compare the correct information. The passed in value to compare
	  is a change_cb function pointer not an object pointer. * Make
	  pbx.c ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() not perform callbacks with
	  AST_EXTENSION_REMOVED with locks held. Chan_sip is notorious for
	  deadlocking when those locks are held during the callback. *
	  Removed unused lock declaration for the pbx.c store_hints list.

	* main/channel.c, /, main/features.c: Clean-up on isle five for
	  __ast_request_and_dial() and ast_call_forward(). * Add locking
	  when a channel inherits variables and datastores in
	  __ast_request_and_dial() and ast_call_forward(). Note: The
	  involved channels are not active so there was minimal potential
	  for problems. * Remove calls to ast_set_callerid() in
	  __ast_request_and_dial() and ast_call_forward() because the set
	  information is for the wrong direction. * Don't use C++ keywords
	  for variable names in ast_call_forward(). * Run the redirecting
	  interception macro if defined when forwarding a call in
	  ast_call_forward(). Note: Currently will never execute because
	  the only callers that supply a calling channel supply a hungup or
	  zombie channel. * Make feature_request_and_dial() put the
	  transferee into autoservice when it calls ast_call_forward() in
	  case a redirection interception macro is run. Note: Currently
	  will never happen because the caller channel (Party B) is always
	  hungup at this time. * Make feature_request_and_dial() ignore the
	  AST_CONTROL_PROCEEDING frame to silence a log message. ........

	* apps/app_originate.c: Added support for all slin formats to
	  app_originate Previously, app_originate could not originate a
	  call into a non-8kHz conference bridge as the formats for
	  non-8kHz slin codecs were not applied to the created channel.
	  This patch adds all of the formats by default, such that if a
	  created channel has a codec that supports a higher sampling rate,
	  a translation path can be built between it and other channels.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixed Asterisk crash when function QUEUE_MEMBER
	  receives invalid input The function QUEUE_MEMBER has two required
	  parameters (queuename, option). It was only checking for the
	  presence of queuename. The patch checks for the existence of the
	  option parameter and provides better error logging when invalid
	  values are provided for the option parameter as well.

	  FollowMe CallerID on outgoing calls. The addition of the

	* res/res_srtp.c, /: Add a separate buffer for SRTCP packets The
	  function ast_srtp_protect used a common buffer for both SRTP and
	  SRTCP packets. Since this function can be called from multiple
	  threads for the same SRTP session (scheduler for SRTCP and
	  channel for SRTP) it was possible for the packets to become
	  corrupted as the buffer was used by both threads simultaneously.

	  end-of-range character in character sets. This has a slight
	  change in behavior if the end-of-range character is an escape
	  character. You must now escape it. * Fix potential sign extension
	  issue when expanding character set ranges. * Made remove
	  duplicated characters from character sets. The duplicate
	  characters lower extension matching priority and prevent
	  duplicate extension detection. * Fix escape character handling
	  when the escape character is trying to escape the end-of-string.
	  We could have continued processing characters after the end of
	  the exten string. We could have added the previous character to

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix regressed behavior of queue set penalty to
	  work without specifying 'in <queuename>' r325483 caused a
	  regression in Asterisk 10+ that would make Asterisk segfault when
	  attempting to set penalty on an interface without specifying a
	  queue in the queue set penalty CLI command. In addition, no
	  attempt would be made whatsoever to perform the penalty setting
	  on all the queues in the core list with either the cli command or
	  the non-segfaulting ami equivalent. This patch fixes that and
	  also makes an attempt to document and rename some functions
	  required by this command to better represent what they actually
	  do. Oh yeah, and the use of this command without specifying a
	  specific queue actually works now. Review:

	* /, main/features.c: Mark channel running the h exten with the

	  might execute the h exten on the calling channel. However, that

	  hanging up. The channel executing the h exten must be in a hung
	  up state so things like AGI run in the correct mode. * Make sure
	  ast_bridge_call() marks the channel it is executing the h exten
	  on as hung up. (The AST_SOFTHANGUP_APPUNLOAD flag is used so as
	  to match the pbx.c main dialplan execution loop when it executes

	* include/asterisk/message.h, main/message.c: Fixes memory leak in
	  message API. The ast_msg_get_var function did not properly
	  decrement the ref count of the var it retrieves. The way this is
	  implemented is a bit tricky, as we must decrement the var and
	  then return the var's value. As long as the documentation for the
	  function is followed, this will not result in a dangling pointer
	  as the ast_msg structure owns its own reference to the var while
	  it exists in the var container.

	  realtime caching MOH no longer properly resumes playing back a

	  scanning for new files causes the existing file array to be
	  emptied and we were just comparing that the saved pointer to the
	  filename matched the pointer to the filename in a particular
	  position in the array. An easy fix is to save the filename
	  instead of a pointer to it and then do a strcmp instead of
	  comparing the addresses. (closes issue ASTERISK-18912) Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample, CHANGES: Default
	  to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ It is
	  possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
	  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a
	  request is sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via
	  header. In 1.4 and 1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was
	  nat=yes or nat=route and the other was either nat=no or
	  nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one was
	  nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no. In order to address
	  this problem, it was decided to switch the default behavior to
	  nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option and to
	  strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
	  possible. For more discussion of the issue, please see:

	  issue ASTERISK-18702. * Added 'dtmf' enum value to sip.conf

	  channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h: Don't
	  treat a host:port string as a domain The domain matching code
	  prior to 1.8 used to manually remove the port from the host:port
	  string when determining if an incoming request matched the list
	  of domains. When switching to the new parsing functions, the
	  documentation implied that the "domain" was being returned by
	  these functions, when instead it was returning the "hostport" as
	  defined by RFC 3261. This led to confusion and resulted in 1.8+
	  rejecting an incoming request from x.x.x.x:xxxxx when
	  domain=x.x.x.x was set in sip.conf. This patch renames the
	  "domain" variables in the parsing functions to "hostport" to more
	  accurately describe what it is that they are returning and also
	  properly truncates the resulting hostport strings when dealing
	  with domain matching. Review:

	* Fixed crash from orphaned MWI subscriptions in chan_sip

	  This patch resolves the issue where MWI subscriptions are orphaned
	  by subsequent SIP SUBSCRIBE messages.  When a peer is removed, either
	  by pruning realtime SIP peers or by unloading / loading chan_sip, the
	  MWI subscriptions that were orphaned would still be on the event engine
	  list of valid subscriptions but have a pointer to a peer that no longer
	  was valid.  When an MWI event would occur, this would cause a seg fault.

	* Fix a change in behavior in 'database show' from 1.8.

	  In 1.8 and previous versions, one could use any fullword portion of

	  patch, this did not work for the full key.

	   (closes issue ASTERISK-18886)

	* Default to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ

	  AST-2011-013.  It is possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
	  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a request is
	  sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via header. In 1.4 and
	  1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was nat=yes or nat=route and the other
	  was either nat=no or nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one
	  was nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no.

	  In order to address this problem, it was decided to switch the default
	  behavior to nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option
	  and to strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
	  possible.

	  For more discussion of the issue, please see:

	  When using the MessageSend application to send a SIP MESSAGE to a

	  structure before transmitting. This patch adds the full URI passed in
	  from the message core to the sip_pvt structure.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/extconfig.conf.sample,
	  include/asterisk/config.h, main/config.c: Several fixes to the
	  chan_sip dynamic realtime peer/user lookup There were several
	  problems with the dynamic realtime peer/user lookup code. The
	  lookup logic had become rather hard to read due to lots of
	  incremental changes to the realtime_peer function. And, during
	  the addition of the sipregs functionality, several possibilities
	  for memory leaks had been introduced. The insecure=port matching
	  has always been broken for anyone using the sipregs family. And,
	  related, the broken implementation forced those using sipregs to
	  *still* have an ipaddr column on their sippeers table. Thanks
	  Terry Wilson for comprehensive testing and finding and fixing
	  unexpected behaviour from the multientry realtime call which
	  caused the realtime_peer to have a completely unused code path.
	  This changeset fixes the leaks, the lookup inconsistenties and
	  that you won't need an ipaddr column on your sippeers table
	  anymore (when you're using sipregs). Beware that when you're
	  using sipregs, peers with insecure=port will now start matching!

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: Simplify queue membercount code Despite an
	  ominous sounding comment stating that membercount was for "logged
	  in" members only and thus we couldn't use ao2_container_count(),
	  I could not find a single place in the code where that seemed to
	  be accurate. The only time we decremented membercount was when we
	  were marking something dead or actually removing it. The only
	  places we incremented it were either after ao2_link(), or trying
	  to correct for having set it to 0 during a reload. In every case
	  where we were correcting the value, it seemed that we were trying
	  to make the count actually match what ao2_container_count() would
	  return. The only place I could find where we made a determination
	  about something being "logged in" or not, we didn't trust the
	  membercount, but instead looked at devicestate, paused, etc. This
	  patch removes membercount, replaces its use with
	  ao2_container_count, and manually adds the results of
	  ao2_container_count to a "membercount" field for ast_data queue
	  query results. This patch also would fix AST-676, but as it is
	  slightly riskier than the previously committed fix, the two

	  into place This fixes the inotify code to handle call files being
	  hardlinked into the spool directory. The smsq utility does this,
	  instead of rename(), to ensure that it cannot accidentally
	  overwrite an existing spool file. A rename() might do that, but
	  link() will definitely not. The inotify code had broken this,
	  because it would wait for an IN_CLOSE_WRITE event on the file...
	  which was never forthcoming, since it was never opened. Now we
	  look for IN_OPEN events following the IN_CREATE event, and only
	  wait for an IN_CLOSE_WRITE if the file was actually opened.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix a performance regression introduced in
	  r325483. The regression was caused by a call to
	  ast_parse_device_state() in app_queue's ring_entry() function.
	  The ast_parse_device_state() function eventually calls
	  ast_channel_get_full() with a channel name prefix which causes it
	  to walk the channel list causing massive lock contention and slow
	  downs. This patch fixes the regression by removing the call to
	  ast_parase_device_state() which should be unnecessary. Queue
	  member device state should be maintained by device state events.
	  Some users have seen instances where busy agents were called when
	  they shouldn't have, which is the reason the call to
	  ast_parse_device_state() was added. That change appears to have
	  resolved that issue but also causes this performance regression.
	  There may still be issues with queue member status, and if so,
	  alternative methods should be investigated to resolve them.

	  | 21 lines Fix for incorrect voicemail duration in external
	  notifications This patch fixes an issue where the voicemail
	  duration was being reported with a duration significantly less
	  than the actual sound file duration. Voicemails that contained
	  mostly silence were reporting the duration of only the sound in
	  the file, as opposed to the duration of the file with the
	  silence. This patch fixes this by having two durations reported
	  in the __ast_play_and_record family of functions - the
	  sound_duration and the actual duration of the file. The
	  sound_duration, which is optional, now reports the duration of
	  the sound in the file, while the actual full duration of the file
	  is reported in the duration parameter. This allows the voicemail
	  applications to use the sound_duration for minimum duration
	  checking, while reporting the full duration to external parties
	  if the voicemail is kept. (issue ASTERISK-2234) (closes issue

	  Sep 2011) | 36 lines Fix crashes in ast_rtcp_write(). This patch
	  addresses crashes related to RTCP handling. The backtraces just
	  show a crash in ast_rtcp_write() where it appears that the RTP
	  instance is no longer valid. There is a race condition with
	  scheduled RTCP transmissions and the destruction of the RTP
	  instance. This patch utilizes the fact that ast_rtp_instance is a
	  reference counted object and ensures that it will not get
	  destroyed while a reference is still around due to scheduled RTCP
	  transmissions. RTCP transmissions are scheduled and executed from
	  the chan_sip scheduler context. This scheduler context is
	  processed in the SIP monitor thread. The destruction of an RTP
	  instance occurs when the associated sip_pvt gets destroyed (which
	  happens when the sip_pvt reference count reaches 0). However, the
	  SIP monitor thread is not the only thread that can cause a
	  sip_pvt to get destroyed. The sip_hangup function, executed from
	  a channel thread, also decrements the reference count on a
	  sip_pvt and could cause it to get destroyed. While this is being
	  changed anyway, the patch also removes calling ast_sched_del()
	  from within the RTCP scheduler callback. It's not helpful. Simply
	  returning 0 prevents the callback from being rescheduled. (closes

	  | 23 lines Updated SIP 484 handling; added Incomplete control
	  frame When a SIP phone uses the dial application and receives a
	  484 Address Incomplete response, if overlapped dialing is enabled
	  for SIP, then the 484 Address Incomplete is forwarded back to the
	  SIP phone and the HANGUPCAUSE channel variable is set to 28.
	  Previously, the Incomplete application dialplan logic was
	  automatically triggered; now, explicit dialplan usage of the
	  application is required. Additionally, this patch adds a new
	  AST_CONTOL_FRAME type called AST_CONTROL_INCOMPLETE. If a channel
	  driver receives this control frame, it is an indication that the
	  dialplan expects more digits back from the device. If the device
	  supports overlap dialing it should attempt to notify the device
	  that the dialplan is waiting for more digits; otherwise, it can
	  handle the frame in a manner appropriate to the channel driver.

	  ast_odbc_clear_cache. As a function pointer, the reference has to
	  be resolved at load time irrespective of the RTLD_LAZY flag.
	  Creating a local alias solves this problem, because the structure
	  is initialized with that local function pointer, while the actual
	  function can remain lazily linked until runtime. The reason why
	  this is important is because we lazily load function references
	  during the module loading process, in order to obtain priority
	  values for each module, ensuring that modules are loaded in the
	  correct order. Previous to this change, when this module was
	  initially loaded, the module loader would emit a symbol
	  resolution error, because of the above requirement. Closes

	  | 43 lines Call pickup race leaves orphaned channels or crashes.
	  Multiple users attempting to pickup a call that has been forked
	  to multiple extensions either crashes or fails a masquerade with
	  a "bad things may happen" message. This is the scenario that is
	  causing all the grief: 1) Pickup target is selected 2) target is
	  marked as being picked up in ast_do_pickup() 3) target is
	  unlocked by ast_do_pickup() 4) app dial or queue gets a chance to
	  hang up losing calls and calls ast_hangup() on target 5) SINCE A
	  MASQUERADE HAS NOT BEEN SETUP YET BY ast_do_pickup() with
	  ast_channel_masquerade(), ast_hangup() completes successfully and
	  the channel is no longer in the channels container. 6)
	  ast_do_pickup() then calls ast_channel_masquerade() to schedule
	  the masquerade on the dead channel. 7) ast_do_pickup() then calls
	  ast_do_masquerade() on the dead channel 8) bad things happen
	  while doing the masquerade and in the process ast_do_masquerade()
	  puts the dead channel back into the channels container 9) The
	  "orphaned" channel is visible in the channels list if a crash
	  does not happen. This patch does the following: * Made
	  ast_hangup() set AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE on a successfully hung-up
	  channel and not release the channel lock until that has happened.
	  * Made __ast_channel_masquerade() not setup a masquerade if
	  either channel has AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE set. * Fix chan_agent misuse
	  of AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE since it would no longer work. (closes issue

	  | 26 lines Outgoing BRI calls fail when using Asterisk 1.8 with
	  HA8, HB8, and B410P cards. France Telecom brings layer 2 and
	  layer 1 down on BRI lines when the line is idle. When layer 1
	  goes down Asterisk cannot make outgoing calls and the HA8 and HB8
	  cards also get IRQ misses. The inability to make outgoing calls
	  is because the line is in red alarm and Asterisk will not make
	  calls over a line it considers unavailable. The IRQ misses for
	  the HA8 and HB8 card are because the hardware is switching clock
	  sources from the line which just brought layer 1 down to internal
	  timing. There is a DAHDI option for the B410P card to not tell
	  Asterisk that layer 1 went down so Asterisk will allow outgoing
	  calls: "modprobe wcb4xxp teignored=1". There is a similar DAHDI
	  option for the HA8 and HB8 cards: "modprobe wctdm24xxp
	  bri_teignored=1". Unfortunately that will not clear up the IRQ
	  misses when the telco brings layer 1 down. * Add layer 2
	  persistence option to customize the layer 2 behavior on BRI PTMP
	  lines. The new option has three settings: 1) Use libpri default
	  layer 2 setting. 2) Keep layer 2 up. Bring layer 2 back up when
	  the peer brings it down. 3) Leave layer 2 down when the peer
	  brings it down. Layer 2 will be brought up as needed for outgoing
	  calls. JIRA AST-598 ........

	  Currently, logger only prints an error message to stderr when it
	  fails to open a logger channel where many users will not see it
	  because the logger lock is held. The alternative provided by this
	  patch is to log the error to all attached consoles in the hopes
	  that it will be easier to see. Additionally, this patch prevents
	  the failed logger channel from being added to the list where it
	  would silently fail on each call to the Asterisk logger. (closes

	  17 lines Fixes some voicemail forwarding behavior based around
	  prepend mode. Formerly, prepend forwarding would have the user
	  record a message with no useful prompt and an expectation for the
	  user to push a button on the phone when finished recording. If a
	  length of silence was detected instead, the recording would be
	  canceled and the user would re-enter the voicemail forwarding
	  menu. Subsequent time-outs in prepend recording would also bug
	  out in the sense that they would write over the original message
	  and get sent to the recipient regardless of whether they timed
	  out or were accepted. This patch fixes this issue and adds a
	  prompt which will be played after a timeout informing the user
	  that they needed to press a button. Currently, the sound files
	  that we have are somewhat inadquate for this, so after the call
	  we simply have Allison say "Please try again. Then press pound."
	  which actually relies on two separate sound files. Just one would
	  be more appropriate. reporter: Vlad Povorozniuc Review:

	  | 48 lines Deadlocks dealing with dialplan hints during reload.
	  There are two remaining different deadlocks reported dealing with
	  dialplan hints. The deadlock in ASTERISK-17666 is caused by
	  invalid locking order in ast_remove_hint(). The hints container
	  must be locked before the hint object. The deadlock in
	  ASTERISK-17760 is caused by a catch-22 situation in
	  handle_statechange(). The deadlock is caused by not having the
	  conlock before calling the watcher callbacks. Unfortunately,
	  having that lock causes a different deadlock as reported in
	  ASTERISK-16961. * Fixed ast_remove_hint() locking order. * Made
	  handle_statechange() no longer call the watcher callbacks holding
	  any locks that matter. * Made hint ao2 destructor do the watcher
	  callbacks for extension deactivation to guarantee that they get
	  called. * Fixed hint reference leak in ast_add_hint() if the
	  callback container constructor failed. * Fixed hint reference
	  leak in complete_core_show_hint() for every hint it found for CLI
	  tab completion. * Adjusted locking in
	  ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() for safety. * Added
	  context_merge_lock to prevent ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() and
	  handle_statechange() from interfering with each other. * Fixed
	  ast_change_hint() not taking into account that the extension is
	  used for the hash key. (closes issue ASTERISK-17666) Reported by:

	  Mac OSX). Unfortunately, the changes were incomplete and did not
	  actually provide the desired behavior, and as a side effect the
	  functionality that ensured that stale headers in the Asterisk
	  'include' directory were removed got broken. In addition, the
	  check for stale (and possibly incompatible) modules in the
	  Asterisk 'modules' directory also got broken, and would never
	  report any stale modules. Users upgrading to this version or
	  later versions would then see unexpected module load errors.
	  Since there are few users who actually want to install Asterisk
	  into paths that contain spaces, and a proper fix for the build
	  system would take many hours, the best solution for now is to
	  just revert the partial solution. ........ ................

	  of features on dialed channels that require monitoring of DTMF on
	  channels utilizing inband DTMF. This would cause Asterisk to
	  allow the call to be locally or remotely bridged, preventing

	  mixmonitor recordings. MixMonitor has the ability to record in
	  any file format Asterisk supports, but the quality of wideband
	  audio is not preserved. This is because regardless of the sample
	  rate the call is being recorded in, the audio is always
	  downsampled to 8khz and then upsampled to whatever wideband
	  format it is being written as. This patch resolves this by
	  requesting the audio from the audiohook in the signed linear
	  format closest to the sample rate of the format we are writing.
	  This fix is only possible for Asterisk 1.10 because audio hooks
	  in 1.8 are not capable of wideband audio. Review:

	  processing. The process_output() function calls ast_str_append()
	  and xml_translate() on its 'out' parameter, which is a pointer to
	  an ast_str buffer. If either of these functions need to
	  reallocate the ast_str so it will have more space, they will free
	  the existing buffer and allocate a new one, returning the address
	  of the new one. However, because process_output only receives a
	  pointer to the ast_str, not a pointer to its caller's variable
	  holding the pointer, if the original ast_str is freed, the caller
	  will not know, and will continue to use it (and later attempt to
	  free it). (reported by jkroon on #asterisk-dev) ........

	  authenticated. The code was changed to prevent this from
	  occurring, and to prevent users from having mailboxes or

	  | 14 lines Use 'printf' (POSIX issue 4) instead of 'echo -n', for
	  portability. The problem with using 'echo -n' is that it is not
	  portable. While BSD systems required that the '-n' option be
	  removed and interpreted, System V required that all strings
	  should be echoed with no interpretation of options. This
	  fundamental difference of behavior means that it is never
	  possible to use the '-n' flag to echo in tests which are meant to
	  be portable. In this case, on Mac OS X 10.6, the /bin/sh shell
	  builtin 'echo' uses the System V semantics of the command, and
	  thus the SHELL test failed on that platform.

	  utils/db1-ast/btree: Replace Berkeley DB with SQLite 3 There were
	  some bugs in the very ancient version of Berkeley DB that
	  Asterisk used. Instead of spending the time tracking down the
	  bugs in the Berkeley code we move to the much better documented
	  SQLite 3. Conversion of the old astdb happens at runtime by
	  running the included astdb2sqlite3 utility. The ast_db API with
	  SQLite 3 backend should behave identically to the old Berkeley
	  backend, but in the future we could offer a much more robust
	  interface. We do not include the SQLite 3 library in the source
	  tree, but instead rely upon the distribution-provided libraries.
	  SQLite is so ubiquitous that this should not place undue burden
	  on administrators.

	  | 23 lines Used auth= parameter freed during "sip reload" causes
	  crash. If you use the auth= parameter and do a "sip reload" while
	  there is an ongoing call. The peer->auth data points to free'd
	  memory. The patch does several things: 1) Puts the authentication
	  list into an ao2 object for reference counting to fix the
	  reported crash during a SIP reload. 2) Converts the
	  authentication list from open coding to AST list macros. 3) Adds
	  display of the global authentication list in "sip show settings".

	  | 20 lines Stop sending IPv6 link-local scope-ids in SIP messages
	  The idea behind the patch listed below was used, but in a more
	  targeted manner. There are now address stringification functions
	  for addresses that are meant to be sent to a remote party.
	  Link-local scope-ids only make sense on the machine from which
	  they originate and so are stripped in the new functions. There is
	  also a host sanitization function added to chan_sip which is used
	  for when peer and dialog tohost fields or sip_registry hostnames
	  are used to craft a SIP message. Also added are some basic unit
	  tests for netsock2 address parsing. (closes issue ASTERISK-17711)

	  extra byte outside of the bounds of the underlying fd causes a
	  bus error. The real issue is that we are working with both a FILE
	  * and the raw fd underneath it and not synchronizing between
	  them. The code that was removed in ASTERISK-15359 was correct,
	  but we weren't flushing the FILE * before mapping the fd. Looking
	  at the manager code in 1.4 reveals that the FILE * in 'struct
	  mansession' is never used except to create a temporary file that
	  we immediately fdopen. This means we just need to write a 0 byte
	  to the fd and everything will just work. The other branches
	  require a call to fflush() which, while not a guaranteed fix,
	  should reduce the likelihood of a crash. This all makes sense in

	  messaging processing engine will not proceed until something else
	  writes data to the socket, which may not occur. This change

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Move exten used for dialing from device
	  to subchannel. There were some issues where if a simple switch
	  was cancelled and a new switch started before the first had timed
	  out where the d->exten would be used for both subchannels. This
	  was bad leading to possible invalid extensions if some digits had
	  been entered in the abandoned simple switch and the second one
	  was completed before the first timed out, or the second would be
	  cancelled because d->exten would be set to nothing on the time
	  out of the first.

	* pbx/pbx_lua.c, UPGRADE.txt: Default to starting an autoservice in
	  pbx_lua. The autoservice is automatically stopped when
	  applications are executed, so this shouldn't cause any problems.

	* pbx/pbx_lua.c, UPGRADE.txt: Make pbx_lua handle managing the
	  autoservice better. Make autoservice_start() and
	  autoservice_stop() return nothing. Also check if the autoservice
	  flag is set before starting or stopping the autoservice and stop
	  and start the autoservice when returning control to and getting
	  control from the pbx engine.

	* UPGRADE.txt: Added note about changes in pbx_lua's behavior when
	  applications do dialplan jumps

	* CHANGES: Use two spaces after periods for the recent pbx_lua
	  change descriptions

	* CHANGES: Updated CHANGES for hints support in pbx_lua

	* pbx/pbx_lua.c, CHANGES: Detect Goto in pbx_lua. This code will
	  actually detect any dialplan jump from any application that calls
	  ast_explicit_goto(). This change is only being done in trunk as
	  it may change the way some dialplans execute.

	  information did not get reported until the call was connected so
	  SIP could not report connected line information in ringing or

	* channels/chan_sip.c, CHANGES: If multiple [general] contexts

	  contexts with the same name in the realtime layer, but that
	  implementation severely breaks drivers which use the same context
	  name (e.g. iax.conf, type={peer,user}). Therefore, the
	  implementation needs to do the merging for particular entries
	  only, based upon what contexts would allow that in the channel
	  driver itself. This implementation is for chan_sip only, but
	  others could be added in the future. (closes issue #17957)

	  | 18 lines Allow transfer loops without allowing forwarding loops
	  We try to avoid the situation where two phones may be forwarded
	  to each other causing an infinite loop by storing each dialed
	  interface in a channel datastore and checking the list before
	  dialing out. This works, but currently breaks situations like A
	  calls B, A transfers B to C, B transfers C to A, and A transfers
	  C to B. Since human interaction is happening here and not an
	  automated forwarding loop, it should be allowed. This patch
	  removes the dialed_interfaces datastore when a call is bridged (a
	  suggestion from the brilliant mmichelson). If a call is being
	  bridged, it should be safe to assume that we aren't stuck in a
	  loop. Since we are now handling this is the bridge code, the
	  previous attempts at handling it in app_dial and app_queue are
	  removed. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1195/

	  do_monitor. Deadlock avoidance between the sip pvt and the
	  pvt->owner is very difficult. Now that channel's are ao2 objects,
	  this complication is no longer necessary. It turns out the pvt's
	  msg queue only exists because of deadlock avoidance (when
	  deadlock avoidance fails msgs were added to a queue to be
	  processed later), so this goes away as well. The technique used
	  in the new sip_lock_pvt_full() function should be used as a
	  template for replacing all locations where deadlock avoidance
	  occurs between a channel tech_pvt and the pvt's owner. My hope is
	  that this will begin a reversal of the invalid channel driver
	  locking architecture we have been using for so long. This patch
	  also resolves an issue where the pvt->owner gets unlocked during

	  | 17 lines sip codec negotiation of dynamic rtp payloads error
	  fix This patch fixes how chan_sip handles dynamic rtp payload
	  types it does not understand. At the moment if a dynamic
	  payload's mime type does not match one we understand, the payload
	  does not get removed from our payload table. As a result of this,
	  the payload is set to whatever dynamic codec we use internally
	  for that payload number on outgoing INVITES. This is incorrect.
	  This patch fixes this by properly checking the rtpmap set
	  function's return code to make sure it was found. The function
	  can return both -1 and -2 depending on the source of the
	  mismatch. We were just checking -1 explicitly. Review:

	* CREDITS, main/ccss.c, configs/ccss.conf.sample: Add Device State
	  Information CCSS for Generic Devices. Add Asterisk Device State
	  information and callbacks to the Call Completion Supplemental
	  Services for generic agents. There are currently not many devices
	  that have native support for CCSS. Even as the devices become
	  available there may be other reasons why one may choose to not
	  take advantage of the native abilities and stick with the generic
	  implementation. The generic implementation is quite capable and
	  could be greatly enhanced by adding device state capabilities. A
	  phone could then subscribe to the device state with a BLF key in
	  conjunction with Asterisk hints. The advantages of the device
	  state information would allow a single button to: request CCSS,
	  cancel a CCSS request, and display the current state of a CCSS
	  request. For example, you may have a single button that when not
	  lit, there is no active CCSS request. When you press that button,
	  the dialplan can query the DEVICE_STATE() associated with that
	  caller to determine whether they should be calling
	  CallCompletionRequest() or CallCompletionCancel(). If there is
	  currently a pending request, then the dialplan would cancel it.
	  This also has the advantage of showing the true state of a
	  request, which is an asynchronous call, even when
	  CallCompletionRequest() thinks it was successful. The actual
	  request could ultimately fail. Once lit, further feedback can be
	  provided to the caller about the current state of their request
	  since it will be updated by the CCSS State Machine as
	  appropriate. The DEVICE_STATE mapping is configurable since the
	  BLF being used on a given phone type may vary. The idea is to
	  allow some level of customization as to the phone's behavior. As
	  an example, you may want the BLF key to go solid once you have
	  requested a callback. You may then want the LED to blink
	  (typically ringing) when either the callback is in process, which
	  is a visual indication that the incoming call is the desired
	  callback. You may want it to blink when the callee is ready but
	  you are busy, giving you a visual indication that the target is
	  available as you may want to get off the line so that the
	  callback can be successful. Device state information is sent back
	  via the ast_devstate_prov_add() callback for any generic CCSS
	  device as it traverses through the state machine. You simply
	  provide a map between CC_STATE values and the corresponding
	  AST_DEVICE state values. You could then generate hints against
	  these states similar to what is possible today with Custom
	  Devstates or MeetMe states. For example, you may have an
	  extension 3000 that is currently associated with device SIP/3000.
	  You could then create a feature code for that extension that may
	  look something like: exten => *823000,hint,ccss:sip/3000 You
	  would then subscribe a BLF button to *823000 which would point to
	  the dialplan that handled CCSS requests/cancels using the
	  available DEVICE_STATE() information about ccss:sip/3000 to make
	  the decision about what to do. (closes issue #18788) Reported by:

	  | 25 lines Stuck channel using FEATD_MF if caller hangs up at the
	  right time. The cause was actually a caller hanging up just at
	  the end of the Feature Group D DTMF tones that setup the call.
	  The reason for this is a "guard timer" that's implemented using
	  ast_safe_sleep(100). If the caller happens to hang up AFTER the
	  final tone of the DTMF string but BEFORE the end of that
	  ast_safe_sleep(), then ast_safe_sleep() will return non-zero.
	  This causes the code to bounce to the end of ss_thread(), but it
	  does NOT tear down the call properly. This should be a rare
	  occurrence because the caller has to hang up at EXACTLY the right
	  time. Nonetheless, it was happening quite regularly on the
	  reporter's system. It's not easily reproducible, unless you
	  purposely increase the guard-time to 2000 or more. Once you do
	  that, you can reproduce it every time by watching the DTMF debug
	  and hanging up just as it ends. Simply add an ast_hangup() before
	  goto quit. (closes issue #15671) Reported by: jcromes Patches:

	  feature added. The patch restores the o option behavior and adds
	  the ability to specify the CallerID. The Dial o and f options are
	  complementary to each other. The o option stores the CallerID on
	  the outgoing channel as the channel's CallerID. The f option
	  forces the CallerID sent by the outgoing channel. o(x) - The
	  argument 'x' is optional. If not present, then specify that the
	  CallerID that was present on the *calling* channel be stored as
	  the CallerID on the *called* channel. This was the behavior of
	  Asterisk 1.0 and earlier. If present, then specify the CallerID
	  stored on the *called* channel. Note that o(${CALLERID(all)}) is
	  similar to option o without parameters. f(x) - The argument 'x'
	  is optional and its presence changes the behavior of this option.
	  If not present, then force the outgoing CallerID on a
	  call-forward or deflection to the dialplan extension for this
	  Dial() using a dialplan 'hint'. For example, some PSTNs do not
	  allow CallerID to be set to anything other than the numbers

	  | 29 lines Don't delay DTMF in core bridge while listening for
	  DTMF features This patch is mostly the work of Olle Johansson. I
	  did some cleanup and added the silence generating code if
	  transmit_silence is set. When a channel listens for DTMF in the
	  core bridge, the outbound DTMF is not sent until we have received
	  DTMF_END. For a long DTMF, this is a disaster. We send 4 seconds
	  of DTMF to Asterisk, which sends no audio for those 4 seconds.
	  Some products see this delay and the time skew on RTP packets
	  that results and start ignoring the audio that is sent afterward.
	  With this change, the DTMF_BEGIN frame is inspected and checked.
	  If it matches a feature code, we wait for DTMF_END and activate
	  the feature as before. If transmit_silence=yes in asterisk.conf,
	  silence is sent if we paritally match a multi-digit feature. If
	  it doesn't match a feature, the frame is forwarded along with the
	  DTMF_END without delay. By doing it this way, DTMF is not
	  delayed. (closes issue #15642) Reported by: jasonshugart Patches:

	  | 31 lines Add AELSub, which provides a stable entry point into
	  AEL subroutines. This commit needs some explanation, given that
	  we're adding a new application into an existing release branch.
	  This is generally a violation of our release policy, except in
	  very limited circumstances, and I believe this is one of those
	  circumstances. The problem that this solves is one of the sanity
	  of using multiple dialplan languages to define a dialplan. In the
	  case of the reporter, he or she is using AEL is define
	  subroutines, while using Realtime extensions to invoke those
	  subroutines. While you can do this, it's based upon the reality
	  of AEL using actual dialplan extensions; however, there is no
	  guarantee that the details of _how_ AEL is compiled into
	  extensions will remain stable. In fact, at the time of this
	  commit, it has already changed twice, once in a fundamental way.
	  Now normally, a new application would only be added to trunk.
	  However, this application is explicitly to create a stable
	  user-level API between versions, and adding it to trunk only will
	  not solve the user's problem of switching between 1.6.2 and 1.8,
	  nor will it help anybody switching from 1.8 to 1.10. Therefore,
	  it needs to go into existing release branches. For the sake of
	  consistency, and also because one of the changes was between 1.4
	  and 1.6.x, I am also electing to commit this to 1.4. (closes

	  'native', which causes the compiler to optimize the build for the
	  CPU the compile is performed on. Since most people are building
	  Asterisk on the machine they plan to run it on, the configure
	  script and build system will now use this value unless a
	  different value is specified by the user in CFLAGS when the
	  configure script is executed. In addition, this value will be
	  used for building the GSM and LPC10 codecs as well, in preference
	  to the logic that has been in their Makefiles forever to optimize
	  for certain types of CPUs.

	  | 46 lines Get real channel of a DAHDI call. Starting with
	  Asterisk v1.8, the DAHDI channel name format was changed for ISDN
	  calls to: DAHDI/i<span>/<number>[:<subaddress>]-<sequence-number>
	  There were several reasons that the channel name had to change.
	  1) Call completion requires a device state for ISDN phones. The
	  generic device state uses the channel name. 2) Calls do not
	  necessarily have B channels. Calls placed on hold by an ISDN
	  phone do not have B channels. 3) The B channel a call initially
	  requests may not be the B channel the call ultimately uses.
	  Changes to the internal implementation of the Asterisk master
	  channel list caused deadlock problems for chan_dahdi if it needed
	  to change the channel name. Chan_dahdi no longer changes the
	  channel name. 4) DTMF attended transfers now work with ISDN
	  phones because the channel name is "dialable" like the chan_sip
	  channel names. For various reasons, some people need to know
	  which B channel a DAHDI call is using. * Added
	  CHANNEL(dahdi_span), CHANNEL(dahdi_channel), and
	  CHANNEL(dahdi_type) so the dialplan can determine the B channel
	  currently in use by the channel. Use CHANNEL(no_media_path) to
	  determine if the channel even has a B channel. * Added AMI event
	  DAHDIChannel to associate a DAHDI channel with an Asterisk
	  channel so AMI applications can passively determine the B channel
	  currently in use. Calls with "no-media" as the DAHDIChannel do
	  not have an associated B channel. No-media calls are either on
	  hold or call-waiting. (closes issue #17683) Reported by: mrwho

	  possible sample rate. This allows for conferences to take
	  advantage of HD audio (Which sounds awesome) 8. Audiohooks are no
	  longer limited to 8khz audio, and most effects have been updated
	  to take advantage of this such as Volume, DENOISE, PITCH_SHIFT.

	  Feb 2011) | 37 lines No response sent for SIP CC
	  subscribe/resubscribe request. Asterisk does not send a response
	  if we try to subscribe for call completion after we have received
	  a 180 Ringing. You can only subscribe for call completion when
	  the call has been cleared. When we receive the 180 Ringing, for
	  this call, its call-completion state is 'CC_AVAILABLE'. If we
	  then send a subscribe message to Asterisk, it trys to change the
	  call-completion state to 'CC_CALLER_REQUESTED'. Because this is
	  an invalid state change, it just ignores the message. The only
	  state Asterisk will accept our subscribe message is in the
	  'CC_CALLER_OFFERED' state. Asterisk will go into the
	  'CC_CALLER_OFFERED' when the SIP client clears the call by
	  sending a CANCEL. Asterisk should always send a response. Even if
	  its a negative one. The fix is to allow for the CCSS core to
	  notify a CC agent that a failure has occurred when CC is
	  requested. The "ack" callback is replaced with a "respond"
	  callback. The "respond" callback has a parameter indicating
	  either a successful response or a specific type of failure that
	  may need to be communicated to the requester. (closes issue

	  ceased to work. A bug in AEL did not distinguish between the "s"
	  extension generated by AEL and an "s" extension that was required
	  to exist by the chan_dahdi (or another channel) that was not
	  supplied with a starting extension. Therefore, AEL made incorrect
	  assumptions about what commands were permissable in the context.
	  This was fixed by making AEL generate a different extension name.
	  However, Dial and Queue make additional assumptions about the
	  name of the default gosub extension. Therefore, they needed to be
	  brought into line with a "macro" rendered by AEL (as a gosub),
	  without breaking traditional dialplans written without the aid of

	  dialog Asterisk currently accepts a REFER with a Refer-To with an
	  embedded Replaces header that matches the dialog of the REFER.
	  This would be a situation like A calls B, A calls C, A transfers
	  B to A, which is just silly. This patch makes the transfer fail
	  instead of making Asterisk freak out and forget to hang other
	  channels up. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1093/

	  name updates (FACILITY/NOTIFY as appropriate). * Pass arbitrary
	  display text during a call. Sent in INFORMATION messages.
	  Received from any message that the display text was not used as a
	  name. If the display options are not set then the options default
	  to legacy behavior. The arbitrary display text is exchanged
	  between bridged channels using the AST_FRAME_TEXT frame type. To
	  send display text from the dialplan use the SendText()
	  application when the arbitrary display text option is enabled.

	  format_cap APIs. Functionally no change in behavior should be
	  present in this patch. Thanks to twilson and russell for all the

	  case of an attended transfer (A calls B, A atxfers to C) where A
	  becomes unreachable before replying to Asterisk's BYE, Asterisk
	  can sometimes retransmit the BYE indefinitely. This is because
	  __sip_autodestruct tests p->refer && !ast_test_flag(&p->flags[0],

	  __sip_autodestruct is called again, we end up starting the cycle
	  over. This patch adds a call to sip_alreadygone(pkt->owner) in

	  prevent Asterisk from trying to transmit new BYE messages in the

	  | 31 lines Fix channel redirect out of MeetMe() and other issues
	  with channel softhangup. Mantis issue #18585 reports that a
	  channel redirect out of MeetMe() stopped working properly. This
	  issue includes a patch that resolves the issue by removing a call
	  to ast_check_hangup() from app_meetme.c. I left that in my patch,
	  as it doesn't need to be there. However, the rest of the patch
	  fixes this problem with or without the change to app_meetme. The
	  key difference between what happens before and after this patch
	  is the effect of the END_OF_Q control frame. After END_OF_Q is
	  hit in ast_read(), ast_read() will return NULL. With the
	  ast_check_hangup() removed, app_meetme sees this which causes it
	  to exit as intended. Checking ast_check_hangup() caused
	  app_meetme to exit earlier in the process, and the target of the
	  redirect saw the condition where ast_read() returned NULL.
	  Removing ast_check_hangup() works around the issue in app_meetme,
	  but doesn't solve the issue if another application did the same
	  thing. There are also other edge cases where if an application
	  finishes at the same time that a redirect happens, the target of
	  the redirect will think that the channel hung up. So, I made some
	  changes in pbx.c to resolve it at a deeper level. There are
	  already places that unset the SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO flag in an
	  attempt to abort the hangup process. My patch extends this to
	  remove the END_OF_Q frame from the channel's read queue, making
	  the "abort hangup" more complete. This same technique was used in
	  every place where a softhangup flag was cleared. (closes issue

	* configure, configure.ac: Really use llvm-gcc, when available.

	* funcs/func_db.c, CHANGES: Add DB_KEYS. Discussion on #asterisk on
	  2011-01-19: (02:07:03 PM) boch: i wonder how to cycle all entries
	  in a tree (02:07:11 PM) leifmadsen: use While() (02:07:17 PM)
	  leifmadsen: you need to know the tree structure already though
	  (02:07:36 PM) boch: what you mean? (02:09:02 PM) leifmadsen: you
	  need to know the structure prior to looping, because you can't
	  just return the structure from the dialplan (02:09:43 PM)
	  leifmadsen: the only way I can think of doing that is via
	  something like writing the output of: asterisk -rx "database
	  show" to a file, then looping through that to know the structure
	  of the database and check everything (02:09:59 PM) leifmadsen:
	  but at that point you're better off just using either a
	  relational database or an external script (02:10:13 PM) boch: for
	  example i need to know all entries in the tree (02:10:15 PM)

	  leifmadsen: that's the problem (02:10:22 PM) boch: thank you
	  (02:13:09 PM) mateu: yeah, i'm surprised there isn't something
	  from the dialplan like 'database show family' so one can get all
	  keys in a family to loop over. (02:15:35 PM) leifmadsen: database
	  shows everything (02:16:22 PM) mateu: i mean something from the
	  dial plan that mimics 'database show <family>' (02:16:41 PM)
	  leifmadsen: guess no one has found that important enough to
	  program :) (02:16:52 PM) leifmadsen: at that point you should
	  probably just use a relational database... (02:17:10 PM) mateu: i
	  dunno (02:17:16 PM) mateu: seems pretty basic to me. (02:17:16

	  at least we know how it currently stands. thanks leifmadsen
	  (02:28:52 PM) Corydon76-home: leifmadsen: something like
	  HASHKEYS() ? (02:30:11 PM) leifmadsen: Corydon76-home: ummm, I
	  was thinking more like DUNDI_QUERY() and DUNDI_RESULT() (02:30:31
	  PM) leifmadsen: although HASHKEYS() might work (02:30:58 PM)
	  leifmadsen: actually ya, looking at it, similar to HASHKEYS()
	  (02:31:01 PM) leifmadsen: DBKEYS() I guess? (02:31:45 PM)
	  Corydon76-home: So with no argument, retrieves families, with an
	  argument, retrieves keys of that family? (02:34:02 PM)
	  leifmadsen: ya (02:34:16 PM) leifmadsen: how would you iterate
	  through layers of them? (02:34:30 PM) leifmadsen: i.e.
	  family/key/key/key ? (02:34:43 PM) Corydon76-home: Essentially,

	  | 88 lines Issues with DTMF triggered attended transfers. Issue
	  #17999 1) A calls B. B answers. 2) B using DTMF dial *2 (code in
	  features.conf for attended transfer). 3) A hears MOH. B dial
	  number C 4) C ringing. A hears MOH. 5) B hangup. A still hears
	  MOH. C ringing. 6) A hangup. C still ringing until
	  "atxfernoanswertimeout" expires. For v1.4 C will ring forever
	  until C answers the dead line. (Issue #17096) Problem: When A and
	  B hangup, C is still ringing. Issue #18395 SIP call limit of B is
	  1 1. A call B, B answered 2. B *2(atxfer) call C 3. B hangup, C
	  ringing 4. Timeout waiting for C to answer 5. Recall to B fails
	  because B has reached its call limit. Because B reached its call
	  limit, it cannot do anything until the transfer it started
	  completes. Issue #17273 Same scenario as issue 18395 but party B
	  is an FXS port. Party B cannot do anything until the transfer it
	  started completes. If B goes back off hook before C answers, B
	  hears ringback instead of the expected dialtone. ********** Note
	  for the issue #17273 and #18395 fix: DTMF attended transfer works
	  within the channel bridge. Unfortunately, when either party A or
	  B in the channel bridge hangs up, that channel is not completely
	  hung up until the transfer completes. This is a real problem
	  depending upon the channel technology involved. For chan_dahdi,
	  the channel is crippled until the hangup is complete. Either the
	  channel is not useable (analog) or the protocol disconnect
	  messages are held up (PRI/BRI/SS7) and the media is not released.
	  For chan_sip, a call limit of one is going to block that endpoint
	  from any further calls until the hangup is complete. For party A
	  this is a minor problem. The party A channel will only be in this
	  condition while party B is dialing and when party B and C are
	  conferring. The conversation between party B and C is expected to
	  be a short one. Party B is either asking a question of party C or
	  announcing party A. Also party A does not have much incentive to
	  hangup at this point. For party B this can be a major problem
	  during a blonde transfer. (A blonde transfer is our term for an
	  attended transfer that is converted into a blind transfer. :))
	  Party B could be the operator. When party B hangs up, he assumes
	  that he is out of the original call entirely. The party B channel
	  will be in this condition while party C is ringing, while
	  attempting to recall party B, and while waiting between call
	  attempts. WARNING: The ATXFER_NULL_TECH conditional is a hack to
	  fix the problem. It will replace the party B channel technology
	  with a NULL channel driver to complete hanging up the party B
	  channel technology. The consequences of this code is that the 'h'
	  extension will not be able to access any channel technology
	  specific information like SIP statistics for the call.
	  ATXFER_NULL_TECH is not defined by default. ********** (closes

	  reworks how this is done and just allows you to optionally start
	  a thread on the original scheduler context structure that has
	  always been there. This makes it trivial to switch to the generic
	  scheduler thread implementation without having to touch any of
	  the other code that adds or removes scheduler entries. In
	  passing, I made some naming tweaks to add ast_ prefixes where
	  they were not there before. Review:

	  | 23 lines Fix not stopping MOH when transfered local channel
	  queue member is answered. The problem here is only present when
	  local channels are used with the MOH passthru option as well as
	  no optimization (/nm). I will describe the slightly bizarre
	  scenario that was used to test, where phones B and C are queue
	  members: Phone A dials into a queue with two members using local
	  channels and the above options. Phone B answers. Phone A blind
	  transfers phone B into the same queue. Phone A hangs up. Phone C
	  answers, but phone B didn't stop playing MOH. In this scenario,
	  the unhold frame that should have gotten to phone B never arrived
	  due to the masquerade from the blind transfer. This is usually
	  fine since app_queue manages the starting and stopping of MOH.
	  However, with the passthrough option enabled when app_queue
	  attempts to stop MOH it tries to do so on the local channel
	  rather than the real channel. The easiest solution was to just
	  make sure to send an unhold frame during the transfer since it
	  wouldn't make sense to have MOH playing after a transfer anyway.
	  This only modifies SIP transfers, but the other transfers did not
	  seem to be a problem. If DTMF based transfers were a problem it
	  might be okay to add ast_moh_stop to finishup, but I didn't want
	  to have to add that unless required. ABE-2624 ........

	  | 43 lines Oneway audio to SIP phone from FXS port after FXS port
	  gets a CallWaiting pip. The FXS connected phone has to have
	  CW/CID support to fail, as it will send back a DTMF 'A' or 'D'
	  when it's ready to receive CallerID. A normal phone with no CID
	  never fails. Also the SIP phone does not hear MOH when the CW
	  call is answered. The DTMF end frame is suppressed when the phone
	  acknowledges the CW signal for CID. The problem is the DTMF begin
	  frame needs to be suppressed as well. The DTMF begin frame is
	  causing SIP to start sending the DTMF RTP frames. Since the DTMF
	  end frame is suppressed, SIP will not stop sending those DTMF RTP
	  packets. * Suppress the DTMF begin and end frames when the
	  channel driver is looking for DTMF digits. * Fixed a couple
	  issues caused by not cleaning up the CID spill if you answer the
	  CW call while it is sending the CID spill. * Fixed not sending
	  CW/CID spill to the phone when the call is natively bridged.
	  (Fixed by not using native bridge if CW/CID is possible.) *
	  Suppress received audio when sending CW/CID spills. The other
	  parties involved do not need to hear the CW/CID spills and may be
	  confused if the CW call is for them. (closes issue #18129)

	  NOTE: * v1.4 does not have the main problem fixed by suppressing
	  the DTMF start frames. The other three items fixed are relevant.
	  * If you really must restore native bridging between analog
	  ports, you need to disable CW/CID either by configuring
	  chan_dahdi.conf callwaitingcallerid=no or dialing *70 before
	  dialing the number to temporarily disable CW. ........

	  the case that the native format was able to be changed to match
	  the new requested format, the code proceeded to attempt to build

	  thinking an error has occurred. This case is now specifically

	  | 38 lines Handle failures building translation paths more
	  effectively. The problem scenario occurred on a heavily loaded
	  system that was using the codec_dahdi module and exceeded the
	  hardware transcoding capacity. The failure mode at that point was
	  not good. The report came in to us as an Asterisk lock-up. The
	  "core show locks" shows a ton of threads locked up (but no
	  obvious deadlock). Upon deeper investigation, when the system is
	  in this state, the CPU was maxed out. The CPU was being consumed
	  by the Asterisk logger spewing messages on every audio frame for
	  calls set up after transcoder capacity was reached. The purpose
	  of this patch is to make Asterisk handle failures to create a
	  translation path in a more graceful manner. If we can't
	  translate, then the call just needs to be dropped, as it's not
	  going to work. These are the changes: 1) In set_format() of
	  channel.c (which is called by set_read_format() and
	  set_write_format()), it was ignoring if
	  ast_translator_build_path() failed and returned NULL. It now pays
	  attention to that case and returns a result reflecting failure.
	  With this change in place, the bridging code will immediately
	  detect a failure and end the bridge instead of proceeding to try
	  to bridge frames that can't be translated and making channel
	  drivers freak out by sending them frames in a format they weren't
	  expecting. 2) In ast_indicate_data() of channel.c, failure of
	  ast_playtones_start() was ignored. It is now reflected in the
	  return value of the function. This didn't turn out to have any
	  affect on the bug, but seemed like a good change to leave in. 3)
	  In app_dial(), when only sending a call to a single endpoint, it
	  will attempt to do some bridging of its own of early audio. It
	  uses make_compatible() when it's going to do this. However, it
	  ignored failure from make compatible. So, even with the fix from
	  #1, if there was early audio going through app_dial, there would
	  still be a period of invalid frames passing through. After
	  detecting failure here, Dial() exits. ABE-2658 ........

	  | 46 lines The channel redirect function (CLI or AMI) hangs up
	  the call instead of redirecting the call. To recreate the
	  problem: 1) Party A calls Party B 2) Invoke CLI "channel
	  redirect" command to redirect channel call leg associated with A.
	  3) All associated channels are hung up. Note that if the CLI
	  command were done on the channel call leg associated with B it
	  works. This regression was a result of the fix for issue #16946
	  (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/740/). The regression affects
	  all features that use an async goto to execute the dialplan
	  because of an external event: Channel redirect, AMI redirect, SIP
	  REFER, and FAX detection. The struct ast_channel._softhangup code
	  is a mess. The variable is used for several purposes that do not
	  necessarily result in the call being hung up. I have added
	  doxygen comments to describe how the various _softhangup bits are
	  used. I have corrected all the places where the variable was
	  tested in a non-bit oriented manner. The primary fix is the new
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q frame. It acts as a weak hangup request so
	  the soft hangup requests that do not normally result in a hangup
	  do not hangup. JIRA SWP-2470 JIRA SWP-2489 (closes issue #18171)

	  | 29 lines Fix cache of device state changes for multiple
	  servers. This patch addresses a regression where device states
	  across multiple servers were not being processing completely
	  correctly. The code works to determine the overall state by
	  looking at the last known state of a device on each server.
	  However, there was a regression due to some invasive rewrites of
	  how the cache works that led to the cache only storing the last
	  device state change for a device, regardless of which server it
	  was on. The code is set up to cache device state change events by
	  ensuring that each event in the cache has a unique device name +
	  entity ID (server ID). The code that was responsible for
	  comparing raw information elements (which EID is) always returned
	  a match due to a memcmp() with a length of 0. There isn't much
	  code to fix the actual bug. This patch also introduces a new CLI
	  command that was very useful for debugging this problem. The
	  command allows you to dump the contents of the event cache.

	  peers never stopping. The option packets not only never stopped,
	  but if a realtime peer was not in the peer list multiple options
	  dialogs could accumulate over time. This scenario has the
	  potential to progress to the point of saturating a link just from
	  options packets. The fix was to ensure that the poke scheduler
	  checks to see if a peer is in the peer list before continuing to
	  poke. The reason a peer must be in the peer list to be able to
	  properly manage an options dialog is because otherwise the call
	  pointer is lost when the peer is regenerated from the database,
	  which is how existing qualify dialogs are detected. (closes issue

	  member in chan_list is shaky at best. It is set if the incoming
	  and outgoing call legs are mISDN. The use of the other_ch member
	  goes against the Asterisk architecture and can even cause
	  problems. 1) It is used to disable echo cancellation. This could
	  be bad if the call is forked and the winning call leg is not
	  mISDN or the winning call leg is not the last mISDN channel
	  called by the fork. The other_ch would become a dangling pointer.
	  2) It is used when the far end is alerting to hear the far end's
	  inband audio instead of Asterisk's generated ringback tone. This
	  is bad if the call is forked. You would only hear the last forked
	  mISDN channel and it may not be ringing yet. The other_ch would
	  become a dangling pointer if the call is later transferred.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Perform proper handling of forked outbound
	  INVITE requests. RFC3261 section 12 about dialog creation says an
	  INVITE transaction results in an established dialog once it
	  receives the 200 OK response. It is possible to receive multiple
	  differing 200 OK responses for a single outbound INVITE Request,
	  and this should result in establishing multiple dialogs. This
	  patch allows for all differing 200 OK responses to an INVITE
	  request to establish a separate dialog, but only the first dialog
	  is kept. All other resulting dialogs from the initial request are
	  immediately ACKed and then immediately terminated with a BYE
	  request. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/946/

	  | 17 lines codecs/codec_dahdi: Prevent "choppy" audio when
	  receiving unexpected frame sizes. dahdi-linux 2.4.0 (specifically
	  commit 9034) added the capability for the wctc4xxp to return more
	  than a single packet of data in response to a read. However, when
	  decoding packets, codec_dahdi was still assuming that the default
	  number of samples was in each read. In other words, each packet
	  your provider sent you, regardless of size, would result in 20 ms
	  of decoded data (30 ms if decoding G723). If your provider was
	  sending 60 ms packets then codec_dahdi would end up stripping 40
	  ms of data from each transcoded frame resulting in "choppy"
	  audio. This would only affect systems where G729 packets are
	  arriving in sizes greater than 20ms or G723 packets arriving in
	  sizes greater than 30ms. DAHDI-744. ........ ................

	  | 25 lines Avoid valgrind warnings for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_xxx_address The documentation for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_(local/remote)_address stated that they
	  returned 0 for success and -1 on failure. Instead, they returned
	  0 if the address structure passed in was already equivalent to
	  the address instance local/remote address or 1 otherwise. 90% of
	  the calls to these functions completely ignored the return
	  address and passed in an uninitialized struct, which would make
	  valgrind complain even though the operation was technically safe.
	  This patch fixes the documentation and converts the
	  get_xxx_address functions to void since all they really do is
	  copy the address and cannot fail. Additionally two new functions
	  (ast_rtp_instance_get_and_cmp_(local/remote)_address) are created
	  for the 3 times where the return value was actually checked. The
	  get_and_cmp_local_address function is currently unused, but
	  exists for the sake of symmetry. The only functional change as a
	  result of this change is that we will not do an
	  ast_sockaddr_cmp() on (mostly uninitialized) addresses before
	  doing the ast_sockaddr_copy() in the get_*_address functions. So,
	  even though it is an API change, it shouldn't have a noticeable
	  change in behavior. Review:

	  messages per folder to not be respected when simultaneously
	  leaving multiple voicemails just below the threshold. These
	  problems should be fixed by the above, but just in case: Fixed
	  resequence_mailbox to rely on the actual number of detected
	  number of files in a directory rather than just assuming only 10
	  messages more than the maximum had been left. Also if more
	  messages than the maximum are deleted they are actually removed
	  now. The second purpose of this commit should have been separated
	  out probably, but is related to the above. Again, if the number
	  of messages in a given voicemail folder exceeds the maximum set
	  limit make sure to allocate enough space for the deleted and
	  heard index tracking array. A few random fixes: There was a
	  forgotten decrement of the inprocess count in imap_store_file.
	  When using IMAP storage, do not look in the directory where file
	  based storage messages may still reside and influence the message
	  count. Ensure to use only the first format in sendmail. ABE-2516

	  | 27 lines This patch turns chan_local pvts into astobj2 objects.
	  chan_local does some dangerous things involving deadlock
	  avoidance. tech_pvt functions like hangup and queue_frame are
	  provided with a locked channel upon entry. Those functions are
	  completely safe as long as you don't attempt to give up that
	  channel lock, but that is impossible to guarantee due to the
	  required deadlock avoidance necessary to lock both the tech_pvt
	  and both channels involved. In the past, we have tried to account
	  for this by doing things like setting a "glare" flag that
	  indicates what function should destroy the pvt. This was used in
	  local_hangup and local_queue_frame to decided who should destroy
	  the pvt if they collided in separate threads. I have removed the
	  need to do this by converting all chan_local tech_pvts to
	  astobj2. This means we can ref a pvt before deadlock avoidance
	  and not have to worry about that pvt possibly getting destroyed
	  under us. It also cleans up where we destroy the tech_pvt. The
	  only unlink from the tech_pvt container occurs in local_hangup
	  now, which is where it should occur. Since there still may be
	  thread collisions on some functions like local_hangup after
	  deadlock avoidance, I have added some checks to detect those
	  collisions and exit appropriately. I think this patch is going to
	  solve quite a bit of weirdness we have had with local channels in
	  the past. ........ ................ ................

	  | 45 lines Add TLS cert helper script This script is useful for
	  quickly generating self-signed CA, server, and client
	  certificates for use with Asterisk. It is still recommended to
	  obtain certificates from a recognized Certificate Authority and
	  to develop an understanding how SSL certificates work. Real
	  security is hard work. OPTIONS: -h Show this message -m Type of
	  cert "client" or "server". Defaults to server. -f Config filename
	  (openssl config file format) -c CA cert filename (creates new CA
	  cert/key as ca.crt/ca.key if not passed) -k CA key filename -C
	  Common name (cert field) For a server cert, this should be the
	  same address that clients attempt to connect to. Usually this
	  will be the Fully Qualified Domain Name, but might be the IP of
	  the server. For a CA or client cert, it is merely informational.
	  Make sure your certs have unique common names. -O Org name (cert
	  field) An informational string (company name) -o Output filename
	  base (defaults to asterisk) -d Output directory (defaults to the
	  current directory) Example: To create a CA and a server
	  (pbx.mycompany.com) cert with output in /tmp: ast_tls_cert -C
	  pbx.mycompany.com -O "My Company" -d /tmp This will create a CA
	  cert and key as well as asterisk.pem and the the two files that
	  it is made from: asterisk.crt and asterisk.key. Copy asterisk.pem
	  and ca.crt somewhere (like /etc/asterisk) and set
	  tlscertfile=/etc/asterisk.pem and tlscafile=/etc/ca.crt. Since
	  this is a self-signed key, many devices will require you to
	  import the ca.crt file as a trusted cert. To create a client cert
	  using the CA cert created by the example above: ast_tls_cert -m
	  client -c /tmp/ca.crt -k /tmp/ca.key -C "Joe User" -O \ "My
	  Company" -d /tmp -o joe_user This will create client.crt/key/pem
	  in /tmp. Use this if your device supports a client certificate.
	  Make sure that you have the ca.crt file set up as a tlscafile in
	  the necessary Asterisk configs. Make backups of all .key files in
	  case you need them later. ........

	  should be much safer now. We now treat all clients types the

	  modified how the local ip is found. If no bindaddress is provided
	  in the config file, we attempt to determine the local ip we would
	  use to connect to google.com. If that fails, then we fall back to
	  the ast_find_ourip() function as a last resort. Using the new
	  method makes it much less likely that we would ever advertise a
	  local RTP candidate as a loopback address. ........

	  | 21 lines Don't ignore frames that have been queued when
	  softhangup'd When an outgoing call is answered and hung up by the
	  far end *very* quickly, we may not read any frames and therefor
	  end up with a call that displays the wrong
	  disposition/DIALSTATUS. The reason is because ast_queue_hangup()
	  immediately sets the _softhangup flag on the channel and then
	  queues the HANGUP control frame, but __ast_read refuses to read
	  any frames if ast_check_hangup() indicates that a hangup request
	  has been made (which it will if _softhangup is set). So, we end
	  up losing control frames. This change makes __ast_read continue
	  to read frames even if a soft hangup has been requested. It
	  queues a hangup frame to make sure that __ast_read() will still
	  eventually return NULL. Much thanks to David Vossel for all of

	  patch includes several chan_gtalk enhancements. Two new
	  gtalk.conf options have been added, externip and stunadd. Setting
	  externip allows us to manually specify what the external IP
	  address is outside of a NAT environment. Setting the stunaddr
	  option to a valid stun server allows for that external ip to be
	  retrieved via a STUN server automatically. This external IP is
	  then advertised during call setup as a possible candidate. I have
	  also attempted to clean up chan_gtalk's code so it meets our
	  coding guidelines. During this cleanup I noticed several things
	  that need to be done in the code and made a TODO section at the
	  top of the file. ........

	  Outbound DTMF with gtalk needs to be done within the RTP stream.
	  I discovered this after investigating a packet capture from the
	  gmail client. Instead of performing jingle signaling DTMF, the
	  gtalk servers expect all DTMF to arrive on the RTP stream using
	  RFC2833 way of doing things. Chan_gtalk also had an issue with
	  negotiating RTP payload type 106 for the telephony-event and then
	  sending DTMF as payload 101. This has been resolved by always
	  negotiating 101 as the payload type like we do everywhere else.
	  With this patch, incoming google voice calls forwarded to
	  Asterisk via gtalk work. ........

	  | 15 lines Change RFC2833 DTMF event duration on end to report
	  actual elapsed time. The scenario here is with a non P2P early
	  media session. The reported time length of DTMF presses are
	  coming up short when sending to the remote side. Currently the
	  event duration is a running total that is incremented when
	  sending continuation packets. These continuation packets are only
	  triggered upon incoming media from the remote side, which means
	  that the running total probably is not going to end up matching
	  the actual length of time Asterisk received DTMF. This patch
	  changes the end event duration to be lengthened if it is detected
	  that the end event is going to come up short. Review:

	  ast_bridged_channel() on an unlocked channel. Near the beginning

	  held there either. Converted the existing channel deadlock
	  avoidance to use iax2_lock_owner(). Using the new function
	  simplified some awkward code. In the process of fixing the
	  locking on ast_bridged_channel(), I also found a memory leak in
	  socket_process() for v1.6.2 and v1.8. The local struct variable

	  | 21 lines Addition of the FrameHook API (AKA AwesomeHooks) So
	  far all our tools for viewing and manipulating media streams
	  within Asterisk have been entirely focused on audio. That made
	  sense then, but is not scalable now. The FrameHook API lets us
	  tap into and manipulate _ANY_ type of media or signaling passed
	  on a channel present today or in the future. This tool is a step
	  in the direction of expanding Asterisk's boundaries and will help
	  generate some rather interesting applications in the future. In
	  addition to the FrameHook API, a simple dialplan function
	  exercising the api has been included as well. This function is
	  called FRAME_TRACE(). FRAME_TRACE() allows for the internal
	  ast_frames read and written to a channel to be output. Filters
	  can be placed on this function to debug only certain types of
	  frames. This function could be thought of as an internal way of
	  doing ast_frame packet captures. Review:

	  unfortunately can handle these information elements only in a

	  | 54 lines Fixes interoperability problems with session timer
	  behavior in Asterisk. CHANGES: 1. Never put "timer" in "Require"
	  header. This is not to our benefit and RFC 4028 section 7.1 even
	  warns against it. It is possible for one endpoint to perform
	  session-timer refreshes while the other endpoint does not support
	  them. If in this case the end point performing the refreshing
	  puts "timer" in the Require field during a refresh, the dialog
	  will likely get terminated by the other end. 2. Change the
	  behavior of 'session-timer=accept' in sip.conf (which is the
	  default behavior of Asterisk with no session timer configuration
	  specified) to only run session-timers as result of an incoming
	  INVITE request if the INVITE contains an "Session-Expires"
	  header... Asterisk is currently treating having the "timer"
	  option in the "Supported" header as a request for session timers
	  by the UAC. I do not agree with this. Session timers should only
	  be negotiated in "accept" mode when the incoming INVITE supplies
	  a "Session-Expires" header, otherwise RFC 4028 says we should
	  treat a request containing no "Session-Expires" header as a
	  session with no expiration. Below I have outlined some situations
	  and what Asterisk's behavior is. The table reflects the behavior
	  changes implemented by this patch. SITUATIONS: -Asterisk as UAS
	  1. Incoming INVITE: NO "Session-Expires" 2. Incoming INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires" -Asterisk as UAC 3. Outgoing INVITE: NO
	  "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response HAS "Session-Expires" header
	  4. Outgoing INVITE: NO "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response NO
	  "Session-Expires" header 5. Outgoing INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires". Active - Asterisk will have an active refresh
	  timer regardless if the other endpoint does. Inactive - Asterisk
	  does not have an active refresh timer regardless if the other
	  endpoint does. XXXXXXX - Not possible for mode.

	  | 19 lines Fixed how Asterisk destroys a dialog on channel hangup
	  before invite receives a response. If an ast_channel with a SIP
	  tech pvt hangs up before the sip dialog gets a response to its
	  outgoing INVITE, Asterisk used to pretend_ack the INVITE. This is
	  not rfc compliant and results in confusion at the other endpoint.
	  sip_pretend_ack will ack and remove all the packets in the
	  retransmit queue. This means that the INVITE will stop
	  retransmitting, and that any response to that INVITE that comes
	  after the pretend_ack occurs will be ignored. Instead of faking
	  any sort of acknowledgement for an outgoing INVITE during an
	  internal hangup, we should let the protocol stack process the
	  INVITE transaction and terminate the dialog properly. This is
	  achieved by setting the PENDING_BYE flag. When this flag is used,
	  once the dialog proceeds to an escapable state the transaction
	  will either be canceled with a SIP_CANCEL or completed followed
	  immediately by a BYE. Attempting to do this any other way is
	  incorrect. If the endpoint is not responding to the INVITE
	  request, the INVITE must continue to be retransmitted until it
	  times out which will result in the dialog being destroyed.

	  | 11 lines This fix makes sure the ast_channel hangs up correctly
	  when the dialog's PENDING_BYE flag is set. When the pending bye
	  flag is used, it is possible that the dialog will terminate and
	  leave the sip_pvt->owner channel up. This is because we never
	  hangup the ast_channel after sending the SIP_BYE request. When we
	  receive the response for the SIP_BYE we set need_destroy which we
	  would expect to destroy the dialog on the next do_monitor loop,
	  but this is not the case. The dialog will only be destroyed once
	  the owner is hungup even with the need_destroy flag set. This
	  patch sets the softhangup flag on the ast_channel when a SIP_BYE
	  request is sent as a result of the pending bye flag. ........

	  | 16 lines only do magic pickup when notifycid is enabled A new
	  way of doing BLF pickup was introduced into 1.6.2. This feature
	  adds a call-id value into the XML of a SIP_NOTIFY message sent to
	  alert a subscriber that a device is ringing. This option should
	  only be enabled when the new 'notifycid' option is set... but
	  this was not the case. Instead the call-id value was included for
	  every RINGING Notify message, which caused a regression for
	  people who used other methods for call pickup. (closes issue

	  | 35 lines improved translation paths for wideband codecs The
	  problem I'm addressing is that Asterisk's current method of
	  building the least cost translation paths between codecs does not
	  take into account sample rate. For instance, it was possible for
	  siren14 (a 32khz codec), to contain the a translation path to
	  siren7 (a 16khz audio codec) that goes through slin at 8khz. In
	  this case Asterisk takes a 32khz codec, down samples it to 8khz
	  and then up samples it to 16khz which is terrible regardless if
	  it is computationally less expensive. This patch now builds
	  translation paths that give priority to maintaining the best
	  possible sample rate before taking into consideration
	  computational cost. This patch also adds cli commands to expose
	  what translation paths are actually being used. Changes: 1.
	  Translation paths will never contain a step that changes the
	  sample rate unless absolutely necessary. 2. When choosing the
	  best codec to make two channels compatible. Shared codecs with
	  the highest sample rate are given priority. 3. A new cli command
	  to show all translation paths available for a specific codec
	  'core show translation paths [codec name]' has been added. 4.
	  'core show translation' which displays the translation matrix now
	  includes the new higher bit audio codecs in the table. 5. 'core
	  show channel [channel name]' now displays the translation paths
	  if translation is used. (closes issue #16841) Reported by:

	  | 21 lines transaction matching using top most Via header This
	  patch modifies the way chan_sip.c does transaction to dialog
	  matching. Asterisk now stores information in the top most Via
	  header of the initial incoming request and compares that against
	  other Requests that have the same call-id. This results in
	  Asterisk being able to detect a forked call in which it has
	  received multiple legs of the fork. I completely stripped out the
	  previous matching code and made the comparisons a little more
	  explicit and easier to understand. My comments in the code should
	  offer all the details involving this patch. This patch also fixes
	  a bug with the usage of the OBJ-MULTIPLE flag to find multiple
	  dialogs with the same call-id. Since the callback function was
	  returning (CMP_MATCH | CMP_STOP) only the first item found was
	  being returned. I fixed this by making a new callback function
	  for finding multiple dialogs that only returns (CMP_MATCH) on a
	  match allowing for multiple items to be returned. Review:
