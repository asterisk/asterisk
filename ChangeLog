	* res_pjsip_registrar: lock transport monitor when setting 'removing' flag

	  A previous patch attempt to mitigate blocked threads on transport shutdown for
	  a given contact. It was thought that a second lock could be avoided by checking
	  the 'removing' flag on the transport monitor twice (once before and once after
	  the normal named aor locking). However as with usual threading issues if the
	  timing was right the original problem still occured.

	  This patch adds locking around the first 'removing' flag check and set, thus
	  nullifying the secondary check, so it was removed.

	* res_stasis: Auto-create context and extens on Stasis app launch.

	  At AstriCon, there was a strong desire for the ability to completely
	  bypass dialplan when using ARI. This is possible through the automatic
	  creation of a context and a couple of extensions whenever an application
	  is started.

	  For example, if you have an application named 'ari-example', a context
	  named 'stasis-ari-example' will be automatically created whenever this
	  application is started as long as one does not already exist. Two
	  extensions (a match-all extension for Stasis and a 'h' extension) are
	  created within this context. Any endpoint that registers to Asterisk
	  within this context will send all calls to the corresponding Stasis
	  application. When the application is destroyed, the context is removed.

	* media_index.c: Refactored so it doesn't cache the index

	  Testing revealed that the cache added no benefit but that it could
	  consume excessive memory.

	  Two new index related functions were created:
	  ast_sounds_get_index_for_file() and ast_media_index_update_for_file()
	  which restrict index updating to specific sound files.

	  The original ast_sounds_get_index() and ast_media_index_update()
	  calls are still available but since they no longer cache the results
	  internally, developers should re-use an index they may already have
	  instead of calling ast_sounds_get_index() repeatedly.  If information
	  for only a single file is needed, ast_sounds_get_index_for_file()
	  should be called instead of ast_sounds_get_index().

	  The media_index directory scan code was elimininated in favor of
	  using the existing ast_file_read_dirs() function.

	  Since there's no more cache, ast_sounds_index_init now only
	  registers the sounds cli commands instead of generating the
	  initial index and subscribing to stasis format register/unregister
	  messages.

	  "sounds" is no longer a valid target for the "module reload"
	  command.

	  Both the sounds cli commands and the sounds ari resources were
	  refactored to only call ast_sounds_get_index() once per invocation
	  and to use ast_sounds_get_index_for_file() when a specific sound
	  file is requested.

	* app_voicemail:  Add Mailbox Aliases

	  You can now define an "aliases" context in voicemail.conf
	  whose entries point to actual mailboxes.  These can be used anywhere
	  the mailbox is specified.

	  Example:
	  [general]
	  aliasescontext = myaliases

	  [default]
	  1234 = yadayada

	  [myaliases]
	  4321@devices = 1234@default

	  Now you can use 4321@devices to refer to the 1234@default mailbox.

	  This can be useful to provide channel drivers with constant
	  mailbox specifications such as <extension>@devices leaving
	  app_voicemail to control exactly which mailbox the alias points to.
	  Now, only voicemail has to be reloaded to make changes instead of
	  individual channel drivers which are usually more expensive to
	  reload.

	* res_pjsip_registrar: mitigate blocked threads on reliable transport shutdown

	  When a reliable transport is shutdown it's possible for the pjsip registrar
	  resource shutdown handler to get called multiple times. If this happens and one
	  of the threads is taking "too long" (slow database call for instance) then the
	  others get blocked waiting to delete.

	  Since it only takes one to delete the contact then the other threads should be
	  able to continue on if one of the threads is currently "deleting". This patch
	  makes it so now when a thread enters the shutdown handler it checks to see if a
	  thread is currently already "deleting". If so, then the thread does not attempt
	  to get the lock, and instead continues on thus avoiding the blockage.

	* pjsip_transport_management: Shutdown transport immediately on disconnect

	  The transport management code that checks for idle connections keeps a
	  reference to PJSIP's transport for IDLE_TIMEOUT milliseconds (32000 by
	  default). Because of this, if the transport is closed before this
	  timeout, the idle checking code will keep the transport from actually
	  being shutdown until the timeout expires.

	  Rather than passing the AO2 object to the scheduler task, we just pass
	  its key and look it up when it is time to potentially close the idle
	  connection. The other transport management code handles cleaning up
	  everything else for us.

	  Additionally, because we use the address of the transport when
	  generating its name, we concatenate an incrementing ID to the end of the
	  name to guarantee uniqueness.

	* stasis / manager / ari: Better filter messages.

	  Previously both AMI and ARI used a default route on
	  their stasis message router to handle some of the
	  messages for publishing out their respective
	  connection. This caused messages to be given to
	  their subscription that could not be formatted
	  into AMI or JSON.

	  This change adds an API call to the stasis message
	  router which allows a default route to be set as well
	  as formatters that the default route is expecting.
	  This allows both AMI and ARI to specify that their
	  default route only wants messages of their given
	  formatter. By doing so stasis can more intelligently
	  filter at publishing time so that they do not receive
	  messages which will not be turned into AMI or JSON.

	  option that also specified an alternation location for the pid file.

	  So now...

	  1. We find the asterisk executable with "which" or the --asterisk-bin
	     command line option.
	  2. If there's only 1 process with an executable path that matches,
	     we use that pid.  If not...
	  3. We try "<asterisk-bin> -rx 'core show settings'" and parse the
	     output to find the pidfile, then read that for the pid.  If that
	     didn't work...
	  4. We get a list of all the pids matching <asterisk-bin> and look
	     in /proc/<pid>/cmdline for a -C argument and retry the "core show
	     settings" using the same -C option.  We can't parse the output
	     of "ps" to get the -C path because it may contain spaces.  The
	     contents of /proc/<pid>/cmdline are delimited by NULLs.  For BSDs
	     we may have to mount /proc first. :(

	* app_voicemail:  Don't delete mailbox state unless mailbox is deleted

	  The free_user function was automatically deleting the stasis mailbox
	  state but this only makes sense when the mailbox is actually
	  deleted, not just the structure freed.  This was causing issues
	  where leave_voicemail would publish the mwi message to stasis and
	  delete the state before the message could be processed by
	  res_pjsip_mwi.

	  * Removed the delete of state from free_user().

	  * Created a new free_user_final() function that both frees the data
	    structure and deletes the state.  This function is only called
	    during module load/unload where it's appropriate to delete the
	    state.

	* backtrace:  Refactor ast_bt_get_symbols so it doesn't crash

	  We've been seeing crashes in libbfd when we attempt to generate
	  a stack trace from multiple threads.  It turns out that libbfd
	  is NOT thread-safe.  It can cache the bfd structure and give it to
	  multiple threads without protecting itself.  To get around this,
	  we've added a global mutex around the bfd functions and also have
	  refactored the use of those functions to be more efficient and
	  to provide more information about inlined functions.

	  Also added a few more tests to test_pbx.c.  One just calls
	  ast_assert() and the other calls ast_log_backtrace().  Neither are
	  run by default.

	  WARNING:  This change necessitated changing the return value of
	  ast_bt_get_symbols() from an array of strings to a VECTOR of
	  strings.  However, the use of this function outside Asterisk is not
	  likely.

	* CI:  Pass work directory to runTestsuite

	  The testsuite can now use a user-specified work directory for
	  all it's temp files.  This allows the docker containers to use
	  a tmpfs backed directory for the temp files instead of it's
	  own write-layer image.

	  * runTestsuite.sh now accepts a --work-dir command line argument
	    that gets exported as AST_WORK_DIR before running the testsuite.

	  * gates.jenkinsfile now specifies --work-dir to be
	    <testsuite_dir>/astroot.

	  Since the Asterisk CI docker hosts now mount /srv/jenkins/workspace
	  on a tmpfs, asterisk should be compiled and the testsuite run all in
	  memory.

	* CI: Allow runUnittests to use 'expect' to run the tests

	  There seems to be a race condition between starting the asterisk
	  daemon and attempting to use 'asterisk -r' that can cause the
	  control socket file to not be created.  Since all of the Jenkins
	  slaves have 'expect' installed, the runUnittests script can use
	  it to start asterisk in the forground and issue the commands
	  interactively.  This is much more reliable and it can also make
	  startup errors more visible since they'll be in the Jenkins console
	  output.

	  If 'expect' isn't installed, the original daemon/asterisk -r
	  process is used.

	  Also added a "core show settings" before running the tests
	  and added "notice,warning,error" to the console log.

	  When dn_expand was being called on SRV and NAPTR results, the

	  needed to store the host names.  Since dn_expand returns the
	  length of the COMPRESSED name the buffer could be too short

	  so using strlen() is the correct way to determine the length

	  When Asterisk's taskprocessors get overloaded we need to reduce the work

	  enough to handle the retransmitted SIP request.
	  This change adds the following code after ast_taskprocessor_alert_get()
	  has returned TRUE:
	  1- identifies transport type. If non-udp then send a 503 response
	  2- if transport type is udp/udp6 then ignore, as before.

	* stasis: Clarify lifetime of topics.

	  As mentioned in the comment I've added in the code there is no
	  ability to unsubscribe all subscribers from a topic and explicitly
	  destroy it. This is not currently a problem as we have two types of
	  topics:

	  Long lived topics which exist for the lifetime of the system.
	  Ephemeral topics which feed a long lived topic.

	  In the case of the ephemeral topics there is no subscriber which does
	  not have its lifetime managed by the same entity that has created
	  the topic. This ensures that when the topic is being unreferenced the
	  subscribers are also unsubscribed and destroyed, allowing the topic
	  to ultimately be destroyed as well.

	* res_pjsip: set callerid_tag to empty string

	  This patch sets the callerid_tag to empty string by default.

	  If the callerid_tag is set to NULL then the tag does not
	  become part of a connected line update.
	  For example:
	  Alice's tag is "Alice".
	  Bob's tag is empty.
	  Charlie's tag is "Charlie".
	  Alice calls Bob and then does attended transfer to Charlie.
	  When Alice hangs up the CONNECTEDLINE(tag) is "Alice"
	  on the interception routine on the Charlie's channel, but should be empty.

	  Ths patch also fix memory leaks if there are more then one options
	  "callerid", "callerid_tag", "voicemail_extension" and "contact_user"
	  in the pjsip.conf endpoint definition.

	* app_confbridge:  Use bridge join hook to send join and leave events

	  The first attempt at publishing confbridge events to participants
	  involved publishing them at the same time stasis events were
	  created.  This caused issues with bridge and channel locks.  The
	  second attempt involved publishing them when the stasis events
	  were received by the code that published the confbridge AMI events.
	  This caused timing issues because, depending on resources available,
	  the event could be received before channels actually joined the
	  bridge and would therefore fail to send messages to the participant.

	  This attempt reverts to the original mechanism with one exception.
	  The join and leave events are published via bridge join and leave
	  hooks.  This guarantees the states of the channels and bridge and
	  provides deterministic timing for event publishing.

	* app_queue: Fix Attended transfer hangup with removing pending member.

	  This issue related to setting of holdtime, announcements, member delays.
	  It works well if we set the member delays to "0" and no announcements
	  and no holdtime.This issue will happen if we set member delays to "1",
	  "2"... or announcements or holdtime and hangs up the call during
	  processing it.

	  And here is the reason:
	  (At the step of answering a phone.)
	  It takes care any holdtime, announcements, member delays,
	  or other options after a call has been answered if it exists.

	  Normally, After the call has been aswered,
	  and we wait for the processing one of the cases of the member delays
	  or hold time or announcements finished, "if (ast_check_hangup(peer))"
	  will be not executed, then queue will be updated at update_queue().
	  Here, pending member will be removed.

	  However, after the call has been aswered,
	  if we hangs up the call during one of the cases of the member delays
	  or hold time or announcements, "if (ast_check_hangup(peer))"
	  will be executed.
	  outgoing = NULL and at hangupcalls, pending members will not be removed.

	  * This fixed patch will remove the pending member from container
	  before hanging up the call with outgoing is NULL.

	* res_stasis: Fix stale data in ARI bridges

	  Fixed an issue that resulted in "Allocation failed" each time an ARI
	  request was made to start playing MOH on a bridge.

	  In bridge_moh_create() we were attaching the after bridge callbacks to
	  chan which is the ;1 channel of the unreal channel pair.  We should have
	  attached them to the ;2 channel which is pushed into the bridge by
	  ast_unreal_channel_push_to_bridge().  The callbacks are called when the
	  specific channel leaves the bridging system.  Since the ;1 channel is
	  never put into a bridge the callbacks never get called.  The callbacks
	  then never remove the moh_wrapper from the app_bridges_moh container.  As
	  a result we cannot find the channel associated with the wrapper to start
	  MOH because it has hungup.  This is the reason causing the reported issue.

	  * Rather than using after bridge callbacks to cleanup, we now have
	  moh_channel_thread() doing the cleanup when the channel hangs up.

	  * Fixed moh_channel_thread() accumulating control frames on the stasis
	  bridge MOH channel until MOH is stopped.  Control frames are no longer
	  accumulated while MOH is playing.

	  * Fixed channel ref counting issue.  stasis_app_bridge_moh_channel() may
	  or may not return a channel ref.  As a result ast_ari_bridges_start_moh()
	  wouldn't know it may have a channel ref to release.
	  stasis_app_bridge_moh_channel() will now return a ref with the channel it
	  returns.

	  * Eliminated RAII_VAR in bridge_moh_create().

	  between receiving packets. When strictrtp is enabled, this created
	  issues where a flood of packets could come in and be seen as an attack.
	  Another option - seqno - has been added to the strictrtp option that
	  ignores the time interval and goes strictly by sequence number for
	  validity.

	* res_odbc: fix missing SQL error diagnostic

	  On SQL error there is not diagnostic information about this error.
	  There is only
	  WARNING res_odbc.c: SQL Execute error -1!

	  The function ast_odbc_print_errors calls a SQLGetDiagField to get the number
	  of available diagnostic records, but the SQLGetDiagField returns 0.
	  However SQLGetDiagRec could return one diagnostic records in this case.

	  Looking at many example of getting diagnostics error information
	  I found out that the best way it's to use only SQLGetDiagRec
	  while it returns SQL_SUCCESS.

	  Also this patch adds calls of ast_odbc_print_errors on SQL_ERROR
	  to res_config_odbc.

	* rtp_engine: rtcp_report_to_json can overflow the ssrc integer value

	  When writing an RTCP report to json the code attempts to pack the "ssrc" and
	  "source_ssrc" unsigned integer values as a signed int value type. This of course
	  means if the ssrc's unsigned value is greater than that which can fit into a
	  signed integer value it gets converted to a negative number. Subsequently, the
	  negative value goes out in the json report.

	  This patch now packs the value as a json_int_t, which is the widest integer type
	  available on a given system. This should make it so the value no longer
	  overflows.

	  Note, this was caught by two failing tests hep/rtcp-receiver/ and
	  hep/rtcp-sender.

	* stasis: No need to keep a stasis type ref in a stasis msg or cache object.

	  Stasis message types are global ao2 objects and we make stasis messages
	  and cache entries hold references to them.  Since there are currently
	  situations where cache objects are never deleted, the reference count on
	  the types can exceed 100000 and generate a FRACK assertion message.  The
	  stasis message cache could conceivably also have that many messages
	  legitimately on large systems.

	  The only down side to not holding the message type ref in the stasis
	  message is it only makes a crash either at shutdown or when manually
	  unloading a busy module slightly more likely.  However, this is more
	  exposing a pre-existing stasis shutdown ordering issue than a problem with
	  not holding a message type ref in stasis messages.

	  * Made stasis messages and cache entries no longer hold a ref to the
	  message type.

	* app_voicemail: Remove need to subscribe to stasis

	  app_voicemail was using the stasis cache to build and maintain a
	  list of mailboxes that had subscribers.  It then used this list
	  to determine if a mailbox should be polled for new messages if
	  polling was enabled.  For this to work, stasis had to cache every
	  subscription and unsubscription to the mailbox which caused a lot of
	  overhead, both cpu and memory related.

	  Since polling is only required when changes are being made to
	  mailboxes outside of app_voicemail and since the number of mailboxes
	  that don't have any subscribers is likely to be very low, all
	  mailboxes are now polled instead of just the ones with subscribers.

	  This paves the way for disabling the caching of stasis subscription
	  change messages.

	  Also fixed cleanup in some of the unit tests that not only left
	  test users in the users list but also caused segfaults if the tests
	  were run more than once.

	* res_pjproject: Add utility functions to convert between socket structures

	  Currently, to convert from a pj_sockaddr to an ast_sockaddr, the address
	  needs to be rendered to a string and then parsed into the correct
	  structure. This also involves a call to getaddrinfo(3). The same is true
	  for the inverse operation.

	  Instead, because we know the internal structure of both ast_sockaddr and
	  pj_sockaddr, we can translate directly between the two without the
	  need for an intermediate string.

	* stasis_cache: Prune stasis_subscription_change messages

	  The stasis cache provides a way to reconstruct the current state
	  of topic subscribers.  Unfortunately, since every subscribe and
	  unsubscribe is cached, the cache continues to grow unabated while
	  asterisk is running.  This patch removes subscribe messages from
	  the cache when the corresponding unsubscribe is received.

	  This patch also registers the cache containers with ao2 so that if
	  AO2_DEBUG is turned on, you can list the container and get its
	  stats from the CLI.

	* res_fax: Handle fax gateway being started more than once.

	  The T.38 fax gateway state machine can cause the fax gateway
	  to be started more than once on a channel depending on the
	  responses of the remote endpoint. This would previously leak
	  the channel name, channel unique id, and underlying fax engine
	  state. This change instead makes it so that if the fax gateway
	  session is already present and not reserved the fax gateway
	  is not started again.

	* res_pjsip_transport_websocket: Properly set src_name for IPv6

	  SIP responses over WebSockets when the client is using IPv6 have invalid
	  Via headers according to RFC 3261. The 'received' header parameter
	  should not be wrapped in brackets if it is an IPv6 address.

	  When src_name is populated by the built-in PJSIP transports, the code
	  uses pj_sockaddr_print() with 'flags' set to 0, meaning that the
	  brackets are not rendered around IPv6 addresses.

	  This may be related to ASTERISK~27101.

	* Create --disable-binary-modules option.

	  This new option can be passed for ./configure or
	  ./tests/CI/buildAsterisk.sh to prevent download/install of binary
	  modules.

	  Normally enabling the categories MENUSELECT_CODECS or MENUSELECT_RES
	  will result in binary modules being enabled even if the build target is
	  incompatible with those modules.  This includes CI scripts which enable
	  categories before disabling specific modules.

	  If more binary modules are offered in the future this will help avoid
	  accidentally downloading them if unwanted or incompatible.  Adding a
	  binary module will only require creating a new menuselect entry similar
	  to the existing ones, it will not be necessary to modify the CI scripts.

	* chan_sip: improved ip:port finding of peers for non-UDP transports.

	  Also remove function peer_ipcmp_cb since it's not used (according to
	  rmudgett).

	  Prior to b2c4e8660a9c89d07041271371151779b7ec75f6 (ASTERISK_27457)
	  insecure=port was the defacto standard.  That commit also prevented
	  insecure=port from being applied for sip/tcp or sip/tls.

	  Into consideration there are three sets of behaviour:

	  1.  "previous" - before the above commit.
	  2.  "current" - post above commit, pre this one.
	  3.  "new" - post this commit.

	  The problem that the above commit tried to address was guests over TCP.
	  It succeeded in doing that but broke transport!=udp with host!=dynamic.

	  This commit attempts to restore sane behaviour with respect to
	  transport!=udp for host!=dynamic whilst still retaining the guest users
	  over tcp.

	  It should be noted that when looking for a peer, two passes are made, the
	  first pass doesn't have SIP_INSECURE_PORT set for the searched-for peer,
	  thus looking for full matches (IP + Port), the second pass sets
	  SIP_INSECURE_PORT, thus expecting matches on IP only where the matched
	  peer allows for that (in the author's opinion:  UDP with insecure=port,
	  or any TCP based, non-dynamic host).

	  In previous behaviour there was special handling for transport=tcp|tls
	  whereby a peer would match during the first pass if the utilized
	  transport was TCP|TLS (and the peer allowed that specific transport).

	  This behaviour was wrong, or dubious at best.  Consider two dynamic tcp
	  peers, both registering from the same IP (NAT), in this case either peer
	  could match for connections from an IP.  It's also this behaviour that
	  prevented SIP guests over tcp.

	  The above referenced commit removed this behaviour, but kept applying
	  the SIP_INSECURE_PORT only to WS|WSS|UDP.  Since WS and WSS is also TCP
	  based, the logic here should fall into the TCP category.

	  This patch updates things such that the previously non-explicit (TCP
	  behaviour) transport test gets performed explicitly (ie, matched peer
	  must allow for the used transport), as well as the indeterministic
	  source-port nature of the TCP protocol is taken into account.  The new
	  match algorithm now looks like:

	  1.  As per previous behaviour, IP address is matched first.

	  2.  Explicit filter with respect to transport protocol, previous
	      behaviour was semi-implied in the test for TCP pure IP match - this now
	      made explicit.

	  3.  During first pass (without SIP_INSECURE_PORT), always match on port.

	  4.  If doing UDP, match if matched against peer also has
	      SIP_INSECURE_PORT, else don't match.

	  5.  Match if not a dynamic host (for non-UDP protocols)

	  6.  Don't match if this is WS|WSS, or we can't trust the Contact address
	      (presumably due to NAT)

	  7.  Match (we have a valid Contact thus if the IP matches we have no
	      choice, this will likely only apply to non-NAT).

	  To logic-test this we need a few different scenarios.  Towards this end,
	  I work with a set number of peers defined in sip.conf:

	  [peer1]
	  host=1.1.1.1
	  transport=tcp

	  [peer2]
	  host=1.1.1.1
	  transport=udp

	  [peer3]
	  host=1.1.1.1
	  port=5061
	  insecure=port
	  transport=udp

	  [peer4]
	  host=1.1.1.2
	  transport=udp,tcp

	  [peer5]
	  host=dynamic
	  transport=udp,tcp

	  Test cases for UDP:

	  1 - incoming UDP request from 1.1.1.1:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer1 or peer2 if from port 5060 (indeterminate, depends on peer
	          ordering)
	        * peer3 if from port 5061
	        * peer5 if registered from 1.1.1.1 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer3
	    - current: as per previous.
	    - new:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer2 if from port 5060
	        * peer3 if from port 5061
	        * peer5 if registered from 1.1.1.1 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer3

	  2 - incoming UDP request from 1.1.1.2:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from 1.1.1.2 and port matches
	        * peer4 if source port is 5060
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest)
	    - current: as previous.
	    - new as previous (with the variation that if peer5 didn't have udp as
	            allowed transport it would not match peer5 whereas previous
	            and current code could).

	  3 - incoming UDP request from anywhere else:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from that address and source port matches.
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer5 if insecure=port is additionally set.
	        * no match (guest)
	    - current - as per previous
	    - new - as per previous

	  Test cases for TCP based transports:

	  4 - incoming TCP request from 1.1.1.1
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1 (indeterministic, depends on ordering of peers in memory):
	        * peer1; or
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered from 1.1.1.1 (irrespective of source port); or
	        * peer2 if the source port happens to be 5060; or
	        * peer3 if the source port happens to be 5061.
	      - pass 2: cannot happen since pass 1 will always find a peer.
	    - current:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer1 or peer2 if from source port 5060
	        * peer3 if from source port 5060
	        * peer5 if registered as 1.1.1.1 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest)
	    - new:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer 1 if from port 5060
	        * peer 5 if registered and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer 1

	  5 - incoming TCP request from 1.1.1.2
	    - previous (indeterminate, depends on ordering):
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer4; or
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered from 1.1.1.2
	      - pass 2: cannot happen since pass 1 will always find a peer.
	    - current:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer4 if source port is 5060
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered as 1.1.1.2 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest).
	    - new:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer4 if source port is 5060
	        * peer5 if peer5 registered as 1.1.1.2 and source port matches
	      - pass 2:
	        * peer4

	  6 - incoming TCP request from anywhere else:
	    - previous:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from that address
	      - pass 2: cannot happen since pass 1 will always find a peer.
	    - current:
	      - pass 1:
	        * peer5 if registered from that address and port matches.
	      - pass 2:
	        * no match (guest)
	    - new: as per current.

	  It should be noted the test cases don't make explicit mention of TLS, WS
	  or WSS.  WS and WSS previously followed UDP semantics, they will now
	  enforce source port matching.  TLS follow TCP semantics.

	  The previous commit specifically tried to address test-case 6, but broke
	  test-cases 4 and 5 in the process.

	* Build System: Improve ccache matching for different menuselect options.

	  Changing any Menuselect option in the `Compiler Flags` section causes a
	  full rebuild of the Asterisk source tree.  Every enabled option causes
	  a #define to be added to buildopts.h, thus breaking ccache caching for
	  every source file that includes "asterisk.h".  In most cases each option
	  only applies to one or two files.  Now we only define those options for
	  the specific sources which use them, this causes much better cache
	  matching when working with multiple builds.  For example testing code
	  with an without MALLOC_DEBUG will now use just over half the ccache
	  size, only main/astmm.o will have two builds cached instead of every
	  file.

	  Reorder main/Makefile so _ASTCFLAGS set on specific object files are all
	  together, sorted by filename.  Stop adding -DMALLOC_DEBUG to CFLAGS of
	  bundled pjproject, this define is no longer used by any header so only
	  serves to break cache.

	  The only code change is a slight adjustment to how main/astmm.c is
	  initialized.  Initialization functions always exist so main/asterisk.c
	  can call them unconditionally.  Additionally rename the astmm
	  initialization functions so they are not exported.

	* CI: Add support for coverage processing.

	  Enable coverage with `./tests/CI/buildAsterisk.sh --coverage`.  This
	  will cause Asterisk to be compiled with coverage support.  It also
	  initializes 'before' coverage data for all sources.  Accept
	  --tested-only to disable modules which are not run by any test.
	  Enabling coverage also sets tested-only true by default.  To build
	  everything with coverage enabled use `--coverage --tested-only=0`.

	  ./tests/CI/processCoverage.sh is used to process the coverage and
	  generate HTML reports.

	  Fix utils/check_expr2 which failed to compiled with coverage enabled.

	  Add status output 5 times per stage of astobj2_test_perf to ensure
	  remote CLI does not timeout when compiled with coverage.  Remote CLI
	  disconnects if no output is received for 60 seconds.  When coverage is
	  enabled it takes about 70 seconds for my laptop to run the stages of
	  this test, so with the change a message is printed every 14 seconds.

	* res_pjsip/rtp: No joint capabilities between streams.

	  When a conference contained a mixture of audio/video and audio-only
	  users, a NOTICE message would pop up stating there are no joint
	  capabilities between streams. This happens because streams can never be
	  removed, but they can be in a REMOVED state. If we have the scenario
	  where user A joins with audio/video, user B joins with audio-only, and
	  user C joins with audio/video, then user A leaves, the message would
	  be triggered. That removed stream is still in the SDP, but Asterisk
	  would pass it through, causing it to be seen as a ulaw stream. A check
	  has been added for removed streams, setting their status to REMOVED when
	  handling negotiated SDPs.

	  Also addressed an issue where user A joins, then user B joins but does
	  not receive video until much later. Full frames were not being sent,
	  causing some PLI from the browser. Because the video was flowing in one
	  direction, the browser sets the SSRC to 1, but Asterisk was dropping the
	  PLI because of that. Added a check to see if the SSRC is 1 or not, which
	  sends full frames and allows video to flow between user A and user B.
	  This should only happen when dealing with PSFB or FUR, and in the case
	  of PSFB, only for PLI.

	* res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Added regex support to match_header

	  This patch adds regular expression support to make the identify section's
	  match_header option more useful when attempting to match complex headers
	  like the 'To' or 'From' headers.  The 'From' header has variable
	  components such as the tag parameter that you cannot predict.  To specify
	  a regular expression put slashes around the regular expression in place of
	  the header value.

	  [identify-alice]
	  type=identify
	  endpoint=alice
	  match_header=From: /<sip:alice@127\\.0\\.0\\.1>/

	  * Added regex support to match_header so you could match a 'To' header
	  among other complex headers.

	  Fixed reported crashes when trying to match special headers like 'Contact'.
	  The identify section's match_header method used code that assumed you were
	  matching a generic header.  Any other type of header could cause a crash
	  if the header structure variant did not match the generic header enough.

	  * Made use code that will work for any header type instead of code
	  specific to generic headers.

	  Other fixes while in the area:

	  * Made check all headers of the requested name.
	  * Added some more sanity checks to the configured identify matching
	  options when applying the configuration.

	* json.c: improve ast_json_to_ast_variables performance

	  When converting from a json object to an ast variables list the conversion
	  algorithm was doing a complete traversal of the entire variables list for
	  every item appended from the json structure.

	  This patch makes it so the list is no longer traversed for each new ast
	  variable being appended.

	* devicestate: Don't create topic when change isn't cached.

	  When publishing a device state the change can be marked as being
	  cachable or not. If it is not cached the change is just published
	  to all interested and not stored away for later query. This was not
	  fully taken into account when publishing in stasis. The act of
	  publishing would create a topic for the device even if it may be
	  ephemeral.

	  This change makes it so messages which are not cached won't create
	  a topic for the device. If a topic does already exist it will be
	  published to but otherwise the change will only be published to
	  the device state all topic.

	* loader: Process dependencies for built-in modules.

	  With the new module loader it was missed that built-in modules never

	  manager to be initialized before acl (named_acl).  If manager.conf
	  used any named ACL's they would not be found and result in no ACL being
	  applied to the AMI user.

	  In addition to the manager ACL fix this adds "extconfig" to all builtin
	  modules which support realtime configuration.  This only matters if one
	  of the builtin modules is configured with 'preload', depending on
	  "extconfig" will cause config.c to automatically be initialize during
	  the preload stage.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Add support for sending NACK requests.

	  Support has been added for receiving a NACK request and handling it.
	  Now, Asterisk can detect when a NACK request should be sent and knows
	  how to construct one based on the packets we've received from the remote
	  end. A buffer has been added that will store out of order packets until
	  we receive the packet we are expecting. Then, these packets are handled
	  like normal and frames are queued to the core like normal. Asterisk
	  knows which packets to request in the NACK request using a vector
	  which stores the sequence numbers of the packets we are currently missing.

	  If a missing packet is received, cycle through the buffer until we reach
	  another packet we have not received yet. If the buffer reaches a certain
	  size, send a NACK request. If the buffer reaches its max size, queue all
	  frames to the core and wipe the buffer and vector.

	  According to RFC3711, the NACK request must be sent out in a compound
	  packet. All compound packets must start with a sender or receiver
	  report, so some work was done to refactor the current sender / receiver
	  code to allow it to be used without having to also include sdes
	  information and automatically send the report.

	  Also added additional functionality to ast_data_buffer, along with some
	  testing.

	* res_sorcery_config: Allow configuration section to be used based on name.

	  A problem I've seen countless times is a global or system section
	  for PJSIP not getting applied. This is inevitably the result of
	  the "type=" line missing. This change alleviates that problem.

	  The ability to specify an explicit section name has been
	  added to res_sorcery_config. If the configured section
	  name matches this and there are no unknown things configured
	  the section is taken as being for the given type.

	  Both the PJSIP "global" and "system" types now support this
	  so you can just name your section "global" or "system" and it
	  will be matched and used, even without a "type=" line.

	    effective if the modules failed to load.  These options will now abort
	    Asterisk startup if required modules fail to reach the 'Running'

	  Using the keep_alive_interval option can result in a deadlock between the

	* app_confbridge: Bridge and announcers not removed if conference ends quickly

	  If a conference is ended very quickly after it was created (i.e., the
	  first user immediately hangs up) then the conference bridge and announcer
	  channels are not removed.

	  When a conference is created, the push_announcer() function is added to
	  the playback queue task processor and the conference object reference is
	  bumped.  If a conference is ended while the push_announcer() function is
	  still going then the ao2_cleanup(conference) at the end of
	  push_announcer() will call the destructor function -
	  destroy_conference_bridge().

	  The destroy_conference_bridge() function will then add the
	  hangup_playback() task to the playback queue and will wait for it to end.
	  Since it is already a current task of the playback queue it will wait
	  forever.

	  This patch makes the conference thread call push_announcer() directly.
	  This way the conference object reference bump is not needed.  Since the
	  playback queue task processor is only used by the conference thread
	  itself, there is no danger of trying to play announcements before the
	  announcer is pushed to the bridge.

	* res_pjsip_session:  Add ability to accept multiple sdp answers

	  pjproject by default currently will follow media forked during an INVITE
	  on outbound calls if the To tag is different on a subsequent response as
	  that on an earlier response.  We handle this correctly.  There have
	  been reported cases where the To tag is the same but we still need to
	  follow the media.  The pjproject patch in this commit adds the
	  capability to sip_inv and also adds the capability to control it at
	  runtime.  The original "different tag" behavior was always controllable
	  at runtime but we never did anything with it and left it to default to
	  TRUE.

	  So, along with the pjproject patch, this commit adds options to both the
	  system and endpoint objects to control the two behaviors, and a small
	  logic change to session_inv_on_media_update in res_pjsip_session to
	  control the behavior at the endpoint level.

	  The default behavior for "different tags" remains the same at TRUE and
	  the default for "same tag" is FALSE.

	* app_confbridge:  Enable sending events to participants

	  ConfBridge can now send events to participants via in-dialog MESSAGEs.
	  All current Confbridge events are supported, such as ConfbridgeJoin,
	  ConfbridgeLeave, etc.  In addition to those events, a new event
	  ConfbridgeWelcome has been added that will send a list of all
	  current participants to a new participant.

	  For all but the ConfbridgeWelcome event, the JSON message contains
	  information about the bridge, such as its id and name, and information
	  about the channel that triggered the event such as channel name,
	  callerid info, mute status, and the MSID labels for their audio and
	  video tracks. You can use the labels to correlate callerid and mute
	  status to specific video elements in a webrtc client.

	  To control this behavior, the following options have been added to
	  confbridge.conf:

	  bridge_profile/enable_events:  This must be enabled on any bridge where
	  events are desired.

	  user_profile/send_events:  This must be set for a user profile to send
	  events.  Different user profiles connected to the same bridge can have
	  different settings.  This allows admins to get events but not normal
	  users for instance.

	  user_profile/echo_events:  In some cases, you might not want the user
	  triggering the event to get the event sent back to them.  To prevent it,
	  set this to false.

	  A change was also made to res_pjsip_sdp_rtp to save the generated msid
	  to the stream so it can be re-used.  This allows participant A's video
	  stream to appear as the same label to all other participants.

	* rtp: Add support for RTP extension negotiation and abs-send-time.

	  When RTP was originally created it had the ability to place a single
	  extension in an RTP packet. In practice people wanted to potentially
	  put multiple extensions in one and so RFC 5285 (obsoleted by RFC
	  8285) came into existence. This allows RTP extensions to be negotiated
	  with a unique identifier to be used in the RTP packet, allowing
	  multiple extensions to be present in the packet.

	  This change extends the RTP engine API to add support for this. A
	  user of it can enable extensions and the API provides the ability to
	  retrieve the information (to construct SDP for example) and to provide
	  negotiated information (from SDP). The end result is that the RTP
	  engine can then query to see if the extension has been negotiated and
	  what unique identifier is to be used. It is then up to the RTP engine
	  implementation to construct the packet appropriately.

	  The first extension to use this support is abs-send-time which is
	  defined in the REMB draft[1] and is a second timestamp placed in an
	  RTP packet which is for when the packet has left the sending system.
	  It is used to more accurately determine the available bandwidth.

	  Add support to handle caller-ID names ("cnam") in addition to caller-ID

	  used the local name for the cell phone (e.g. "my-iphone") in its place.

	  Note: as of this writing, at least some Android phones don't pass cnam to
	  us. This can be seen by issuing "core set debug 2" in the CLI and watching
	  the "CLIP" record when a call comes in.  If cnam isn't in the CLIP record,
	  there's nothing we can do to provide one.  We'll provide a null cnam field,
	  so later Asterisk processes know to try other sources (e.g. cidname database,
	  OpenCNAM, etc.).

	* stream: Make the topology a reference counted object.

	  The stream topology has no lock of its own resulting in
	  another lock protecting it in some way (for example the
	  channel lock). If multiple channels are being juggled at
	  the same time this can be problematic. This change makes
	  the topology a reference counted object instead which
	  guarantees it will remain valid even without the channel
	  lock being held.

	  Analog phones dial overlap dialing and it is chan_dahdi's job to read the
	  numbers.  It has three timeout constants that this commit converts to
	  channel-level configuration options:

	  * firstdigit_timeout: Default time (ms) to detect first digit

	  * interdigit_timeout: Default time (ms) to detect following digits

	  * matchdigit_timeout: Default time (ms) to wait in case of ambiguous
	  match.  This happens when the dialed digits match a number in the current
	  context but are also the prefix of another number.

	* Add the ability to read the media file type from HTTP header for playback

	  How it works today:
	  media_cache tries to parse out the extension of the media file to be played
	  from the URI provided to Asterisk while caching the file.

	  What's expected:
	  Better will be to have Asterisk get extension from other ways too. One of the
	  common ways is to get the type of content from the CONTENT-TYPE header in the
	  HTTP response for fetching the media file using the URI provided.

	  Steps to Reproduce:
	  Provide a URL of the form: http://host/media/1234 to Asterisk for media
	  playback. It fails to play and logs show the following error line:

	  [Sep 15 15:48:05] WARNING [29148] [C-00000092] file.c:
	  File http://host/media/1234 does not exist in any format

	  Scenario this issue is blocking:
	  In the case where the media files are stored in some cloud object store,
	  following can block the media being played via Asterisk:

	  Cloud storage generally needs authenticated access to the storage. The way
	  to do that is by using signed URIs. With the signed URIs there's no way to
	  preserve the name of the file.
	  In most cases Cloud storage returns a key to access the object and preserving
	  file name is also not a thing there

	* pjsip: Rewrite OPTIONS support with new eyes.

	  The OPTIONS support in PJSIP has organically grown, like many things in
	  Asterisk.  It has been tweaked, changed, and adapted based on situations
	  run into.  Unfortunately this has taken its toll.  Configuration file
	  based objects have poor performance and even dynamic ones aren't that
	  great.

	  This change scraps the existing code and starts fresh with new eyes.  It
	  leverages all of the APIs made available such as sorcery observers and
	  serializers to provide a better implementation.

	  1.  The state of contacts, AORs, and endpoints relevant to the qualify
	  process is maintained.  This state can be updated by external forces (such
	  as a device registering/unregistering) and also the reload process.  This
	  state also includes the association between endpoints and AORs.

	  2.  AORs are scheduled and not contacts.  This reduces the amount of work
	  spent juggling scheduled items.

	  3.  Manipulation of which AORs are being qualified and the endpoint states
	  all occur within a serializer to reduce the conflict that can occur with
	  multiple threads attempting to modify things.

	  4.  Operations regarding an AOR use a serializer specific to that AOR.

	  5.  AORs and endpoint state act as state compositors.  They take input
	  from lower level objects (contacts feed AORs, AORs feed endpoint state)
	  and determine if a sufficient enough change has occurred to be fed further
	  up the chain.

	  6.  Realtime is supported by using observers to know when a contact has
	  been registered.  If state does not exist for the associated AOR then it
	  is retrieved and becomes active as appropriate.

	  The end result of all of this is best shown with a configuration file of
	  3000 endpoints each with an AOR that has a static contact.  In the old
	  code it would take over a minute to load and use all 8 of my cores.  This
	  new code takes 2-3 seconds and barely touches the CPU even while dealing
	  with all of the OPTIONS requests.

	  If during translation a codec could not handle a given frame the translation

	  there was no frame to apply generic plc to, thus rendering it useless.

	  This patch makes it so the translation core produces an interpolated slin frame
	  in the cases where an attempt was made to translate to slin, but failed. This
	  interpolated frame is then passed along and can be used by the generic plc
	  algorithms to fill in the frame.

	* bridge_softmix:  Forward TEXT frames

	  Core bridging and, more specifically, bridge_softmix have been
	  enhanced to relay received frames of type TEXT or TEXT_DATA to all
	  participants in a softmix bridge.  res_pjsip_messaging and
	  chan_pjsip have been enhanced to take advantage of this so when
	  res_pjsip_messaging receives an in-dialog MESSAGE message from a
	  user in a conference call, it's relayed to all other participants
	  in the call.

	  res_pjsip_messaging already queues TEXT frames to the channel when
	  it receives an in-dialog MESSAGE from an endpoint and chan_pjsip
	  will send an MESSAGE when it gets a TEXT frame.  On a normal
	  point-to-point call, the frames are forwarded between the two
	  correctly.  bridge_softmix was not though so messages weren't
	  getting forwarded to conference bridge participants.  Even if they
	  were, the bridging code had no way to tell the participants who
	  sent the message so it would look like it came from the bridge
	  itself.

	  * The TEXT frame type doesn't allow storage of any meta data, such
	  as sender, on the frame so a new TEXT_DATA frame type was added that
	  uses the new ast_msg_data structure as its payload.  A channel
	  driver can queue a frame of that type when it receives a message
	  from outside.  A channel driver can use it for sending messages
	  by implementing the new send_text_data channel tech callback and
	  setting the new AST_CHAN_TP_SEND_TEXT_DATA flag in its tech
	  properties.  If set, the bridging/channel core will use it instead
	  of the original send_text callback and it will get the ast_msg_data
	  structure. Channel drivers aren't required to implement this.  Even
	  if a TEXT_DATA enabled driver uses it for incoming messages, an
	  outgoing channel driver that doesn't will still have it's send_text
	  callback called with only the message text just as before.

	  * res_pjsip_messaging now creates a TEXT_DATA frame for incoming
	  in-dialog messages and sets the "from" to the display name in the
	  "From" header, or if that's empty, the caller id name from the
	  channel.  This allows the chat client user to set a friendly name
	  for the chat.

	  * bridge_softmix now forwards TEXT and TEXT_DATA frames to all
	  participants (except the sender).

	  * A new function "ast_sendtext_data" was added to channel which
	  takes an ast_msg_data structure and calls a channel's
	  send_text_data callback, or if that's not defined, the original
	  send_text callback.

	  * bridge_channel now calls ast_sendtext_data for TEXT_DATA frame
	  types and ast_sendtext for TEXT frame types.

	  * chan_pjsip now uses the "from" name in the ast_msg_data structure
	  (if it exists) to set the "From" header display name on outgoing text
	  messages.

	* res_musiconhold: Don't restart MOH from beginning after announcement.

	  This reverts a problem introduced by the fix for ASTERISK_24329.
	  Now, when an announcement is played while waiting in a queue, music on
	  hold will not restart from the beginning of the sound file and will
	  instead pick up where it left off. However, the incorrect behavior in
	  ASTERISK_24329 is now present again; if an announcement X seconds
	  long is played when music on hold starts, music on hold will start X
	  seconds into the file.

	* res_pjsip.c: Split ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() to fit expectations.

	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() did not necessarily execute the passed in
	  task under the specified serializer.  If the current thread is any
	  registered pjsip thread then it would execute the task immediately instead
	  of under the specified serializer.  Reentrancy issues could result if the
	  task does not execute with the right serializer.

	  The original reason ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() checked to see if the
	  current thread was a registered pjsip thread was because of a deadlock
	  with masquerades and the channel technology's fixup callback
	  (ASTERISK_22936).  A subsequent masquerade deadlock fix (ASTERISK_24356)
	  involving call pickups avoided the original deadlock situation entirely.
	  The PJSIP channel technology's fixup callback no longer needed to call
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous().

	  However, there are a few places where this unexpected behavior is still
	  required to avoid deadlocks.  The pjsip monitor thread executes callbacks
	  that do calls to ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() that would deadlock if
	  the task were actually pushed to the specified serializer.  I ran into one
	  dealing with the pubsub subscriptions where an ao2 destructor called
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous().

	  * Split ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() into
	  ast_sip_push_task_wait_servant() and ast_sip_push_task_wait_serializer().
	  ast_sip_push_task_wait_servant() has the old behavior of
	  ast_sip_push_task_synchronous().  ast_sip_push_task_wait_serializer() has
	  the new behavior where the task is always executed by the specified
	  serializer or a picked serializer if one is not passed in.  Both functions
	  behave the same if the current thread is not a SIP servant.

	  * Redirected ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() to
	  ast_sip_push_task_wait_servant() to preserve API for released branches.

	* chan_sip.c: Fix INVITE with replaces channel ref leak.

	  Given the below call scenario:
	  A -> Ast1 -> B
	  C <- Ast2 <- B

	  1) A calls B through Ast1
	  2) B calls C through Ast2
	  3) B transfers A to C

	  When party B transfers A to C, B sends a REFER to Ast1 causing Ast1 to
	  send an INVITE with replaces to Ast2.  Ast2 then leaks a channel ref of
	  the channel between Ast1 and Ast2.

	  Channel ref leaks are easily seen in the CLI "core show channels" output.
	  The leaked channels appear in the output but you can do nothing with them
	  and they never go away unless you restart Asterisk.

	  * Properly account for the channel refs when imparting a channel into a
	  bridge when handling an INVITE with replaces in handle_invite_replaces().
	  The ast_bridge_impart() function steals a channel ref but the code didn't
	  account for how many refs were held by the code at the time and which ref
	  was stolen.

	  A deadlock can happen when the PJSIP monitor thread is shutting down a

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Add support for raising additional RTCP messages.

	  This change extends the existing AST_FRAME_RTCP frame type to be
	  able to contain additional RTCP message types, such as feedback
	  messages. The payload type is contained in the subclass which allows
	  knowing what is in the frame itself.

	  The RTCP feedback message type is now handled and REMB[1] messages
	  are raised with their containing information.

	  This also fixes a bug where all feedback messages were triggering
	  video updates instead of just FIR and FUR.

	  Finally RTCP frames are now passed up through the Asterisk core to
	  what is handling the channel, mapped appropriately in the case of
	  bridging, and written to an outgoing stream. Since RTCP frames are
	  on a per-stream basis this is only done on multistream capable
	  channels.

	* BuildSystem: For consistency, avoid extra libs to be empty.

	  AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK has several optional parameters. When an optional parameter
	  is left empty, [] is used to indicate this. However, this is done in the script
	  ./configure only then, when a further parameter is not empty. For example, when
	  no extra libraries are needed to test the checked library, parameter 5 is not
	  mentioned. Except parameter 6 and higher are used, then parameter 5 must be
	  empty.

	  However, this general rule was broken
	  * four times for parameter 5 (extra libs) and
	  * three times for parameter 4 (header)
	  as found via the Regular Expression \[\]\). In case of parameter 5, all cases
	  were changed, because that happened for no reason. In case of parameter 4, an
	  [] improves readability actually. Therefore for parameter 4, the only case which
	  did not do it was changed. All this aims to create more consistency: Only do
	  something different if there is a reason to do so.

	  Asterisk uses various symbols of the shared library libogg within the module
	  format_ogg_vorbis. However, the source code of that module did not include the
	  header file of libogg explicitly but implicitly. Because that header was not
	  included before Asterisk 14, the script ./configure was told not to check for
	  it.

	  Anyway, even Asterisk 13 LTS uses symbols of libogg. Therefore, that header
	  should be included explicitly. Therefore, ./configure should check for that
	  header.

	  Remove menuselect conflicts between MALLOC_DEBUG and DEBUG_CHAOS as they

	  * Removal of these inline functions decreases size of Asterisk and
	    module binaries by 1% or more.
	  * Puts memory management functions together with and without
	    MALLOC_DEBUG enabled, simplifying management of the code.
	  * Enables DEBUG_CHAOS for ASTMM_REDIRECT and bundled pjproject.

	  Nine years ago with Mantis 13639 (now ASTERISK-12841) an extra case for OpenBSD
	  was introduced: Vorbis required Ogg to be specified manually, because the shared
	  library libvorbis.so did not specify its required dependency on -logg itself.

	  Today with OpenBSD 6.2, all libvorbis*.so declare their dependencies correctly.
	  Therefore, an extra case is not required anymore.

	* BuildSystem: Enable Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in NetBSD.

	  In the script ./configure, AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK checks for external libraries. Some
	  libraries do not specify all their dependencies and require additional shared
	  libraries. In AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK, this is the fifth parameter. However, if a
	  library is specified there, it must exist on the platform, because ./configure
	  tries to compile/link/execute a small app using those statements. For example,
	  the library libdl.so is Linux specific and does not exist on BSD-like platforms.

	  Furthermore, no supported platform/version was found, which still (ever?)
	  requires those additional libraries. Therefore, they were simply removed.

	  Finally, this change adds the error code ESTRPIPE to the channel driver
	  chan_alsa for those platforms which lack it, again for example NetBSD.

	  Asterisk startup to abort.  In these cases only the most critical
	  cleanup should be performed - closing databases and terminating
	  proceses.  These cleanups are registered using ast_register_atexit, all
	  other cleanups should not be run during startup abort.

	  The main reason for this change is that these cleanup procedures are
	  untestable from the partially initialized states, if they fail it could
	  prevent us from ever running the critical cleanup with ast_run_atexits.

	  Create separate initialization for dns_core.c to be run unconditionally
	  during startup instead of being initialized by the first dns resolver to
	  be registered. This ensures that 'sched' is initialized before it can be
	  potentially used.

	  Replace ast_register_atexit with ast_register_cleanup in media_cache.c.
	  There is no reason for this cleanup to happen unconditionally.

	* install_prereq: Update FreeBSD libraries.

	  Because the code review system Gerrit creates merge conflicts even when one line
	  apart another change happened, the previous update to the FreeBSD libraries had
	  to be rebased via Git. Because of a break for training of the original
	  contributor, this rebase was done by another contributor and the variant for
	  Asterisk 13 was cherry-picked to all branches. By this, dependencies for new
	  features added in newer Asterisk version got lost. This can be seen, when not
	  the original path set but a previous patch set is compared.

	  This change here fixes this by adding those (optional) dependencies for
	  Asterisk 15 and newer (again).

	* BuildSystem: For consistency, avoid double-checking via if clauses.

	  In the script ./configure, AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK and AST_PKG_CONFIG_CHECK first test

	  line below is redundant, if exactly the same parameter 1 is used again.

	  No performance gain is expected by this change. However, because this strategy
	  is used all over in ./configure except for two places, this change aims to
	  create more consistency: Only do something different if there is a reason to do
	  so.

	  The pool cache gets in the way of finding use after free errors of memory

	  To disable the pool caching simply disable the cache_pools option in

	* AST-2018-005: Fix tdata leaks when calling pjsip_endpt_send_response(2)

	  pjsip_distributor:
	     authenticate() creates a tdata and uses it to send a challenge or
	     failure response.  When pjsip_endpt_send_response2() succeeds, it
	     automatically decrements the tdata ref count but when it fails, it
	     doesn't.  Since we weren't checking for a return status, we weren't
	     decrementing the count ourselves on error and were therefore leaking
	     tdatas.

	  res_pjsip_session:
	     session_reinvite_on_rx_request wasn't decrementing the ref count
	     if an error happened while sending a 491 response.
	     pre_session_setup wasn't decrementing the ref count if
	     while sending an error after a pjsip_inv_verify_request failure.

	  res_pjsip:
	     ast_sip_send_response wasn't decrementing the ref count on error.

	* AST-2018-004: Restrict the number of Accept headers in a SUBSCRIBE.

	  When receiving a SUBSCRIBE request the Accept headers from it are
	  stored locally. This operation has a fixed limit of 32 Accept headers
	  but this limit was not enforced. As a result it was possible for
	  memory outside of the allocated space to get written to resulting
	  in a crash.

	  processed.

	* AST-2018-001: rtp / channel: Don't allow an unnegotiated format to be passed up.

	  When an RTP packet is received by an RTP engine it has to map the
	  payload into the Asterisk format. The code was incorrectly checking
	  our own static list for ALL payloads if it couldn't find a negotiated one.
	  This included dynamic payloads. If the payload mapped to a format
	  of a different type (for example receiving a video packet on an audio
	  RTP instance) then the core stream code could cause a crash if a legacy
	  channel driver was in use as no stream would be present.

	  To provide further protection the core stream code will no longer assume
	  that a video or audio frame will always have a stream for legacy channel
	  drivers. If no stream is present the frame is dropped.

	  When constructing a dialog-info+xml NOTIFY message a ringing channel
	  is found if the state is ringing and further information is placed into

	  not always work as expected.

	  This change raises a second ringing event in such a way to guarantee
	  that the event is received by chan_sip and another lookup is done to
	  find the ringing channel.

	* bridge_softmix.c: Report not talking immediately when muted.

	  Currently in app_confbridge if someone mutes a channel while that channel
	  is talking, the talk detection code is suspended while the channel is
	  muted.  As far an an external observer is concerned, the muted channel's
	  talk status is still "talking" even though the channel is not contributing
	  audio to the conference bridge.  When the channel is later unmuted, it
	  takes the usual 'dsp_silence_threshold' option time to clear the talking
	  status even though the channel may have stopped talking while the channel
	  was muted.

	  * In bridge_softmix.c, clear the talking status and report talking stopped
	  if the channel was talking when the channel is muted.  When the channel is
	  unmuted and the channel is still talking then report the channel as
	  talking since it is contributing audio to the bridge again.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Prune subs with reliable transports at startup

	  In an earlier release, inbound registrations on a reliable transport
	  were pruned on Asterisk restart since the TCP connection would have
	  been torn down and become unusable when Asterisk stopped.  This same
	  process is now also applied to inbound subscriptions.

	  Also fixed issues in res_pjsip_registrar where it wasn't handling the
	  monitoring correctly when multiple registrations came in over the same
	  transport.

	  To accomplish this, the pjsip_transport_event feature needed to
	  be refactored to allow multiple monitors (multiple subcriptions or
	  registrations from the same endpoint) to exist on the same transport.
	  Since this changed the API, any external modules that may have used the
	  transport monitor feature (highly unlikey) will need to be changed.

	* res_pjsip: Split type=identify to IP address and SIP header matching priorities

	  The type=identify endpoint identification method can match by IP address
	  and by SIP header.  However, the SIP header matching has limited
	  usefulness because you cannot specify the SIP header matching priority
	  relative to the IP address matching.  All the matching happens at the same
	  priority and the order of evaluating the identify sections is
	  indeterminate.  e.g., If you had two type=identify sections where one
	  matches by IP address for endpoint alice and the other matches by SIP
	  header for endpoint bob then you couldn't predict which endpoint is
	  matched when a request comes in that matches both.

	  * Extract the SIP header matching criteria into its own "header" endpoint
	  identification method so the user can specify the relative priority of the
	  SIP header and the IP address matching criteria in the global
	  endpoint_identifier_order option.  The "ip" endpoint identification method
	  now only matches by IP address.

	  Since v12 the number of taskprocessors in the system has increased a lot.
	  Small systems can easily have over a hundred and larger systems can have
	  thousands.

	  Most uses of the tps_singletons container deal with creating and
	  destroying the taskprocessors.  However, the pjsip distributor looks up
	  taskprocessors/serializers by name frequently.  It needs to find the
	  serializer for incoming SIP responses to distribute them to the
	  appropriate serializer.

	  Some (normally optional) modules created notices, warnings, and even errors
	  in normal situations like (un)load. This cluttered the command-line interface

	  because their prerequisites were met at compile time. Furthermore, because of
	  ASTERISK_27475, the former talkative module 'res_curl' is built as side-effect.

	* cdr_mysql: Make sure connection charset is always set

	  When the MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT option is enabled, the MySQL client API
	  will transparently reconnect when it needs to. Ideally this simplifies
	  our code, but when this reconnection occurs all connection state is
	  lost. Because we are not notified that this has happened, we don't know
	  to set our character set again (with "SET NAMES 'xyz'").

	  Rather than calling SET NAMES, we instead set the MYSQL_SET_CHARSET_NAME
	  option which will do it for us under the hood on each connect. This
	  option has been present in the MySQL C API for at least 15 years, so it
	  should be safe for most installations.

	  I also snuck a few other changes into this patch:

	  * Default the MySQL port to MYSQL_PORT (3306) instead of 0 if it's not
	    defined.

	  Currently, to figure out specified voicemail's status, there's only one
	  way to do it, which is use a VoicemailUserEntry AMI message.
	  But it consumed it too much resource(it check everything).
	  So, added new AMI action.

	* AST-2017-012: Place single RTCP report block at beginning of report.

	  When the RTCP code was transitioned over to Stasis a code change
	  was made to keep track of how many reports are present. This count
	  controlled where report blocks were placed in the RTCP report.

	  If a compound RTCP packet was received this logic would incorrectly
	  place a report block in the wrong location resulting in a write
	  to an invalid location.

	  This change removes this counting logic and always places the report
	  block at the first position. If in the future multiple reports are
	  supported the logic can be extended but for now keeping a count
	  serves no purpose.

	* res_pjsip_session: Reinvite using active stream topology if none requested.

	  When a connected line update is sent to an endpoint we do not request
	  a specific stream topology to be used. Previously this resulted in the
	  configured stream topology being used which may actually differ from the
	  currently negotiated topology. PJSIP is helpful in this regard in that
	  it will fill in any missing streams with removed ones. This results in
	  our own state not matching the SDP, though, and we do not apply the
	  negotiated SDP.

	  This change tweaks the code to use the actively negotiated stream
	  topology if it is present with a fallback to the configured one. This
	  results in the SDP and the state having matching information and the
	  world is happy.

	* pjsip: Ignore state changes from old transactions.

	  When we fail over to a new target we create a new transaction
	  and it becomes the current INVITE transaction. This does not
	  prevent the previous transaction from raising state changes
	  and causing the session to be prematurely disconnected if a
	  transport error occurs immediately.

	  This change backports a fix from PJSIP that eliminates the
	  incorrect state change and reduces when they would be raised
	  in the first place.

	* app_queue: Fix extension state subscriptions removed on dialplan reload

	  The approach with having a single global subscription to all extension
	  state changes has one issue: dynamically created hints don't have any
	  watchers and are therefore garbage collected on the first dialplan
	  reload.

	  This change creates a state subscription for every queue member with a
	  hint as state_interface, thus increasing the count of watches for
	  hints, so they are not destroyed prematurely anymore.

	  There are 2 side effects:
	  1. The state change callback in app_queue is not executed when
	     there are no members referring to the extension.
	  2. The callback is called multiple times for the same hint if it's
	     associated with more than one queue member.

	  This patch does three things associated with the initial incoming INVITE

	  1) Add access to the full initial incoming INVITE request URI.

	  2) We were not setting DNID on incoming PJSIP channels.  The DNID is the
	  user portion of the initial incoming INVITE Request-URI.  The value is

	  3) Fix CHANNEL(pjsip,target_uri) documentation.

	  * The initial incoming INVITE request URI is now available using
	  CHANNEL(pjsip,request_uri).

	  * Set the DNID on PJSIP channel creation so CALLERID(dnid) can return the
	  initial incoming INVITE request URI user portion.

	  * CHANNEL(pjsip,target_uri) now correctly documents that the target URI is
	  the contact URI.

	  * Refactored print_escaped_uri() out of channel_read_pjsip() to handle
	  pjsip_uri_print() error condition when the buffer is too small.

	* pjsip_options: contacts sometimes not being updated on reload

	  For both dynamic and static contacts it was possible that potential AOR
	  changes were not being applied to all contacts. This was because the qualify
	  and schedule code was only retrieving AOR's, and contacts with frequencies
	  greater than zero.

	  For instance the following could happen: and AOR/contact has a frequency of 5,
	  it then gets set to 0, and then a reload occurs. All scheduled OPTIONS are
	  stopped, a list of AOR's is retrieved with frequency > 0, but none are
	  selected since in this scenario all are 0. The contact for the one previously
	  set to 5 though does not get updated, so it's status remains "AVAILABLE".

	  This patch makes it so all contacts (static and dynamic) are selected, and
	  appropriately updated if need be.

	  The sounds index is rebuilt each time a format is registered or

	  This patch significantly reduces the work done by delaying sound index

	* CDR: Fix deadlock setting some CDR values.

	  Setting channel variables with the AMI Originate action caused a deadlock
	  when you set CDR(amaflags) or CDR(accountcode).  This path has the channel
	  locked when the CDR function is called.  The CDR function then
	  synchronously passes the job to a stasis thread.  The stasis handling
	  function then attempts to lock the channel.  Deadlock results.

	  * Avoid deadlock by making the CDR function handle setting amaflags and
	  accountcode directly on the channel rather than passing it off to the CDR
	  processing code under a stasis thread to do it.

	  * Made the CHANNEL function and the CDR function process amaflags the same
	  way.

	* AST-2017-013: chan_skinny: Call pthread_detach when sess threads end

	  chan_skinny creates a new thread for each new session.  In trying
	  to be a good cleanup citizen, the threads are joinable and the
	  unload_module function does a pthread_cancel() and a pthread_join()
	  on any sessions that are active at that time.  This has an
	  unintended side effect though. Since you can call pthread_join on a
	  thread that's already terminated, pthreads keeps the thread's
	  storage around until you explicitly call pthread_join (or
	  pthread_detach()).   Since only the module_unload function was
	  calling pthread_join, and even then only on the ones active at the
	  tme, the storage for every thread/session ever created sticks
	  around until asterisk exits.

	  * A thread can detach itself so the session_destroy() function

	* config: Speed up config template lookup

	  ast_category_get() has an (undocumented) implementation detail where it
	  tries to match the category name first by an explicit pointer comparison
	  and if that fails falls back to a normal match.

	  When initially building an ast_config during ast_config_load, this
	  pointer comparison can never succeed, but we will end up iterating all
	  categories twice. As the number of categories using a template
	  increases, this dual looping becomes quite expensive. So we pass a flag
	  to category_get_sep() indicating if a pointer match is even possible
	  before trying to do so, saving us a full pass over the list of current
	  categories.

	  In my tests, loading a file with 3 template categories and 12000
	  additional categories that use those 3 templates (this file configures
	  4000 PJSIP endpoints with AOR & Auth) takes 1.2 seconds. After this
	  change, that drops to 22ms.

	* config: Speed up ACO & sorcery initialization

	  When starting Asterisk in the foreground, there is a perceptible delay
	  when loading modules that use the ACO and sorcery config frameworks.
	  For example, a lightly configured res_pjsip took 853ms to load on my
	  VM.

	  I tracked down the slowness to the XPath queries used to associate the
	  relevant documentation with the config options. One improvement was
	  adding a call to xmlXPathOrderDocElems after loading an XML document.
	  From the libxml2 docs:

	    Call this routine to speed up XPath computation on static documents.

	  The second change was to remove recursive descent and wildcard
	  operators from the XPath queries. After these changes, res_pjsip takes
	  85ms to load on my VM and there is no longer a perceptible delay when
	  starting Asterisk in the foreground.

	* translate: Transcode siren14, speex32, silk24, and silk12 via slin16.

	  When a format has no pre-recorded sound files, Asterisk has to transcode between
	  formats. For this, Asterisk has a fixed translation table. If the pre-recorded
	  sound files are not available in the same sample rate, Asterisk has not only to
	  transcode but also to resample.

	  Asterisk has pre-recorded files for SLN (8000 kHz) and SLN16 (16000 kHz).
	  However before this change, Asterisk did not take the sample rate into account,
	  because the translation paths to SLN and SLN16 got the same score/weight in the
	  table. Consequently, you might have got narrow-band audio with siren14, speex32,
	  silk24, and silk12 although those are (ultra) wide-band audio codecs.

	  With this change, the distance in sample-rates is taken into account. Now on the
	  Command-Line interface (CLI) 'core show channels', you should see:
	  (slin@16000)->(slin@32000)->(speex@32000).

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix rtp source address learning for broken clients

	  Some clients do not send rtp packets every ptime ms. This can lead to
	  situations in which the rtp source learning algorithm will never learn
	  the address of the client. This has been discovered on a Mac mini with
	  a pjsip based softphone after updating to Sierra: as soon as USB
	  headsets are involved, the softphone will send the second packet 30ms
	  after the first, the third 30ms after the second and the fourth 1ms
	  after the third. So in the old implmentation the rtp source learning
	  algorithm was repeatedly reset on the fourth packet.

	  The patch changes the algorithm in a way that doesn't take the arrival
	  time between two consecutive packets into account but the time between
	  the first and the last packet of a learning sequence.

	  The patch also fixes a second problem: when a user was using a wrong
	  value for the probation setting there was a LOG_WARNING output stating
	  that the value had been set to the default value instead. However
	  the code for setting the value back to defaults was missing.

	  menuselect detects compiler support for multiple styles of weak
	  functions.  This is a remnant from 2013 when OPTIONAL_API required weak
	  functions.  It is no longer correct for menuselect to switch
	  dependencies from optional to required based on lack of weak function
	  support.

	  Note an issue remains - dependencies should switch from optional to
	  required based on OPTIONAL_API being enabled or disabled.  I don't think
	  this is possible.  menuselect needs to know at startup if OPTIONAL_API
	  is enabled or disabled, so the only way to fix this is to remove
	  OPTIONAL_API from menuselect and create a configure option.  I've left
	  the code that switches in place but it's preprocessed out.

	  Additionally removed:
	  - WEAKREF variable from Asterisk makeopts.in.
	  - Related disabled code from test_utils.
	  - Pointless AC_REVISION call from menuselect/configure.ac.

	* bridge_basic: Ignore answer from transfer target when they've timed out.

	  This is a fun one.

	  Given the following attended transfer scenario:

	  1. Transfer target is called
	  2. Transferer hangs up
	  3. Transfer target call attempt reaches timeout
	  4. Transfer target is told to hang up
	  5. Transfer target answers before channel is hung up
	  6. Transferer recall target is called

	  A crash would occur. This is because the transfer target call
	  attempt, despite being told to hang up, would raise a recall
	  target answer before the recall target had been answered. As it
	  had not answered there would be no recall target channel and it
	  would implode.

	  This change makes it so that if the transfer target has been
	  hung up we don't tell the attended transfer code that it has
	  answered. We also clear out the stimulus that the recall target
	  has been answered after telling the transfer target to hang up,
	  in case it was able to raise the information before we told it
	  to hangup.

	  The PJSIP HEP support has also been tweaked so that reliable

	  and do not try to (wrongly) guess. As they are connection
	  based it is impossible for the source to be anything else.

	* core: Add cache_media_frames debugging option.

	  The media frame cache gets in the way of finding use after free errors of
	  media frames.  Tools like valgrind and MALLOC_DEBUG don't know when a
	  frame is released because it gets put into the cache instead of being
	  freed.

	  * Added the "cache_media_frames" option to asterisk.conf.  Disabling the
	  option helps track down media frame mismanagement when using valgrind or
	  MALLOC_DEBUG.  The cache gets in the way of determining if the frame is
	  used after free and who freed it.  NOTE: This option has no effect when
	  Asterisk is compiled with the LOW_MEMORY compile time option enabled
	  because the cache code does not exist.

	  To disable the media frame cache simply disable the cache_media_frames
	  option in asterisk.conf and restart Asterisk.

	  Sample asterisk.conf setting:
	  [options]
	  cache_media_frames=no

	  If a transport is created with the same transport type, source

	  transport is moved into a linked list called "tp_list".

	  If this old transport is later shutdown it will not be destroyed
	  as the process checks whether the transport is valid or not. This
	  check does not look at the "tp_list" when making the determination

	* AST-2017-011 - res_pjsip_session: session leak when a call is rejected

	  A previous commit made it so when an invite session transitioned into a
	  disconnected state destruction of the Asterisk pjsip session object was
	  postponed until either a transport error occurred or the event timer
	  expired. However, if a call was rejected (for instance a 488) before the
	  session was fully established the event timer may not have been initiated,
	  or it was canceled without triggering either of the session finalizing states
	  mentioned above.

	  Really the only time destruction of the session should be delayed is when a
	  BYE is being transacted. This is because it's possible in some cases for the
	  session to be disconnected, but the BYE is still transacting.

	  This patch makes it so the session object always gets released (no more
	  memory leak) when the pjsip session is in a disconnected state. Except when
	  the method is a BYE. Then it waits until a transport error occurs or an event
	  timeout.

	* AST-2017-009: pjproject: Add validation of numeric header values

	  Parsing the numeric header fields like cseq, ttl, port, etc. all
	  had the potential to overflow, either causing unintended values to
	  be captured or, if the values were subsequently converted back to
	  strings, a buffer overrun.  To address this, new "strto" functions
	  have been created that do range checking and those functions are
	  used wherever possible in the parser.

	   * Created pjlib/include/limits.h and pjlib/include/compat/limits.h
	     to either include the system limits.h or define common numeric
	     limits if there is no system limits.h.

	   * Created strto*_validate functions in sip_parser that take bounds
	     and on failure call the on_str_parse_error function which prints
	     an error message and calls PJ_THROW.

	   * Updated sip_parser to validate the numeric fields.

	   * Fixed an issue in sip_transport that prevented error messages
	     from being properly displayed.

	   * Added "volatile" to some variables referenced in PJ_CATCH blocks
	     as the optimizer was sometimes optimizing them away.

	* Fix ast_(v)asprintf() malloc failure usage conditions.

	  When (v)asprintf() fails, the state of the allocated buffer is undefined.
	  The library had better not leave an allocated buffer as a result or no one
	  will know to free it.  The most likely way it can return failure is for an
	  allocation failure.  If the printf conversion fails then you actually have
	  a threading problem which is much worse because another thread modified
	  the parameter values.

	  * Made __ast_asprintf()/__ast_vasprintf() set the returned buffer to NULL
	  on failure.  That is much more useful than either an uninitialized pointer
	  or a pointer that has already been freed.  Many uses won't have to check
	  for failure to ensure that the buffer won't be double freed or prevent an
	  attempt to free an uninitialized pointer.

	  rtp_ipv6 was set and ast_sip_get_host_ip_string returned an ipv6

	* bridge_softmix: Reduce topology cloning and improve renegotiation.

	  As channels join and leave an SFU the bridge_softmix module
	  needs to renegotiate to add and remove their streams from
	  the other participants. Previously this was done by constructing
	  the ideal stream topology every time but in the case of leave
	  this was incomplete.

	  This change makes it so bridge_softmix keeps an ideal stream
	  topology for each channel and uses it when making changes. This
	  ensures that when we request a renegotiation we are always
	  certain that we are aiming for the best stream topology
	  possible. In the case of a channel leaving this ensures that
	  we try to have an existing participant fill their place if
	  a participant has a fixed limit on the maximum number of video
	  streams they allow.

	* res_calendar_icalendar: Filter out occurrences superceded by another VEVENT

	  When we are loading the calendars, we call libical's
	  icalcomponent_foreach_recurrence method for each VEVENT component that
	  we have in our calendar.

	  That method has no knowledge concerning the existence of the other
	  VEVENT components and will feed our callback with all ocurrences
	  matching the requested time span.

	  The occurrences generated by icalcomponent_foreach_recurrence while
	  expanding a recurring VEVENT's RRULE and RDATE properties can be
	  superceded by an other VEVENT sharing the same UID.

	  I use an external iterator (in libical terminology) to avoid messing
	  with the internal ones from the calling function, and search for
	  VEVENTS which could supersede the current occurrence.

	  The event which can invalidate this occurence needs to have:

	  - the same UID as our recurrent component (comp)
	  - a RECURRENCE-ID property, which represents the start time of this
	    occurrence

	  If one component is found, just clean and return.

	  The "res_pjsip:  Filter out non SIP(S) requests" commit moved the

	  in order to filter out incoming bad uri schemes as early as possible.
	  Since the change affected outgoing messages as well and the TRANSPORT
	  layer is the last to be run on outgoing messages, we were overwriting
	  the setting of external_signaling_address (which is set earlier by
	  res_pjsip_nat) with an internal address.

	  * pjsip_message_filter now registers itself as a pjproject module
	  twice.  Once in the TSX layer for the outgoing messages (as it was

	  incoming messages to catch the invalid uri schemes.

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix bridge_p2p_rtp_write() reentrancy potential.

	  The bridge_p2p_rtp_write() has potential reentrancy problems.

	  * Accessing the bridged RTP members must be done with the instance1 lock
	  held.  The DTMF and asymmetric codec checks must be split to be done with
	  the correct RTP instance struct locked.  i.e., They must be done when
	  working on the appropriate side of the point to point bridge.

	  * Forcing the RTP mark bit was referencing the wrong side of the point to
	  point bridge.  The set mark bit is used everywhere else to set the mark
	  bit when sending not receiving.

	  The patches for ASTERISK_26745 and ASTERISK_27158 did not take into
	  account that not everything carried by RTP uses a codec.  The telephony
	  DTMF events are not exchanged with a codec.  As a result when
	  RFC2833/RFC4733 sent digits you would crash if "core set debug 1" is
	  enabled, the DTMF digits would always get passed to the core even though
	  the local native RTP bridge is active, and the DTMF digits would go out
	  using the wrong SSRC id.

	  * Add protection for non-format payload types like DTMF when updating the
	  lastrxformat and lasttxformat.  Also protect against non-format payload
	  types when checking for asymmetric codecs.

	* res_pjsip_session: outgoing call did not offer all configured codecs

	  For some scenarios when an outgoing call was made only a subset of the
	  configured codecs were offered. If the codecs being offered happened to
	  not have a codec supported by the phone then the call would fail.

	  For instance Alice and Bob both are configured in Asterisk for g722 and ulaw(
	  allow=!all,g722,ulaw). Alice's endpoint however only supports g722 while Bob's
	  only supports ulaw. When Alice calls Bob, Alice negotiates g722 fine with
	  Asterisk. But when Asterisk sends the outgoing offer to Bob it only contains
	  g722 and not both g722 and ulaw, so the call ends.

	  This patch makes it so all the audio codecs configured on the endpoint always
	  get sent, and not just a subset. However priority is given to those codecs that
	  are compatible with the "other side".

	* app_queue: Only do announcement logic between ringing cycles

	  This patch reverts the change by patch 2263 from old reviewboard.
	  Note that reverting that 2263-patch still preserves the behaviour that
	  the commit log of the 2263-patch claimed to add. The reason for this is:

	  The function wait_for_answer is only called from try_calling which
	  in turn is only called from the main for loop in queue_exec, and
	  earlier in that loop we already check the things that's removed by
	  this patch. There's no need to check those things twice each loop
	  iteration, and I think the proper place to check it is before each
	  ringing cycle. By checking it in wait_for_answer, you allow the issue
	  explained in the jira - that the head caller hears announcements while
	  the agents' sip phones are actively ringing.

	* res_pjsip_session: Reduce (and improve) SDP renegotiation.

	  When pruning a request to change the topology of a channel be
	  more intelligent about the resulting topology that is actually
	  used for SDP renegotiation.

	  In a case where a stream has not already been negotiated we
	  don't need to renegotiate and offer a declined stream. This can
	  occur if something in Asterisk (such as ConfBridge) requests
	  to add video to a PJSIP channel that has no video codecs configured.
	  In this case since the stream did not already exist we can safely
	  remove the stream from the requested topology, resulting in no
	  renegotiation occurring.

	  In a case where a renegotiation is requested with a codec that is
	  not supported we can reuse the formats of the existing stream if
	  it exists to ensure that the stream continues to flow, instead of
	  removing it.

	* res_pjsip_session: Don't end session when receiving a 500 on a reinvite

	  During a reinvite, if a remote endpoint error occurs and it returns a 500 the
	  session would end. This patch makes it so the session is not terminated, but
	  continues as it was.

	  The reason for this is because some endpoints may send non session terminating
	  "server errors" like a failed codec negotiation. So in this case instead of
	  ending the call it can hopefully continue. In the case of a real server error
	  the session is already "doomed", will be known soon enough and appropriately
	  ended by Asterisk later.

	  when the video stream was processed and tried to use the transport,

	* bridge: Change participant SFU streams when source streams change.

	  Some endpoints do not like a stream being reused for a new
	  media stream. The frame/jitterbuffer can rely on underlying
	  attributes of the media stream in order to order the packets.
	  When a new stream takes its place without any notice the
	  buffer can get confused and the media ends up getting dropped.

	  This change uses the SSRC change to determine that a new source
	  is reusing an existing stream and then bridge_softmix renegotiates
	  each participant such that they see a new media stream. This
	  causes the frame/jitterbuffer to start fresh and work as expected.

	  and off hold.

	  The new algorithm learns remote addresses for a set time (1.5 seconds)
	  before locking the remote address.  In addition, we must see a configured
	  number of remote packets from the same address in a row before switching.

	  * WaitForSilence completes successfully if it receives no media in the
	    specified timeout, but when acting as WaitForNoise that logic needs
	    to be reversed.

	  * Use standard argument parsing macros and add some error checking for
	    invalid values.

	  * The documentation indicated that the first argument to both
	    WaitForSilence and WaitForNoise was required when it was not. Update
	    the documentation to reflect that.

	  * Wrap up some behavior in structs to avoid boolean checks all over the
	    place.

	* chan_sip: when getting sip pvt return failure if not found

	  In handle_request_invite, when processing a pickup, a call
	  is made to get_sip_pvt_from_replaces to locate the pvt for
	  the subscription. The pvt is assumed to be valid when zero
	  is returned indicating no error, and is dereferenced which
	  can cause a crash if it was not found.

	  This change checks the not found case and returns -1 which
	  allows the calling code to fail appropriately.

	* stasis/control:  Fix possible deadlock with swap channel

	  If an error occurs during a bridge impart it's possible that
	  the "bridge_after" callback might try to run before
	  control_swap_channel_in_bridge has been signalled to continue.
	  Since control_swap_channel_in_bridge is holding the control lock
	  and the callback needs it, a deadlock will occur.

	  * control_swap_channel_in_bridge now only holds the control
	    lock while it's actually modifying the control structure and
	    releases it while the bridge impart is running.
	  * bridge_after_cb is now tolerant of impart failures.

	* chan_sip: Do not change IP address in SDP origin line (o=) in SIP reINVITE

	  If directmedia=yes is configured, when call is answered, Asterisk sends reINVITE
	  to both parties to set up media path directly between the endpoints.
	  In this reINVITE msg SDP origin line (o=) contains IP address of endpoint
	  instead of IP of asterisk. This behavior violates RFC3264, sec 8:
	  "When issuing an offer that modifies the session,
	  the "o=" line of the new SDP MUST be identical to that in the
	  previous SDP, except that the version in the origin field MUST
	  increment by one from the previous SDP."
	  This patch assures IP address of Asterisk is always sent in
	  SDP origin line.

	* res/res_pjsip: Standardize/fix localnet checks across pjsip.

	  In 2dee95cc (ASTERISK-27024) and 776ffd77 (ASTERISK-26879) there was
	  confusion about whether the transport_state->localnet ACL has ALLOW or
	  DENY semantics.

	  For the record: the localnet has DENY semantics, meaning that "not in
	  the list" means ALLOW, and the local nets are in the list.

	  Therefore, checks like this look wrong, but are right:

	      /* See if where we are sending this request is local or not, and if
	         not that we can get a Contact URI to modify */
	      if (ast_apply_ha(transport_state->localnet, &addr) != AST_SENSE_ALLOW) {
	          ast_debug(5, "Request is being sent to local address, "
	                       "skipping NAT manipulation\n");

	  (In the list == localnet == DENY == skip NAT manipulation.)

	  And conversely, other checks that looked right, were wrong.

	  This change adds two macro's to reduce the confusion and uses those
	  instead:

	      ast_sip_transport_is_nonlocal(transport_state, addr)
	      ast_sip_transport_is_local(transport_state, addr)

	* AST-2017-006: Fix app_minivm application MinivmNotify command injection

	  An admin can configure app_minivm with an externnotify program to be run
	  when a voicemail is received.  The app_minivm application MinivmNotify
	  uses ast_safe_system() for this purpose which is vulnerable to command
	  injection since the Caller-ID name and number values given to externnotify
	  can come from an external untrusted source.

	  * Add ast_safe_execvp() function.  This gives modules the ability to run
	  external commands with greater safety compared to ast_safe_system().
	  Specifically when some parameters are filled by untrusted sources the new
	  function does not allow malicious input to break argument encoding.  This
	  may be of particular concern where CALLERID(name) or CALLERID(num) may be
	  used as a parameter to a script run by ast_safe_system() which could
	  potentially allow arbitrary command execution.

	  * Changed app_minivm.c:run_externnotify() to use the new ast_safe_execvp()
	  instead of ast_safe_system() to avoid command injection.

	  * Document code injection potential from untrusted data sources for other
	  shell commands that are under user control.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Only learn a new source in learn state.

	  This change moves the logic which learns a new source address
	  for RTP so it only occurs in the learning state. The learning
	  state is entered on initial allocation of RTP or if we are
	  told that the remote address for the media has changed. While
	  in the learning state if we continue to receive media from
	  the original source we restart the learning process. It is
	  only once we receive a sufficient number of RTP packets from
	  the new source that we will switch to it. Once this is done
	  the closed state is entered where all packets that do not
	  originate from the expected source are dropped.

	  The learning process has also been improved to take into
	  account the time between received packets so a flood of them
	  while in the learning state does not cause media to be switched.

	  Finally RTCP now drops packets which are not for the learned
	  SSRC if strict RTP is enabled.

	* Fix downloader not working with curl

	  The codec/dpma downloader wasn't handling curl correctly.  The logic
	  that transforms makeopts into a bash-sourceable file wasn't
	  handling the make 'or' command in DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT so bash was
	  looking for an 'or' command.

	  That logic has been eliminated.  Instead of trying to transform
	  and source makeopts, the downloader now calls a make scriptlet
	  to print the value of a specific variable.  This way, make handles
	  the ors (or any other make construct that happens to creep into
	  that file).

	* res_pjsip: Remove ephemeral registered contacts on transport shutdown.

	  The fix for the issue is broken up into three parts.

	  This is part two which handles the server side of REGISTER requests when
	  rewrite_contact is enabled.  Any registered reliable transport contact
	  becomes invalid when the transport connection becomes disconnected.

	  * Monitor the rewrite_contact's reliable transport REGISTER contact for
	  shutdown.  If it is shutdown then the contact must be removed because it
	  is no longer valid.  Otherwise, when the client attempts to re-REGISTER it
	  may be blocked because the invalid contact is there.  Also if we try to
	  send a call to the endpoint using the invalid contact then the endpoint is
	  not likely to see the request.  The endpoint either won't be listening on
	  that port for new connections or a NAT/firewall will block it.

	  * Prune any rewrite_contact's registered reliable transport contacts on
	  boot.  The reliable transport no longer exists so the contact is invalid.

	  * Websockets always rewrite the REGISTER contact address and the transport
	  needs to be monitored for shutdown.

	  * Made the websocket transport set a unique name since that is what we use
	  as the ao2 container key.  Otherwise, we would not know which transport we
	  find when one of them shuts down.  The names are also used for PJPROJECT
	  debug logging.

	  * Made the websocket transport post the PJSIP_TP_STATE_CONNECTED state
	  event.  Now the global keep_alive_interval option, initially idle shutdown
	  timer, and the server REGISTER contact monitor can work on wetsocket
	  transports.

	  * Made the websocket transport set the PJSIP_TP_DIR_INCOMING direction.
	  Now initially idle websockets will automatically shutdown.

	* chan_sip: Access incoming REFER headers in dialplan

	  This adds a way to access information passed along with SIP headers in
	  a REFER message that initiates a transfer. Headers matching a dialplan
	  variable GET_TRANSFERRER_DATA in the transferrer channel are added to
	  a HASH object TRANSFER_DATA to be accessed with functions HASHKEY and HASH.

	  The variable GET_TRANSFERRER_DATA is interpreted to be a prefix for
	  headers that should be put into the hash. If not set, no headers are
	  included. If set to a string (perhaps 'X-' in a typical case), all headers
	  starting this string are added. Empty string matches all headers.

	  If there are multiple of the same header, only the latest occurrence in
	  the REFER message is available in the hash.

	  Obviously, the variable GET_TRANSFERRER_DATA must be inherited by the
	  referrer channel, and should be set with the '_' or '__' prefix.

	  I avoided a specific reference to SIP or REFER, as in my mind the mechanism
	  can be generalized to other channel techs.

	* res_pjsip_session/_sdp_rtp: Handling of 'msid' is incorrect

	  Currently, the handling of the msid attribute is not quite right. According to

	  Meaning the same msid's given in an offer do not have to be returned in the

	  this can potentially cause some browser side confusion.

	  This patch generates new msids when both an offer and answer are sent from

	  reinvite. Also audio+video streams are paired together by sharing the same
	  stream id, but a different track id.

	  The seconds and minutes files have always existed in the base language

	* bridge_softmix / res_rtp_asterisk: Fix packet loss and renegotiation issues.

	  This change does a few things to improve packet loss and renegotiation:

	  1. On outgoing RTP streams we will now properly reflect out of order
	  packets and packet loss in the sequence number. This allows the
	  remote jitterbuffer to better reorder things.

	  2. Video updates can now be discarded for a period of time
	  after one has been sent to prevent flooding of clients.

	  3. For declined and removed streams we will now release any
	  media session resources associated with them. This was not
	  previously done and caused an issue where old state was being
	  used for a new stream.

	  4. RTP bundling was not actually removing bundled RTP instances
	  from the parent. This has been resolved by removing based on
	  the RTP instance itself and not the SSRC.

	  5. The code did not properly handle explicitly unbundling an
	  RTP instance from its parent. This now works as expected.

	* SDP: Rework SDP offer/answer model and update capabilities merges.

	  The SDP offer/answer model requires an answer to an offer before a new SDP
	  can be processed.  This allows our local SDP creation to be deferred until
	  we know that we need to create an offer or an answer SDP.  Once the local
	  SDP is created it won't change until the SDP negotiation is restarted.

	  An offer SDP in an initial SIP INVITE can receive more than one answer
	  SDP.  In this case, we need to merge each answer SDP with our original
	  offer capabilities to get the currently negotiated capabilities.  To
	  satisfy this requirement means that we cannot update our proposed
	  capabilities until the negotiations are restarted.

	  Local topology updates from ast_sdp_state_update_local_topology() are
	  merged together until the next offer SDP is created.  These accumulated
	  updates are then merged with the current negotiated capabilities to create
	  the new proposed capabilities that the offer SDP is built.

	  Local topology updates are merged in several passes to attempt to be smart
	  about how streams from the system are matched with the previously
	  negotiated stream slots.  To allow for T.38 support when merging, type
	  matching considers audio and image types to be equivalent.  First streams
	  are matched by stream name and type.  Then streams are matched by stream
	  type only.  Any remaining unmatched existing streams are declined.  Any
	  new active streams are either backfilled into pre-merge declined slots or
	  appended onto the end of the merged topology.  Any excess new streams
	  above the maximum supported number of streams are simply discarded.

	  Remote topology negotiation merges depend if the topology is an offer or
	  answer.  An offer remote topology negotiation dictates the stream slot
	  ordering and new streams can be added.  A remote offer can do anything to
	  the previously negotiated streams except reduce the number of stream
	  slots.  An answer remote topology negotiation is limited to what our offer
	  requested.  The answer can only decline streams, pick codecs from the
	  offered list, or indicate the remote's stream hold state.

	  I had originally kept the RTP instance if the remote offer SDP changed a
	  stream type between audio and video since they both use RTP.  However, I
	  later removed this support in favor of simply creating a new RTP instance
	  since the stream's purpose has to be changing anyway.  Any RTP packets
	  from the old stream type might cause mischief for the bridged peer.

	  * Added ast_sdp_state_restart_negotiations() to restart the SDP
	  offer/answer negotiations.  We will thus know to create a new local SDP
	  when it is time to create an offer or answer.

	  * Removed ast_sdp_state_reset().  Save the current topology before
	  starting T.38.  To recover from T.38 simply update the local topology to
	  the saved topology and restart the SDP negotiations to get the offer SDP
	  renegotiating the previous configuration.

	  * Allow initial topology for ast_sdp_state_alloc() to be NULL so an
	  initial remote offer SDP can dictate the streams we start with.  We can
	  always update the local topology later if it turns out we need to offer
	  SDP first because the remote chose to defer sending us a SDP.

	  * Made the ast_sdp_state_alloc() initial topology limit to max_streams,
	  limit to configured codecs, handle declined streams, and discard
	  unsupported types.

	  * Convert struct ast_sdp to ao2 object.  Needed to easily save off a
	  remote SDP to refer to later for various reasons such as generating
	  declined m= lines in the local SDP.

	  * Improve converting remote SDP streams to a topology including stream
	  state.  A stream state of AST_STREAM_STATE_REMOVED indicates the stream is
	  declined/dead.

	  * Improve merging streams to take into account the stream state.

	  * Added query for remote hold state.

	  * Added maximum streams allowed SDP config option.

	  * Added ability to create new streams as needed.  New streams are created
	  with configured default audio, video, or image codecs depending on stream
	  type.

	  * Added global locally_held state along with a per stream local hold
	  state.  Historically, Asterisk only has a global locally held state
	  because when the we put the remote on hold we do it for all active
	  streams.

	  * Added queries for a rejected offer and current SDP negotiation role.
	  The rejected query allows the using module to know how to respond to a
	  failed remote SDP set.  Should the using module respond with a 488 Not
	  Acceptable Here or 500 Internal Error to the offer SDP?

	  * Moved sdp_state_capabilities.connection_address to ast_sdp_state.  There
	  seems no reason to keep it in the sdp_state_capabilities struct since it
	  was only used by the ast_sdp_state.proposed_capabilities instance.

	  * Callbacks are now available to allow the using module some customization
	  of negotiated streams and to complete setting up streams for use.  See the
	  typedef doxygen for each callback for what is allowable and when they are
	  called.
	      * Added topology answerer modify callback.
	      * Added topology pre and post apply callbacks.
	      * Added topology offerer modify callback.
	      * Added topology offerer configure callback.

	  * Had to rework the unit tests because I changed how SDP topologies are
	  merged.  Replaced several unit tests with new negotiation tests.

	* AST-2017-006: Fix app_minivm application MinivmNotify command injection

	  An admin can configure app_minivm with an externnotify program to be run
	  when a voicemail is received.  The app_minivm application MinivmNotify
	  uses ast_safe_system() for this purpose which is vulnerable to command
	  injection since the Caller-ID name and number values given to externnotify
	  can come from an external untrusted source.

	  * Add ast_safe_execvp() function.  This gives modules the ability to run
	  external commands with greater safety compared to ast_safe_system().
	  Specifically when some parameters are filled by untrusted sources the new
	  function does not allow malicious input to break argument encoding.  This
	  may be of particular concern where CALLERID(name) or CALLERID(num) may be
	  used as a parameter to a script run by ast_safe_system() which could
	  potentially allow arbitrary command execution.

	  * Changed app_minivm.c:run_externnotify() to use the new ast_safe_execvp()
	  instead of ast_safe_system() to avoid command injection.

	  * Document code injection potential from untrusted data sources for other
	  shell commands that are under user control.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Only learn a new source in learn state.

	  This change moves the logic which learns a new source address
	  for RTP so it only occurs in the learning state. The learning
	  state is entered on initial allocation of RTP or if we are
	  told that the remote address for the media has changed. While
	  in the learning state if we continue to receive media from
	  the original source we restart the learning process. It is
	  only once we receive a sufficient number of RTP packets from
	  the new source that we will switch to it. Once this is done
	  the closed state is entered where all packets that do not
	  originate from the expected source are dropped.

	  The learning process has also been improved to take into
	  account the time between received packets so a flood of them
	  while in the learning state does not cause media to be switched.

	  Finally RTCP now drops packets which are not for the learned
	  SSRC if strict RTP is enabled.

	  to print the value of a specific variable.  This way, make handles
	  the ors (or any other make construct that happens to creep into
	  that file).

	* manager: hook event is not being raised

	  When the iostream code went in it introduced a conditional that made it so the
	  hook event was not being raised even if a hook is present. This patch adds a
	  check to see if a hook is present in astman_append. If so then call into the
	  send_string function, which in turn raises the even for specified hook.

	  Also updated the ami hooks unit test, so the test could be automated.

	* res_pjsip_session/_sdp_rtp: Handling of 'msid' is incorrect

	  Currently, the handling of the msid attribute is not quite right. According to
	  the spec the msid's between the offer/answer are not dependent upon one another.
	  Meaning the same msid's given in an offer do not have to be returned in the
	  answer for a given stream. And they probably shouldn't be (copied/reused) since
	  this can potentially cause some browser side confusion.

	  This patch generates new msids when both an offer and answer are sent from
	  Asterisk. However, Asterisk does reuse the original msid it sent out for a
	  reinvite. Also audio+video streams are paired together by sharing the same
	  stream id, but a different track id.

	  This change fixes PIDF content generation when the underlying device
	  state is considered in use. Previously it was incorrectly marked
	  as closed meaning they were offline/unavailable. The code now
	  correctly marks them as open.

	  Additionally:

	    * Generate an XML element for our activity instead of a using a text
	      node.

	    * Consider every extension state other than "unavailable" to be 'open'
	      status.

	    * Update the XML namespaces and structure to reflect those
	      documented in RFC 4480

	    * Use 'on-the-phone' (defined in RFC 4880) instead of 'busy' as the
	      "in use" activity. This change results in eyeBeam using the
	      appropriate icon for the watched user.

	* bridge_softmix / res_rtp_asterisk: Fix packet loss and renegotiation issues.

	  This change does a few things to improve packet loss and renegotiation:

	  1. On outgoing RTP streams we will now properly reflect out of order
	  packets and packet loss in the sequence number. This allows the
	  remote jitterbuffer to better reorder things.

	  2. Video updates can now be discarded for a period of time
	  after one has been sent to prevent flooding of clients.

	  3. For declined and removed streams we will now release any
	  media session resources associated with them. This was not
	  previously done and caused an issue where old state was being
	  used for a new stream.

	  4. RTP bundling was not actually removing bundled RTP instances
	  from the parent. This has been resolved by removing based on
	  the RTP instance itself and not the SSRC.

	  5. The code did not properly handle explicitly unbundling an
	  RTP instance from its parent. This now works as expected.

	* res_rtp_asterisk / res_pjsip: Add support for BUNDLE.

	  BUNDLE is a specification used in WebRTC to allow multiple
	  streams to use the same underlying transport. This reduces
	  the number of ICE and DTLS negotiations that has to occur
	  to 1 normally.

	  This change implements this by adding support for it to
	  the RTP SDP module in PJSIP. BUNDLE can be turned on using
	  the "bundle" option and on an offer we will offer to
	  bundle streams together. On an answer we will accept any
	  bundle groups provided. Once accepted each stream is bundled
	  to another RTP instance for transport.

	  For the res_rtp_asterisk changes the ability to bundle
	  an RTP instance to another based on the SSRC received
	  from the remote side has been added. For outgoing traffic
	  if an RTP instance is bundled to another we will use the
	  other RTP instance for any transport related things. For
	  incoming traffic received from the transport instance we
	  look up the correct instance based on the SSRC and use it
	  for any non-transport related data.

	* bridge/core_unreal: Fix SFU bugs with forwarding frames.

	  This change fixes a few things uncovered during SFU testing.

	  1. Unreal channels incorrectly forwarded video frames when
	  no video stream was present on them. This caused a crash when
	  they were read as the core requires a stream to exist for the
	  underlying media type. The Unreal channel will now ensure a
	  stream exists for the media type before forwarding the frame
	  and if no stream exists then the frame is dropped.

	  2. Mapping of frames during bridging from the stream number of
	  the underlying channel to the stream number of the bridge was
	  done in the wrong location. This resulted in the frame getting
	  dropped. This mapping now occurs on reading of the frame from
	  the channel.

	  3. Bridging was using the wrong ast_read function resulting in
	  it living in a non-multistream world.

	  4. In bridge_softmix when adding new streams to existing channels
	  the wrong stream topology was copied resulting in no streams
	  being added.

	* res_musiconhold:  Add kill_escalation_delay, kill_method to class

	  By default, when res_musiconhold reloads or unloads, it sends a HUP
	  signal to custom applications (and all descendants), waits 100ms,
	  then sends a TERM signal, waits 100ms, then finally sends a KILL
	  signal.  An application which is interacting with an external
	  device and/or spawns children of its own may not be able to exit
	  cleanly in the default times, expecially if sent a KILL signal, or
	  if it's children are getting signals directly from
	  res_musiconhoild.

	  * To allow extra time, the 'kill_escalation_delay'
	    class option can be used to set the number of milliseconds
	    res_musiconhold waits before escalating kill signals, with the
	    default being the current 100ms.

	  * To control to whom the signals are sent, the "kill_method" class
	    option can be set to "process_group" (the default, existing
	    behavior), which sends signals to the application and its
	    descendants directly, or "process" which sends signals only to the
	    application itself.

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix TURN deadlock by using ICE session group lock.

	  When a message is received on the TURN socket, the code processing the
	  message needs to call into the ICE/STUN session for further processing.
	  This code path locks the TURN group lock then the ICE/STUN group lock.  In
	  another thread an ICE/STUN timer can fire off to send a keep alive message
	  over the TURN socket.  In this code path, the ICE/STUN group lock is
	  obtained then the TURN group lock is obtained to send the packet.  A
	  classic deadlock case if the group locks are not the same.

	  * Made TURN get created using the ICE/STUN session's group lock.

	  NOTE: I was originally concerned that the ICE/STUN session can get
	  recreated by ice_reset_session() for an event like RTCP multiplexing
	  causing a change during SDP negotiation.  In this case the TURN group lock
	  would become different.  However, TURN is also recreated as part of the
	  ICE/STUN recreation in ice_create() when all known ICE candidates are
	  added to the new ICE session.  While the ICE/STUN and TURN sessions are
	  being recreated there is a period where the group locks could be
	  different.

	* pjsip_distributor.c: Fix deadlock with TCP type transports.

	  When a SIP message comes in on a transport, pjproject obtains the lock on
	  the transport and pulls the data out of the socket.  Unlike UDP, the TCP
	  transport does not allow concurrent access.  Without concurrency the
	  transport lock is not released when the transport's message complete
	  callback is called.  The processing continues and eventually Asterisk
	  starts processing the SIP message.  The first thing Asterisk tries to do
	  is determine the associated dialog of the message to determine the
	  associated serializer.  To get the associated serializer safely requires
	  us to get the dialog lock.

	  To send a request or response message for a dialog, pjproject obtains the
	  dialog lock and then obtains the transport lock.  Deadlock can result
	  because of the opposite order the locks are obtained.

	  * Fix the deadlock by obtaining the serializer associated with the dialog
	  another way that doesn't involve obtaining the dialog lock.  In this case,
	  we use an ao2 container to hold the associated endpoint and serializer.
	  The new locks are held a brief time and won't overlap other existing lock
	  times.

	* chan_pjsip: Add support for multiple streams of the same type.

	  The stream topology (list of streams and order) is now stored with the
	  configured PJSIP endpoints and used during the negotiation process.

	  Media negotiation state information has been changed to be stored
	  in a separate object. Two of these objects exist at any one time
	  on a session. The active media state information is what was previously
	  negotiated and the pending media state information is what the
	  media state will become if negotiation succeeds. Streams and other
	  state information is stored in this object using the index (or
	  position) of each individual stream for easy lookup.

	  The ability for a media type handler to specify a callback for
	  writing has been added as well as the ability to add file
	  descriptors with a callback which is invoked when data is available
	  to be read on them. This allows media logic to live outside of
	  the chan_pjsip module.

	  Direct media has been changed so that only the first audio and
	  video stream are directly connected. In the future once the RTP
	  engine glue API has been updated to know about streams each individual
	  stream can be directly connected as appropriate.

	  Media negotiation itself will currently answer all the provided streams
	  on an offer within configured limits and on an offer will use the
	  topology created as a result of the disallow/allow codec lines.

	  If a stream has been removed or declined we will now mark it as such
	  within the resulting SDP.

	  Applications can now also request that the stream topology change.
	  If we are told to do so we will limit any provided formats to the ones
	  configured on the endpoint and send a re-invite with the new topology.

	  Two new configuration options have also been added to PJSIP endpoints:

	  max_audio_streams: determines the maximum number of audio streams to
	  offer/accept from an endpoint. Defaults to 1.

	  max_video_streams: determines the maximum number of video streams to

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Fix issues with ICE renegotiation.

	  When re-inviting to add more streams it is possible for
	  the role of existing ICE sessions to be changed to the
	  incorrect value. This results in subsequent refreshes
	  within the sessions getting a role conflict and the ICE
	  session breaking down. This change only sets the role to
	  be the new value if an ICE renegotiation is actually
	  going to happen, otherwise the existing role is preserved.

	  As well if we encounter a situation where a unidirectional
	  ICE negotiation happens and the other side does not send us
	  candidates we will not store any information for sending
	  traffic, even though we know where they are reachable. This
	  change fixes this by using the source of the ICE traffic
	  itself as the target if no candidates are known and we
	  receive some ICE traffic.

	* core_local: local channel data not being properly unref'ed and unlocked

	  In an earlier version of Asterisk a local channel [un]lock all functions were
	  added in order to keep a crash from occurring when a channel hung up too early
	  during an attended transfer. Unfortunately, when a transfer failure occurs and
	  depending on the timing, the local channels sometime do not get properly

	  underlying local channel structure gets NULLed out before unlocking.

	  locked and ref'ed later get unlocked and deref'ed.

	* Core/PBX: Deadlock between dialplan execution and application unregistration.

	  Not easy to reproduce, but we have noticed deadlocks when unloading a module
	  while dialplan is handling a request.

	  The deadlock is between :
	  1) Dialplan execution: pbx_extension_helper() first taking conlock,
	  then pbx_findapp() [when called] asking for lock on apps list.
	  2) Application unregistration: ast_unregister_application() first taking lock
	  on apps list, then unreference_cached_app() [when called] asking for conlock.

	  As a protection, I suggest to modify ast_unregister_application(), so that it
	  anticipates the need of conlock, before taking the lock on apps list.
	  The side effect is a longer unavailability of conlock when unregistering an
	  application.

	* res_corosync: Change thread stack size

	  In Corosync 2.x libraries were changed to use LibQB IPC.
	  Sadly LibQB IPC doesn't support copy-free access to received buffer, so
	  Corosync libraries were rewritten to use stack as buffer. Mostly the
	  needed stack size is quite small, but for all *_dispatch functions, 1MiB
	  is needed.

	  Asterisk function ast_pthread_create_background set stack size for new
	  thread to much smaller AST_BACKGROUND_STACKSIZE (~500KiB).

	  This results in Asterisk crash when running with Corosync 2.x.

	  Patch solves this issue by creating it's own version of
	  ast_pthread_create_background which sets stack size to much higher value
	  (actually it's AST_BACKGROUND_STACKSIZE + 3MiB).

	  Another problem may appear when "corosync show members" netconsole
	  command is executed. It is also executed in thread and also has only
	  500KiB stack size. Sadly it calls corosync_cfg_get_node_addrs which
	  again needs at least 1MiB stack.

	  Solution is to use HAVE_COROSYNC_CFG_STATE_TRACK as a discriminator
	  between Corosync 1.x and 2.x. If 1.x is found, nothing changes. If 2.x
	  is found, NodeID is displayed instead of IP address.

	  decline if it isn't.  The macro was then added to the mustache
	  template's "load_module" function.

	* bridge: Add a deferred queue.

	  This change adds a deferred queue to bridging. If a bridge
	  technology determines that a frame can not be written and
	  should be deferred it can indicate back to bridging to do so.
	  Bridging will then requeue any deferred frames upon a new
	  channel joining the bridge.

	  This change has been leveraged for T.38 request negotiate
	  control frames. Without the deferred queue there is a race
	  condition between the bridge receiving the T.38 request
	  negotiate and the second channel joining and being in the
	  bridge. If the channel is not yet in the bridge then the T.38
	  negotiation fails.

	  A unit test has also been added that confirms that a T.38
	  request negotiate control frame is deferred when no other
	  channel is in the bridge and that it is requeued when a new
	  channel joins the bridge.

	* res_pjsip_refer/session: Calls dropped during transfer

	  When doing an attended transfer it's possible for the transferer, after
	  receiving an accepted response from Asterisk, to send a BYE to Asterisk,
	  which can then be processed before Asterisk has time to start and/or
	  complete the transfer process. This of course causes the transfer to not
	  complete successfully, thus dropping the call.

	  This patch makes it so any BYEs received from the transferer, after the REFER,
	  that initiate a session end are deferred until the transfer is complete. This
	  allows the channel that would have otherwise been hung up by Asterisk to
	  remain available throughout the transfer process.

	* chan_pjsip: Update device state when in early media.

	  The chan_pjsip module uses a calculation approach for
	  determining device state. This means that in situations
	  where we would expect device state to change we need to
	  tell the core to query. A scenario that was missed is
	  when early media was signaled.

	  This change adds the notification for the core to
	  query device state when we are told that early media
	  is being provided.

	* pjsip: Extend 'asymmetric_rtp_codec' option to include us changing.

	  PJSIP support in Asterisk differs from chan_sip in that it
	  allows media to be sent as-is without transcoding provided
	  the codecs were negotiated in the SDP. This is allowed
	  according to the RFC. Support for this differs quite a lot
	  though and some endpoints do not handle it well.

	  This change extends the 'asymmetric_rtp_codec' option to
	  also cover this case. When set to no (the default) the code
	  behaves as chan_sip does - the best codec is selected and
	  we will only ever send that, unless we change what we are
	  sending if the remote side changes. When set to yes we
	  will send media as-is without transcoding if the codec
	  has been negotiated in the SDP.

	  When a frame destined for a MulticastRTP channel does not have timing
	  information (such as when an 'originate' is done), we generate the RTP
	  timestamps ourselves without regard to the number of samples we are
	  about to send.

	  Instead, use the same method as res_rtp_asterisk and 'predict' a
	  timestamp given the number of samples. If the difference between the
	  timestamp that we generate and the one we predict is within a specific
	  threshold, use the predicted timestamp so that we end up with timestamps
	  that are consistent with the number of samples we are actually sending.

	* channel: ast_write frame wrongly freed after call to audiohooks

	  ASTERISK-26419 introduced a bug when calling ast_audiohook_write_list in
	  ast_write. It would free the frame given to ast_write if the frame returned
	  by ast_audiohook_write_list was different than the given one. The frame give
	  to ast_write should never be freed within that function. It is the caller's
	  resposibility to free the frame after writing (or when it its done with it).
	  By freeing it within ast_write this of course led to some memory corruption
	  problems.

	  This patch makes it so the frame given to ast_write is no longer freed within
	  the function. The frame returned by ast_audiohook_write_list is now subsequently
	  used in ast_write and is freed later. It is freed either after translate if the
	  frame returned by translate is different, or near the end of ast_write prior to
	  function exit.

	  In review 4843 (ASTERISK-24858), we added a hack that forced a smoother

	  smoother flags so that formats can dictate their own options.

	  A previous commit added plumbing to bridge_softmix to allow for an SFU
	  experience with Asterisk. This commit adds an option to app_confbridge
	  that allows for a confbridge to actually make use of the SFU video mode.

	  SFU mode is implemented in a "set it and forget it" kind of way. That
	  is, when the bridge is created, if SFU mode is enabled, then the video
	  mode gets set to SFU and cannot be changed. Future improvements may
	  allow for a hybrid experience (e.g. forward multiple video streams,
	  specifically those of the most recent talkers), but for this addition,
	  no such capability is present.

	* Add primitive SFU support to bridge_softmix.

	  This sets up the "plumbing" in bridge_softmix to
	  be able to accommodate Asterisk asking as an SFU
	  (selective forwarding unit) for conferences.

	  The way this works is that whenever a channel enters or leaves a
	  conference, all participants in the bridge get sent a stream topology
	  change request. The topologies consist of the channels' original
	  topology, along with video destination streams corresponding to each
	  participants' source video streams. So for instance, if Alice, Bob, and
	  Carol are in the conference, and each supplies one video stream, then
	  the topologies for each would look like so:

	  Alice:
	  Audio,
	  Source video(Alice),
	  Destination Video(Bob),
	  Destination video (Carol)

	  Bob:
	  Audio,
	  Source video(Bob)
	  Destination Video(Alice),
	  Destination video (Carol)

	  Carol:
	  Audio,
	  Source video(Carol)
	  Destination Video(Alice),
	  Destination video (Bob)

	  This way, video that arrives from a source video stream can then be
	  copied out to the destination video streams on the other participants'
	  channels.

	  Once the bridge gets told that a topology on a channel has changed, the
	  bridge constructs a map in order to get the video frames routed to the
	  proper destination streams. This is done using the bridge channel's
	  stream_map.

	  This change is bare-bones with regards to SFU support. Some key features
	  are missing at this point:

	  * Stream limits. This commit makes no effort to limit the number of
	    streams on a specific channel. This means that if there were 50 video
	    callers in a conference, bridge_softmix will happily send out topology
	    change requests to every channel in the bridge, requesting 50+
	    streams.

	  * Configuration. The plumbing has been added to bridge_softmix, but
	    there has been nothing added as of yet to app_confbridge to enable SFU
	    video mode.

	  * Testing. Some functions included here have unit tests.
	    However, the functionality as a whole has only been verified by
	    hand-tracing the code.

	  * Selectivenss. For a "selective" forwarding unit, this does not
	    currently have any means of being selective.

	  * Features. Presumably, someone might wish to only receive video from
	    specific sources. There are no external-facing functions at the moment
	    that allow for users to select who they receive video from.

	  * Efficiency. The current scheme treats all video streams as being
	    unidirectional. We could be re-using a source video stream as a
	    desetnation, too. But to simplify things on this first round, I did it
	    this way.

	* app_queue: Fix members showing as being in call when not.

	  A change was done which added an 'in_call' flag to queue
	  members that was set to true while talking to an agent.
	  Unfortunately in practice this does not accurately reflect
	  whether they are talking to an agent or not. If a Local
	  channel is involved and a transfer is performed then the
	  app_queue application would incorrectly think the agent
	  was still in a call with the caller. This was done to
	  fix a race condition between an agent becoming available
	  by device state and the checking of the last call information
	  for the wrapup time. There was a small window where the
	  last call information would be the previous value instead
	  of the new one.

	  This change goes about fixing the original issue in a
	  different way by considering the call completed if device
	  state is received which would make the agent available
	  and if they are currently in a call. If this occurs the
	  last call information is updated before the agent becomes
	  available ensuring that old information is not present
	  when checking if the member should be called. This also
	  improves the transfer situation by actually updating
	  and enforcing the wrapup time.

	  also cloned into it. Any additional streams from the original topology matching
	  the "type" are subsequently ignored (i.e. not added to the new topology).

	  For this same case when a frame is read from a stream that frame is still
	  echoed back like before, but now that frame is also echoed out to the
	  additional streams that matched on the specified "type".

	* core/conversions: Added string to unsigned integer and long conversions

	  Added functions that convert a string to an unsigned integer or unsigned long.
	  A couple of unit test were also created to test the routines. The reasons for
	  adding these conversion utilities (and hopefully eventually more) are as
	  follows:

	    * Conversion routines are functionally contained with consistent and
	      better error checking
	    * The function names offer a better description of what is happening
	    * It encourages code reuse for easier bug fixing at a single source
	    * It's simpler to use
	    * It's unit testable

	  For instance, currently in a lot of places when converting to an integer or
	  similar the "sscanf" function is used. When using "sscanf" it may not be
	  immediately clear what's happening as it lacks semantic naming. Limited error
	  checking is usually done as well. For example, most of the time a check is done
	  to make sure the value converted, but does not check for overflows or negative
	  valued conversions when converting unsigned numbers.

	  Why use/wrap "strtoul" and not "sscanf" then? Primarily, it lacks some of the
	  built in error handling that "strtoul" has. For instance "strtoul" contains
	  overflow checks. Less so, but can still factor as reasons, "sscanf" is slightly
	  more complex in its use. And maybe a bit controversial, but it may be ("big if")
	  potentially slower than "strtoul" in some cases.

	* res_pjsip_session.c: Process initial INVITE sooner. (key exists)

	  Retransmissions of an initial INVITE could be queued in the serializer
	  before we have processed the first INVITE message.  If the first INVITE
	  message doesn't get completely processed before the retransmissions are
	  seen then we could try to setup the same call from the retransmissions.  A
	  symptom of this is seeing a (key exists) message associated with an
	  INVITE.  An earlier change attempted to address this kind of problem by
	  calculating a distributor serializer to use for unassociated messages.
	  Part of that change also made incoming calls keep using that distributor
	  serializer.  (ASTERISK-26088) However, some leftover code was still
	  deferring the INVITE processing to the session's serializer even though we
	  were already in that serializer.  This not only is unnecessary but would
	  cause the same call resetup problem.

	  * Removed the code to defer processing the initial INVITE to the session's
	  serializer because we are already running in that serializer.

	* app_queue: Fix duplicate queue_log entries for EXITEMPTY and ABANDON

	  There are 2 places in app_queue.c that log EXITEMPTY event: one in
	  wait_our_turn, and another one in queue_exec in the loop trying to
	  call an agent after wait_our_turn.

	  In most cases it leads to logging EXITEMPTY twice.

	  ABANDON is also logged on two places, and in the rare case when an agent
	  and caller hang up simultaneously it's also possible to get duplicates
	  in queue_log.

	  This commit changes wait_our_turn to return -1 ("the caller should exit
	  the queue") instead of 0 ("the caller's turn has arrived") in case of
	  leaving when empty, so queue_exec skips the agent calling loop.

	  Also, leave_queue is now executed only once in this case, because 2nd
	  time is just a noop when the queue entry has already been removed.

	  Also, it sets qe->handled to -1 to indicate that the call was not
	  answered by an agent, but the necessary handling has already been done
	  in order to avoid logging an extra ABANDON entry.

	* cel_odbc:  Fix timestamp processing for microseconds

	  When a column is of type timestamp, the fraction part of the event
	  field's seconds was frequently parsed incorrectly especially if
	  there were leading zeros.  For instance "2017-05-23 23:55:03.023"
	  would be parsed into an int as "23" then when the timestamp was
	  formatted again to be inserted into the database column it'd be
	  "2017-05-23 23:55:03.23" which is now 230 milliseconds instead of
	  23 milliseconds.  "03.000001" would be transformed to "03.1", etc.

	  * If the event field is 'eventtime' and the db column is timestamp,
	    then existing processing has already correctly formatted the
	    timestamp so now we simply use it rather than parsing it and
	    re-printing it. This is the most common use case anyway.

	  * If the event field is other than 'eventtime' and the db column
	    is timestamp, we now parse the seconds, including the fractional
	    part into a double rather than 2 ints.  This preserves the
	    magnitude and precision of the fractional part.  When we print
	    it, we now print it as a "%09.6lf" which correctly represents the
	    input.

	  To be honest, why we parse the string timestamp into components,
	  test the components, then print the components back into a string
	  timestamp is beyond me.  We should use parse it, test it, then if
	  it passes, use the original string representation in the database
	  call.  Maybe someone thought that some implementations wouldn't
	  take a partial timestamp string like "2017-05-06" and decided to
	  always produce a full timestamp string even if an abbreviated one
	  was supplied.  Anyway, I'm leaving it as it is.

	* logger:  Added logger_queue_limit to the configuration options.

	  All log messages go to a queue serviced by a single thread
	  which does all the IO.  This setting controls how big that
	  queue can get (and therefore how much memory is allocated)
	  before new messages are discarded. The default is 1000.
	  Should something go bezerk and log tons of messages in a tight
	  loop, this will prevent memory escalation.

	  When the limit is reached, a WARNING is logged to that effect
	  and messages are discarded until the queue is empty again.  At
	  that time another WARNING will be logged with the count of
	  discarded messages.  There's no "low water mark" for this queue
	  because the logger thread empties the entire queue and processes it
	  in 1 batch before going back and waiting on the queue again.
	  Implementing a low water mark would mean additional locking as
	  the thread processes each message and it's not worth it.

	  A "test" was added to test_logger.c but since the outcome is
	  non-deterministic, it's really just a cli command, not a unit
	  test.

	  When using the Bridge AMI action on the same channel multiple times

	  should next be executed in the dialplan, not where it may or may not

	* bridge_simple: Added support for streams

	  This patch is the first cut at adding stream support to the bridging framework.
	  Changes were made to the framework that allows mapping of stream topologies to
	  a bridge's supported media types.

	  The first channel to enter a bridge initially defines the media types for a
	  bridge (i.e. a one to one mapping is created between the bridge and the first
	  channel). Subsequently added channels merge their media types into the bridge's
	  adding to it when necessary. This allows channels with different sized
	  topologies to map correctly to each other according to media type. The bridge
	  drops any frame that does not have a matching index into a given write stream.

	  For now though, bridge_simple will align its two channels according to size or
	  first to join. Once both channels join the bridge the one with the most streams
	  will indicate to the other channel to update its streams to be the same as that
	  of the other. If both channels have the same number of streams then the first
	  channel to join is chosen as the stream base.

	  A topology change source was also added to a channel when a stream toplogy
	  change request is made. This allows subsystems to know whether or not they
	  initiated a change request. Thus avoiding potential recursive situations.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Clearing the remote RTCP address causes RTCP failures

	  When a call gets put on hold RTP is temporarily stopped and Asterisk was

	* SDP API: Add SSRC-level attributes

	  RFC 5576 defines how SSRC-level attributes may be added to SDP media
	  descriptions. In general, this is useful for grouping related SSRCes,
	  indicating SSRC-level format attributes, and resolving collisions in RTP
	  SSRC values. These attributes are used widely by browsers during WebRTC
	  communications, including attributes defined by documents outside of RFC
	  5576.

	  This commit introduces the addition of SSRC-level attributes into SDPs
	  generated by Asterisk. Since Asterisk does not tend to use multiple
	  SSRCs on a media stream, the initial support is minimal. Asterisk
	  includes an SSRC-level CNAME attribute if configured to do so. This at
	  least gives browsers (and possibly others) the ability to resolve SSRC
	  collisions at offer-answer time.

	  In order to facilitate this, the RTP engine API has been enhanced to be
	  able to retrieve the SSRC and CNAME on a given RTP instance.

	  res_rtp_asterisk currently does not provide meaningful CNAME values in
	  its RTCP SDES items, and therefore it currently will always return an
	  empty string as the CNAME value. A task in the near future will result
	  in res_rtp_asterisk generating more meaningful CNAMEs.

	* res_pjsip_session:  Add cleanup to ast_sip_session_terminate

	  If you use ast_request to create a PJSIP channel but then hang it
	  up without causing a transaction to be sent, the session will
	  never be destroyed.  This is due ot the fact that it's pjproject
	  that triggers the session cleanup when the transaction ends.
	  app_chanisavail was doing this to get more granular channel state
	  and it's also possible for this to happen via ARI.

	  * ast_sip_session_terminate was modified to explicitly call the
	    cleanup tasks and unreference session if the invite state is NULL
	    AND invite_tsx is NULL (meaning we never sent a transaction).

	  * chan_pjsip/hangup was modified to bump session before it calls
	    ast_sip_session_terminate to insure that session stays valid
	    while it does its own cleanup.

	  * Added test events to session_destructor for a future testsuite
	    test.

	  This change extends the ast_request functionality by adding another

	* frame: Better handle interpolated frames.

	  Interpolated frames are frames which contain a number of
	  samples but have no actual data. Audiohooks did not
	  handle this case when translating an incoming frame into
	  signed linear. It assumed that a frame would always contain
	  media when it may not. If this occurs audiohooks will now
	  immediately return and not act on the frame.

	  As well for users of ast_trans_frameout the function has
	  been changed to be a bit more sane and ensure that the data
	  pointer on a frame is set to NULL if no data is actually
	  on the frame. This allows the various spots in Asterisk that
	  check for an interpolated frame based on the presence of a
	  data pointer to work as expected.

	* SDP: Ensure SDPs "merge" properly.

	  The gist of this work ensures that when a remote SDP is received, it is
	  merged properly with the local capabilities. The remote SDP is converted
	  into a stream topology. That topology is then merged with the current
	  local topology on the SDP state. That new merged topology is then used
	  to create an SDP. Finally, adjustments are made to RTP instances based
	  on knowledge gained from the remote SDP.

	  There are also a battery of tests in this commit that ensure that some
	  basic SDP merges work as expected.

	  While this may not sound like a big change, it has the property that it
	  caused lots of ancillary changes.

	  * The remote SDP is no longer stored on the SDP state. Biggest reason:
	    there's no need for it. The remote SDP is used at the time it is being
	    set and nowhere else.

	  * Some new SDP APIs were added in order to find attributes and convert
	    generic SDP attributes into rtpmap structures.

	  * Writing tests made me realize that retrieving a value from an SDP
	    options structure, the SDP options needs to be made const.

	  * The SDP state machine was essentially gutted by a previous commit.
	    Initially, I attempted to reinstate it, but I found that as it had
	    been defined, it was not all that useful. What was more useful was
	    knowing the role we play in SDP negotiation, so the SDP state machine
	    has been transformed into an indicator of role.

	  * Rather than storing separate local and joint stream state
	    capabilities, it makes more sense to keep track of current stream
	    state and update it as things change.

	* core: Use eventfd for alert pipes on Linux when possible

	  The primary win of switching to eventfd when possible is that it only
	  uses a single file descriptor while pipe() will use two. This means for
	  each bridge channel we're reducing the number of required file
	  descriptors by 1, and - if you're using timerfd - we also now have 1
	  less file descriptor per Asterisk channel.

	  The API is not ideal (passing int arrays), but this is the cleanest
	  approach I could come up with to maintain API/ABI.

	  I've also removed what I believe to be an erroneous code block that
	  checked the non-blocking flag on the pipe ends for each read. If the
	  file descriptor is 'losing' its non-blocking mode, it is because of a
	  bug somewhere else in our code.

	  In my testing I haven't seen any measurable difference in performance.

	* rtp_engine/res_rtp_asterisk: Fix RTP struct reentrancy crashes.

	  The struct ast_rtp_instance has historically been indirectly protected
	  from reentrancy issues by the channel lock because early channel drivers
	  held the lock for really long times.  Holding the channel lock for such a
	  long time has caused many deadlock problems in the past.  Along comes
	  chan_pjsip/res_pjsip which doesn't necessarily hold the channel lock
	  because sometimes there may not be an associated channel created yet or
	  the channel pointer isn't available.

	  In the case of ASTERISK-26835 a pjsip serializer thread was processing a
	  message's SDP body while another thread was reading a RTP packet from the
	  socket.  Both threads wound up changing the rtp->rtcp->local_addr_str
	  string and interfering with each other.  The classic reentrancy problem
	  resulted in a crash.

	  In the case of ASTERISK-26853 a pjsip serializer thread was processing a
	  message's SDP body while another thread was reading a RTP packet from the
	  socket.  Both threads wound up processing ICE candidates in PJPROJECT and
	  interfering with each other.  The classic reentrancy problem resulted in a
	  crash.

	  * rtp_engine.c: Make the ast_rtp_instance_xxx() calls lock the RTP
	  instance struct.

	  * rtp_engine.c: Make ICE and DTLS wrapper functions to lock the RTP

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Lock the RTP instance to prevent a reentrancy
	  problem with rtp->rtcp->local_addr_str in the scheduler thread running
	  ast_rtcp_write().

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Avoid deadlock when local RTP bridging in
	  bridge_p2p_rtp_write() because there are two RTP instance structs
	  involved.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Avoid deadlock when trying to stop scheduler
	  callbacks.  We cannot hold the instance lock when trying to stop a
	  scheduler callback.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Remove the lock in struct dtls_details and use the
	  struct ast_rtp_instance ao2 object lock instead.  The lock was used to
	  synchronize two threads to prevent a race condition between starting and
	  stopping a timeout timer.  The race condition is no longer present between
	  dtls_perform_handshake() and __rtp_recvfrom() because the instance lock
	  prevents these functions from overlapping each other with regards to the
	  timeout timer.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Remove the lock in struct ast_rtp and use the struct
	  ast_rtp_instance ao2 object lock instead.  The lock was used to
	  synchronize two threads using a condition signal to know when TURN
	  negotiations complete.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Avoid deadlock when trying to stop the TURN
	  ioqueue_worker_thread().  We cannot hold the instance lock when trying to
	  create or shut down the worker thread without a risk of deadlock.

	  This patch exposed a race condition between a PJSIP serializer thread
	  setting up an ICE session in ice_create() and another thread reading RTP
	  packets.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c:ice_create(): Set the new rtp->ice pointer after we
	  have re-locked the RTP instance to prevent the other thread from trying to
	  process ICE packets on an incomplete ICE session setup.

	  A similar race condition is between a PJSIP serializer thread resetting up
	  an ICE session in ice_create() and the timer_worker_thread() processing
	  the completion of the previous ICE session.

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c:ast_rtp_on_ice_complete(): Protect against an
	  uninitialized/null remote_address after calling
	  update_address_with_ice_candidate().

	  * res_rtp_asterisk.c: Eliminate the chance of ice_reset_session()
	  destroying and setting the rtp->ice pointer to NULL while other threads
	  are using it by adding an ao2 wrapper around the PJPROJECT ice pointer.
	  Now when we have to unlock the RTP instance object to call a PJPROJECT ICE
	  function we will hold a ref to the wrapper.  Also added some rtp->ice NULL
	  checks after we relock the RTP instance and have to do something with the
	  ICE structure.

	* modules:  change module LOAD_FAILUREs to LOAD_DECLINES

	  In all non-pbx modules, AST_MODULE_LOAD_FAILURE has been changed
	  to AST_MODULE_LOAD_DECLINE.  This prevents asterisk from exiting
	  if a module can't be loaded.  If the user wishes to retain the
	  FAILURE behavior for a specific module, they can use the "require"
	  or "preload-require" keyword in modules.conf.

	  A new API was added to logger: ast_is_logger_initialized().  This
	  allows asterisk.c/check_init() to print to the error log once the
	  logger subsystem is ready instead of just to stdout.  If something
	  does fail before the logger is initialized, we now print to stderr
	  instead of stdout.

	* channel: Remove old epoll support and fixed max number of file descriptors.

	  This change removes the old epoll support which has not been used or
	  maintained in quite some time.

	  The fixed number of file descriptors on a channel has also been removed.
	  File descriptors are now contained in a growable vector. This can be
	  used like before by specifying a specific position to store a file
	  descriptor at or using a new API call, ast_channel_fd_add, which adds
	  a file descriptor to the channel and returns its position.

	  Tests have been added which cover the growing behavior of the vector
	  and the new API call.

	* pjproject_bundled: raise timeout value used when downloading

	  After configuring Asterisk with '--with-pjproject-bundled' the configure/build
	  process attempts to download pjproject from its download site. Currently, a
	  timeout of 10 seconds is used that will stop the download process if pjproject
	  has not been fully downloaded in that time. For some systems this was not enough
	  time and the process was timing out too early.

	  This patch raises the download timeout value to '60'. Also, this patch fixes
	  another bug where the DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT variable was not being properly exported
	  due to a naming error. DOWNLOAD_MAX_TIMEOUT is now properly renamed to
	  DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT.

	* res_xmpp: Correct implementation of JABBER_STATUS & JabberStatus

	  The documentation for JABBER_STATUS (and the deprecated JabberStatus
	  app) indicate that a return value of 7 indicates that the specified
	  buddy was not in the roster. It also indicates that you can specify a
	  "bare" JID (one without a resource). Unfortunately the actual behavior
	  does not match the documented behavior.

	  Assuming that our roster includes the buddy online and available
	  "valid@example.org/Valid" and does *not* include the buddy
	  "invalid@example.org", the JABBER_STATUS() function returns the
	  following before this patch:

	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | Buddy                        | Status     | Result                   |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | valid@example.org            |  Online    |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  | valid@example.org/Valid      |  Online    |  1 (Online)              |
	  | valid@example.org/Invalid    |  N/A       |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  | invalid@example.org          |  N/A       |  Error logged, no return |
	  | invalid@example.org/Valid    |  N/A       |  Error logged, no return |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+

	  And after this patch:

	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | Buddy                        | Status     | Result                   |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+
	  | valid@example.org            |  Online    |  1 (Online)              |
	  | valid@example.org/Valid      |  Online    |  1 (Online)              |
	  | valid@example.org/Invalid    |  N/A       |  6 (Offline)             |
	  | invalid@example.org          |  N/A       |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  | invalid@example.org/Valid    |  N/A       |  7 (Not in roster)       |
	  +------------------------------+------------+--------------------------+

	  This brings the behavior in line with the documentation.

	* rtp_engine: allocate RTP dynamic payloads per session

	  Dynamic payload types were statically defined in Asterisk. This unfortunately
	  limited the number of dynamic payloads that could be registered. With this patch
	  dynamic payload type numbers are now assigned dynamically and per RTP instance.
	  However, in order to limit any issues where some clients expect the old
	  statically defined value this patch makes it so the value Asterisk used to pre-
	  designate is used for the dynamic assignment if available.

	  An option, "rtp_use_dynamic", has also been added (can be set in asterisk.conf)
	  that turns the new dynamic behavior on or off. When off it reverts back to using
	  statically defined payload values. This option defaults to "yes" in Asterisk 15.

	* res_pjsip:  Symmetric transports

	  A new transport parameter 'symmetric_transport' has been added.

	  When a request from a dynamic contact comes in on a transport with
	  this option set to 'yes', the transport name will be saved and used
	  for subsequent outgoing requests like OPTIONS, NOTIFY and INVITE.
	  It's saved as a contact uri parameter named 'x-ast-txp' and will
	  display with the contact uri in CLI, AMI, and ARI output.  On the
	  outgoing request, if a transport wasn't explicitly set on the
	  endpoint AND the request URI is not a hostname, the saved transport
	  will be used and the 'x-ast-txp' parameter stripped from the
	  outgoing packet.

	  * config_transport was modified to accept and store the new parameter.

	  * config_transport/transport_apply was updated to store the transport
	    name in the pjsip_transport->info field using the pjsip_transport->pool
	    on UDP transports.

	  * A 'multihomed_on_rx_message' function was added to
	    pjsip_message_ip_updater that, for incoming requests, retrieves the
	    transport name from pjsip_transport->info and retrieves the transport.
	    If transport->symmetric_transport is set, an 'x-ast-txp' uri parameter
	    containing the transport name is added to the incoming Contact header.

	  * An 'ast_sip_get_transport_name' function was added to res_pjsip.
	    It takes an ast_sip_endpoint and a pjsip_sip_uri and returns a
	    transport name if endpoint->transport is set or if there's an
	    'x-ast-txp' parameter on the uri and the uri host is an ipv4 or
	    ipv6 address.  Otherwise it returns NULL.

	  * An 'ast_sip_dlg_set_transport' function was added to res_pjsip
	    which takes an ast_sip_endpoint, a pjsip_dialog, and an optional
	    pjsip_tpselector.  It calls ast_sip_get_transport_name() and if
	    a non-NULL is returned, sets the selector and sets the transport
	    on the dialog.  If a selector was passed in, it's updated.

	  * res_pjsip/ast_sip_create_dialog_uac and ast_sip_create_dialog_uas
	    were modified to call ast_sip_dlg_set_transport() instead of their
	    original logic.

	  * res_pjsip/create_out_of_dialog_request was modified to call
	    ast_sip_get_transport_name() and pjsip_tx_data_set_transport()
	    instead of its original logic.

	  * Existing transport logic was removed from endpt_send_request
	    since that can only be called after a create_out_of_dialog_request.

	  * res_pjsip/ast_sip_create_rdata was converted to a wrapper around
	    a new 'ast_sip_create_rdata_with_contact' function which allows
	    a contact_uri to be specified in addition to the existing
	    parameters.  (See below)

	  * res_pjsip_pubsub/internal_pjsip_evsub_send_request was eliminated
	    since all it did was transport selection and that is now done in
	    ast_sip_create_dialog_uac and ast_sip_create_dialog_uas.

	  * 'contact_uri' was added to subscription_persistence.  This was
	    necessary because although the parsed rdata contact header has the
	    x-ast-txp parameter added (if appropriate),
	    subscription_persistence_update stores the raw packet which
	    doesn't have it.  subscription_persistence_recreate was then
	    updated to call ast_sip_create_rdata_with_contact with the
	    persisted contact_uri so the recreated subscription has the
	    correct transport info to send the NOTIFYs.

	  * res_pjsip_session/internal_pjsip_inv_send_msg was eliminated since
	    all it did was transport selection and that is now done in
	    ast_sip_create_dialog_uac.

	  * pjsip_message_ip_updater/multihomed_on_tx_message was updated
	    to remove all traces of the x-ast-txp parameter from the
	    outgoing headers.

	  NOTE:  This change does NOT modify the behavior of permanent
	  contacts specified on an aor.  To do so would require that the
	  permanent contact's contact uri be updated with the x-ast-txp
	  parameter and the aor sorcery object updated.  If we need to
	  persue this, we need to think about cloning permanent contacts into
	  the same store as the dynamic ones on an aor load so they can be
	  updated without disturbing the originally configured value.

	  You CAN add the x-ast-txp parameter to a permanent contact's uri
	  but it would be much simpler to just set endpoint->transport.

	* autochan/mixmonitor/chanspy: Fix unsafe channel locking and references.

	  Dereferencing struct ast_autochan.chan without first calling
	  ast_autochan_channel_lock() is unsafe because the pointer could change at
	  any time due to a masquerade.  Unfortunately, ast_autochan_channel_lock()
	  itself uses struct ast_autochan.chan unsafely and can result in a deadlock
	  if the original channel happens to get destroyed after a masquerade in
	  addition to the pointer getting changed.

	  The problem is more likely to happen with v11 and earlier because
	  masquerades are used to optimize out local channels on those versions.
	  However, it could still happen on newer versions if the channel is
	  executing a dialplan application when the channel is transferred or
	  redirected.  In this situation a masquerade still must be used.

	  * Added a lock to struct ast_autochan to safely be able to use
	  ast_autochan.chan while trying to get the channel lock in
	  ast_autochan_channel_lock().  The locking order is the channel lock then
	  the autochan lock.  Locking in the other direction requires deadlock
	  avoidance.

	  * Fix unsafe ast_autochan.chan usages in app_mixmonitor.c.

	* Add rtcp-mux support

	  This commit adds support for RFC 5761: Multiplexing RTP Data and Control
	  Packets on a Single Port. Specifically, it enables the feature when
	  using chan_pjsip.

	  A new option, "rtcp_mux" has been added to endpoint configuration in
	  pjsip.conf. If set, then Asterisk will attempt to use rtcp-mux with
	  whatever it communicates with. Asterisk follows the rules set forth in
	  RFC 5761 with regards to falling back to standard RTCP behavior if the
	  far end does not indicate support for rtcp-mux.

	  The lion's share of the changes in this commit are in
	  res_rtp_asterisk.c. This is because it was pretty much hard wired to
	  have an RTP and an RTCP transport. The strategy used here is that when
	  rtcp-mux is enabled, the current RTCP transport and its trappings (such
	  as DTLS SSL session) are freed, and the RTCP session instead just
	  mooches off the RTP session. This leads to a lot of specialized if
	  statements throughout.

	* app_queue: Handle the caller being redirected out of a queue bridge

	  A caller can leave the Queue() application after being bridged with a
	  member in a few ways:

	    * Caller or member hangup
	    * Caller is transferred somewhere else (blind or atx)
	    * Caller is externally redirected elsewhere

	  The first 2 scenarios are currently handled by subscribing to stasis
	  messages, but the 3rd is not explicitly covered. If a caller is
	  redirected away from the Queue() application, the member who was last
	  bridged with that caller will remain in an "In use" state until the
	  caller hangs up.

	  This patch adds handling of the caller leaving the queue via
	  redirection. We monitor the caller-member bridge, and if the caller is
	  the one that leaves, we treat it the same as we would a caller hangup.

	* pbx.c: Fix crash from malformed exten pattern.

	  Forgetting to indicate an exten is a pattern can cause a crash if the
	  "pattern" has a character set range.  e.g., "9999[3-5]" The crash is due
	  to a buffer overwrite because the '-' exten eye-candy wasn't removed as
	  expected and overran the allocated space.

	  The buffer overwrite is fixed two ways in this patch.

	  1) Fix ext_strncpy() to distinguish between pattern and non-pattern
	  extens.  Now '-' characters are removed when they are eye-candy and not
	  when they are part of a pattern character set.  Since the function is
	  private to pbx.c, the return value now returns the number of bytes written
	  to the destination buffer instead of the strlen() of the final buffer so
	  the callers that care don't need to add one.

	  2) Fix callers to ext_strncpy() to supply the correct available buffer
	  size of the destination buffer.

	* main/stasis_cache: Demote the ERROR message when removing a nonexistent item

	  This patch demotes the ERROR message that is displayed when a
	  nonexistent item is removed from the Stasis cache. The genesis of this
	  demotion is due to chan_sip's realtime peers and their interaction with
	  Asterisk's core ast_endpoint code, but ostensibly it could happen from
	  other channel drivers as well.

	  Since Mark Michelson already did an excellent job of explaining on this
	  issue, it is quoted here for posterity:

	  "Internally, when a realtime peer is retrieved, Asterisk creates an
	  ast_endpoint structure. When that peer is destroyed, the ast_endpoint is
	  destroyed as well. Part of the destruction of the ast_endpoint involves
	  clearing the Stasis cache of all information about that endpoint. The
	  problem here is that the act of creating the ast_endpoint is not enough
	  to actually put any information in the Stasis cache. Instead, something
	  has to happen, such as a state change, in order for the Stasis cache to
	  have any information about that endpoint. When a device registers,
	  chan_sip creates an ast_endpoint structure, processes the REGISTER, and
	  then destroys the ast_endpoint. When the ast_endpoint is destroyed,
	  there is nothing to destroy in the Stasis cache, so an error message is
	  emitted. When you use rtcachefriends, ast_endpoint structures persist
	  for the lifetime of the module and so you do not see this error
	  message."

	  2. Legacy behavior has been adopted in ast_read() such that if a

	  and the current stream topology is preserved if the application is
	  not capable of handling streams.

	  Tests have also been written which confirm the multistream and

	* stream: Unit tests for stream read and tweaks framework

	  * Removed the AST_CHAN_TP_MULTISTREAM tech property.  We now rely
	    on read_stream being set to indicate a multi stream channel.
	  * Added ast_channel_is_multistream convenience function.
	  * Fixed issue where stream and default_stream weren't being set on
	    a frame retrieved from the queue.
	  * Now testing for NULL being returned from the driver's read or
	    read_stream callback.
	  * Fixed issue where the dropnondefault code was crashing on a
	    NULL f.
	  * Now enforcing that if either read_stream or write_stream are
	    set when ast_channel_tech_set is called that BOTH are set.
	  * Added the unit tests.

	  not suspended when performing the native RTP bridging and this
	  requirement has been documented in the bridge technology.

	* build: Execute ldconfig to build cache. (take two)

	  On some platforms a multiarch approach is used for libraries.
	  The build system does not take this into account and still
	  places libraries into the lib directory if no --libdir is
	  specified to configure. On initial startup this results in
	  libasteriskssl.so not being found, as it is not in the multiarch
	  lib directory.  To make matters worse, options were being passed
	  to ldconfig on both Linux and FreeBSD that actually prevented
	  the rebuild of the cache.

	   * Fedora has a /usr/share/config.site that automatically tells
	     autoconf to use /usr/lib64 but CentOS does not. This logic was
	     copied to configure.ac and modified so systems like Ubuntu,
	     which still use /usr/lib for 64-bit systems, aren't affected.

	  Now that we have them in the correct directory...

	  In order for the system loader to find libasteriskssl and
	  libasteriskpj, one of 3 things has to happen...

	    - The linker cache must be rebuilt including the directory
	      where the libasterisk* libraries were installed.  Only root
	      can rebuild the cache.  This was busted.
	    - We have to link the asterisk binary with an rpath pointing
	      to the directrory where the libasterisk* libraries were
	      installed.  This makes things very complicated and will happen
	      over the collective dead bodies of everyone who's had to
	      package a distribution with an rpath.
	    - Finally, you can start asterisk with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the
	      directrory where the libasterisk* libraries were installed.

	  There are no other options. So...

	   * The invokation of ldconfig has been moved from main/Makefile
	     to ASTTOPDIR/Makefile, the options have been removed, and
	     DESTDIR/ASTLIBDIR appended.  If you aren't root, you will be
	     warned after the "Asterisk Installation Compete" banner that
	     you must re-run 'make install' as root, manually run
	     'ldconfig DESTDIR/ASTLIBDIR' as root, or run asterisk with
	     LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

	* build_tools:  Fix download_externals to allow the use of curl or wget

	  Not sure if this is really a bug versus an improvement. I can see it being

	  The current build_tools/download_externals file depends on wget in order to
	  download external modules.  The current build system is able to discover
	  which tool to use for fetching remote files - either wget or curl.

	  This patch takes advantage of this capability by modifying the two calls to
	  the wget binary to instead use what was discovered by the build system.

	  If DESTDIR is specified, however, the old logic is executed as
	  the install process may not have permission to alter the ldconfig

	* res_pjsip_authenticator_digest.c: Fix sorcery's immutable contract violation.

	  The inbound authentication object is supposed to be immutable when it is
	  stored in sorcery.  However, the immutable property is violated if the
	  authentication object does not have a realm set.

	  The immutable contract violation has a different effect depending upon
	  what sorcery back end is used.  If it is the config file back end you
	  would get the same object back until res_pjsip is reloaded.  If it is the
	  real-time or AstDB back end you would get a new object on each query.  If
	  it is cached you would get the same object back until it is refreshed from
	  the database.

	  Once an inbound authentication object has its realm set it may or may not
	  get updated again if the default_realm changes.

	  If the same authentication object is used for inbound and outbound
	  authentication then the immutable violation can make it very hard to
	  determine why the outbound authentication now fails.  The only diagnostic
	  message is a complaint about no realms matching when it had worked
	  earlier.  It fails because of the difference in behaviour for an empty
	  realm setting between inbound and outbound authentication objects.

	  * Fixed the sorcery object immutable violation by creating a new object
	  and setting the default_realm on it instead.  The new object is a shallow
	  copy for speed.

	  * The auth_store thread storage no longer holds an auth ref.  It
	  interferes with the shallow copy and never needed a ref anyway.

	  It helps if the logs referencing a tdata object buffer actually have a
	  name that includes the correct pointer as part of the name.  Also since
	  the tdata has its own pool it helps if any logs referencing the pool have
	  the same name as the tdata object.  This change brings tdata logging in
	  line with how tsx objects are named.

	* Remove extra ast_iostream_close() calls.

	  When AMI encounters an error at the beginning of a session, it would
	  explicitly call ast_iostream_close() on its tcptls session's iostream.
	  It then would jump to a label where it would shut down the tcptls
	  session instance. The tcptls session instance would again attempt to
	  close the iostream.

	  Under normal circumstances, this might go by unnoticed. However, when
	  MALLOC_DEBUG is enabled, all fields on the iostream get set to
	  0xdeaddead when the iostream is freed. Thus a second call to
	  ast_iostream_close() after the iostream has been freed would reslt in an
	  attempt to call SSL_shutdown on 0xdeaddead, which would crash and burn
	  horribly.

	  The fix here is to not directly close the iostream from the dangerous
	  scenarios. The specific scenarios are:
	  * Exceeding the configured authlimit
	  * Failing to build a mansession on a new connection

	* realtime: Fix LIKE escaping in SQL backends

	  The realtime framework allows for components to look up values using a
	  LIKE clause with similar syntax to SQL's. pbx_realtime uses this
	  functionality to search for pattern matching extensions that start with
	  an underscore (_).

	  When passing an underscore to SQL's LIKE clause, it will be interpreted
	  as a wildcard matching a single character and therefore needs to be
	  escaped. It is (for better or for worse) the responsibility of the
	  component that is querying realtime to escape it with a backslash before
	  passing it in. Some RDBMs support escape characters by default, but the
	  SQL92 standard explicitly says that there are no escape characters
	  unless they are specified with an ESCAPE clause, e.g.

	  	SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '\_%' ESCAPE '\'

	  This patch instructs 3 backends - res_config_mysql, res_config_pgsql,
	  and res_config_sqlite3 - to use the ESCAPE clause where appropriate.

	  Looking through documentation and source tarballs, I was able to
	  determine that the ESCAPE clause is supported in:

	  MySQL 5.0.15   (released 2005-10-22 - earliest version available from
	                  archives)
	  PostgreSQL 7.1 (released 2001-04-13)
	  SQLite 3.1.0   (released 2005-01-21)

	  The versions of the relevant libraries that we depend on to access MySQL
	  and PostgreSQL will not work on versions that old, and I've added an
	  explicit check in res_config_sqlite3 to only use the ESCAPE clause when
	  we have a sufficiently new version of SQLite3.

	  res_config_odbc already handles the escape characters appropriately, so
	  no changes were required there.

	* res_config_sqlite3: Properly create missing columns when necessary

	  There were two specific issues resolved here:

	  1) The code that iterated over the required fields
	     (via ast_realtime_require) was broken for the RQ_INTEGER1 field
	     type. Iteration would stop when the first RQ_INTEGER1 (0) field
	     was encountered.

	  2) sqlite3_changes() was used to try and count the number of rows
	     returned by a SELECT statement. sqlite3_changes() only counts
	     affected rows, so this was always returning the value from the
	     most recent data modification statement. We now separate read-only
	     queries from data modification queries and count rows appropriately
	     in both cases.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub:  Correctly implement persisted subscriptions

	  This patch fixes 2 original issues and more that those 2 exposed.

	  * When we send a NOTIFY, and the client either doesn't respond or
	    responds with a non OK, pjproject only calls our
	    pubsub_on_evsub_state callback, no others.  Since
	    pubsub_on_evsub_state (which does the sub_tree cleanup) does not
	    expect to be called back without the other callbacks being called
	    first, it just returns leaving the sub_tree orphaned.  Now
	    pubsub_on_evsub_state checks the event for PJSIP_EVENT_TSX_STATE
	    which is what pjproject will set to tell us that it was the
	    transaction that timed out or failed and not the subscription
	    itself timing our or being terminated by the client. If is
	    TSX_STATE, pubsub_on_evsub_state now does the proper cleanup
	    regardless of the state of the subscription.

	  * When a client renews a subscription, we don't update the
	    persisted subscription with the new expires timestamp.  This causes
	    subscription_persistence_recreate to prune the subscription if/when
	    asterisk restarts.  Now, pubsub_on_rx_refresh calls
	    subscription_persistence_update to apply the new expires timestamp.
	    This exposed other issues however...

	  * When creating a dialog from rdata (which sub_persistence_recreate
	    does from the packet buffer) there must NOT be a tag on the To
	    header (which there will be when a client refreshes a
	    subscription).  If there is one, pjsip_dlg_create_uas will fail.
	    To address this, subscription_persistence_update now accepts a flag
	    that indicates that the original packet buffer must not be updated.
	    New subscribes don't set the flag and renews do.  This makes sure
	    that when the rdata is recreated on asterisk startup, it's done
	    from the original subscribe packet which won't have the tag on To.

	  * When creating a dialog from rdata, we were setting the dialog's
	    remote (SUBSCRIBE) cseq to be the same as the local (NOTIFY) cseq.
	    When the client tried to resubscribe after a restart with the
	    correct cseq, we'd reject the request with an Invalid CSeq error.

	  * The acts of creating a dialog and evsub by themselves when
	    recreating a subscription does NOT restart pjproject's subscription
	    timer.  The result was that even if we did correctly recreate the
	    subscription, we never removed it if the client happened to go away
	    or send a non-OK response to a NOTIFY.  However, there is no
	    pjproject function exposed to just set the timer on an evsub that
	    wasn't created by an incoming subscribe request.  To address this,
	    we create our own timer using ast_sip_schedule_task.  This timer is
	    used only for re-establishing subscriptions after a restart.

	    An earlier approach was to add support for setting pjproject's
	    timer (via a pjproject patch) and while that patch is still included
	    here, we don't use that call at the moment.

	  While addressing these issues, additional debugging was added and
	  some existing messages made more useful.  A few formatting changes
	  were also made to 'pjsip show scheduled tasks' to make displaying
	  the subscription timers a little more friendly.

	  When PJSIP tries to call an endpoint with a domain (e.g. 1000@test.com),
	  the user part is stripped down as it would be a trunk with a specified user,
	  and only the host part is called as a PJSIP endpoint and can't be found.
	  This is not correct in the case of a multidomain SIP account, so the stripping
	  after the @ sign is done only if the whole endpoint (in multidomain case
	  1000@test.com) can't be found.

	* channel.c: Fix unbalanced read queue deadlocking local channels.

	  Using the timerfd timing module can cause channel freezing, lingering, or
	  deadlock issues.  The problem is because this is the only timing module
	  that uses an associated alert-pipe.  When the alert-pipe becomes
	  unbalanced with respect to the number of frames in the read queue bad
	  things can happen.  If the alert-pipe has fewer alerts queued than the
	  read queue then nothing might wake up the thread to handle received frames
	  from the channel driver.  For local channels this is the only way to wake
	  up the thread to handle received frames.  Being unbalanced in the other
	  direction is less of an issue as it will cause unnecessary reads into the
	  channel driver.

	  ASTERISK-26716 is an example of this deadlock which was indirectly fixed
	  by the change that found the need for this patch.

	  * In channel.c:__ast_queue_frame(): Adding frame lists to the read queue
	  did not add the same number of alerts to the alert-pipe.  Correspondingly,
	  when there is an exceptionally long queue event, any removed frames did
	  not also remove the corresponding number of alerts from the alert-pipe.

	  A dialplan intercept routine is equivalent to an interrupt routine.  As

	  media stream.  These restrictions are necessary because the media stream
	  is the responsibility of some other code and interfering with or delaying
	  that processing is bad.  A possible future dialplan processing
	  architecture change may allow the interception routine to run in a
	  different thread from the main thread handling the media and remove the
	  execution time restriction.

	* Frame deferral: Revert API refactoring.

	  There are several issues with deferring frames that are caused by the
	  refactoring.

	  1) The code deferring frames mishandles adding a deferred frame to the
	  deferred queue.  As a result the deferred queue can only be one frame
	  long.

	  2) Deferrable frames can come directly from the channel driver as well as
	  the read queue.  These frames need to be added to the deferred queue.

	  3) Whoever is deferring frames is really only doing the __ast_read() to
	  collect deferred frames and doesn't care about the returned frames except
	  to detect a hangup event.  When frame deferral is completed we must make
	  the normal frame processing see the hangup as a frame anyway.  As such,
	  there is no need to have varying hangup frame deferral methods.  We also
	  need to be aware of the AST_SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO hangup that isn't real.
	  That fake hangup is to cause the PBX thread to break out of loops to go
	  execute a new dialplan location.

	  4) To properly deal with deferrable frames from the channel driver as
	  pointed out by (2) above, means that it is possible to process a dialplan
	  interception routine while frames are deferred because of the
	  AST_CONTROL_READ_ACTION control frame.  Deferring frames is not
	  implemented as a re-entrant operation so you could have the unsupported
	  case of two sections of code thinking they have control of the media
	  stream.

	  A worse problem is because of the bad implementation of the AMI PlayDTMF
	  action.  It can cause two threads to be deferring frames on the same
	  channel at the same time.  (ASTERISK_25940)

	  * Rather than fix all these problems simply revert the API refactoring as
	  there is going to be only autoservice and safe_sleep deferring frames
	  anyway.

	* Update qualifies when AOR configuration changes.

	  Prior to this change, qualifies would only update in the following
	  cases:
	  * A reload of res_pjsip.so was issued.
	  * A dynamic contact was re-registered after its AOR's qualify_frequency
	    had been changed
	  This does not work well if you are using realtime for your AORs. You can
	  update your database to have a new qualify_frequency, but the permanent
	  contacts on that AOR will not have their qualifies updated. And the
	  dynamic contacts on that AOR will not have their qualifies updated until
	  the next registration, which could be a long time.

	  This change seeks to fix this problem by making it so that whenever AOR
	  configuration is applied, the contacts pertaining to that AOR have their
	  qualifies updated.

	  Additions from this patch:
	  * AOR sorcery objects now have an apply handler that calls into a newly
	    added function in the OPTIONS code. This causes all contacts
	    associated with that AOR to re-schedule qualifies.
	  * When it is time to qualify a contact, the OPTIONS code checks to see
	    if the AOR can still be retrieved. If not, then qualification is
	    canceled on the contact.

	  Alterations from this patch:
	  * The registrar code no longer updates contact's qualify_frequence and
	    qualify_timeout. There is no point to this since those values already
	    get updated when the AOR changes.
	  * Reloading res_pjsip.so no longer calls the OPTIONS initialization
	    function. Reloading res_pjsip.so results in re-loading AORs, which
	    results in re-scheduling qualifies.

	* app_queue: Fix queues randomly disappearing on reload

	  With 500+ queues and a reload every minute, a random queue disappears
	  upon reload. The cause is mususe of the 'dead' flag. Namely, all queues
	  were marked dead up front, and then "resurrected" by dropping this flag
	  for those found in the configuration. But a queue marked dead can be
	  removed also when control leaves the app entry point on a PBX thread.

	  With this change, the queue is marked only not found, and at the end of
	  reload only the queues that are still not found are actually marked as
	  dead, so the dead flag is never reset, and set only on positively dead
	  queues.

	* Add reload options to CLI/AMI stale object commands.

	  Marking an object as stale in a memory cache is supposed to prime the
	  cache so that the next time the item is retrieved, the stale item is
	  deleted from the cache and a background task is run to re-populate the
	  cache with a fresh version of the object.

	  The problem is, there are some object types out there for which there is
	  no natural reason that they would be retrieved from the backend with any
	  regularity. Outbound PJSIP registrations are a good example of this. At
	  startup, they are read, and an object-specific state is created that
	  refers to the initially-retrieved object for all time.

	  Adding the "reload" option to the CLI/AMI commands gives the cache the
	  opportunity to manually re-retrieve the object from the backend, both
	  storing the new object in the cache and applying the new object's
	  configuration to the module that uses that object.

	* PJPROJECT logging: Fix detection of max supported log level.

	  The mechanism used for detecting the maximum log level compiled into the
	  linked pjproject did not work.  The API call simply stores the requested
	  level into an integer and does no range checking.  Asterisk was assuming
	  that there was range checking and limited the new value to the allowable
	  range.  To get the actual maximum log level compiled into the linked
	  pjproject we need to get and save off the initial set log level from
	  pjproject.  This is the maximum log level supported.

	  * Get and save off the initial log level setting before altering it to the
	  desired level on startup.  This has to be done by a macro rather than
	  calling a core function to avoid incorrectly linking pjproject.

	  * Split the initial log level warning messages to warn if the linked
	  pjproject cannot support the requested startup level and if it is too low
	  to get the pjproject buildopts for "pjproject show buildopts".

	  * Adjust the CLI "pjproject set log level" to check the saved max log
	  level and to generate normal output messages instead of a warning message.

	* ari: Implement 'debug all' and request/response logging

	  The 'ari set debug' command has been enhanced to accept 'all' as an
	  application name.  This allows dumping of all apps even if an app
	  hasn't registered yet.  To accomplish this, a new global_debug global
	  variable was added to res/stasis/app.c and new APIs were added to
	  set and query the value.

	  'ari set debug' now displays requests and responses as well as events.
	  This required refactoring the existing debug code.

	  * The implementation for 'ari set debug' was moved from stasis/cli.{c,h}
	    to ari/cli.{c,h}, and stasis/cli.{c,h} were deleted.
	  * In order to print the body of incoming requests even if a request
	    failed, the consumption of the body was moved from the ari stubs
	    to ast_ari_callback in res_ari.c and the moustache templates were
	    then regenerated.  The body is now passed to ast_ari_invoke and then
	    on to the handlers.  This results in code savings since that template
	    was inserted multiple times into all the stubs.

	  An additional change was made to the ao2_str_container implementation
	  to add partial key searching and a sort function.  The existing cli
	  code assumed it was already there when it wasn't so the tab completion
	  was never working.

	* pjproject_bundled: Fix setting max log level

	  An earlier attempt to prevent pjsua from spitting out an extra 6795

	  turning off the ability for asterisk to output debug info when it

	  pjsystest and the pjsua python binding.  This is an asterisk-only
	  patch that does not affect pjproject functionality and will not be
	  submitted upstream.

	* abstract/fixed/adpative jitter buffer: disallow frame re-inserts

	  It was possible for a frame to be re-inserted into a jitter buffer after it
	  had been removed from it. A case when this happened was if a frame was read
	  out of the jitterbuffer, passed to the translation core, and then multiple
	  frames were returned from said translation core. Upon multiple frames being
	  returned the first is passed on, but sebsequently "chained" frames are put
	  back into the read queue. Thus it was possible for a frame to go back into
	  the jitter buffer where this would cause problems.

	  This patch adds a flag to frames that are inserted into the channel's read
	  queue after translation. The abstract jitter buffer code then checks for this
	  flag and ignores any frames marked as such.

	  The task processor queue reached X scheduled tasks message was originally

	  It is beneficial to generate the warning each time a task processor
	  reaches the high water level because PJSIP stops processing new requests

	* chan_sip: Remember SDP negotiation on SIP_CODEC_INBOUND.

	  After a SIP_CODEC_INBOUND in the dialplan, do not continue with cached formats
	  but remember the joint format. Cached formats contain default parameters,
	  often create an empty fmtp line. However, a joint format might have passed
	  format_get_joint(.) in a res_format_attr_* module (like Opus Codec) and
	  contain the resulting format parameters from a SDP negotiation.

	* pjproject_bundled:  Compile pjsua with max log level = 2

	  A while back, we changed config_site.h to set PJ_LOG_MAX_LEVEL = 6.
	  This allowed us to control the log level better from inside Asterisk.
	  An unfortunate side effect of this was that the pjsua binary and
	  python bindings were also compiled with log level set to 6 so whenever
	  a testsuite test that uses pjsua runs, it spits out 6795 lines of
	  debug in an instant even before the test starts.  I believe this
	  overruns the Jenkins capture buffer and prevents the test from
	  properly terminating.  In turn, this results in the testsuite just
	  hanging until the job is killed.  It's more frequent on the higher
	  end agents because they can spit out the messages faster.

	  Unfortunately, the messages are all spit out before we have control
	  of the python pj.Lib instance where we can set logging levels so the
	  only alternative was to actually compile pjsua and _pjsua.so with an
	  overridden PJ_LOG_MAX_LEVEL.  Although defining a lower max level was
	  done in the Makefile, the define in config_site.h had to be wrapped
	  with "#ifndef" so the change would take effect.

	* chan_pjsip: Use session for retrieving CHANNEL() information.

	  The CHANNEL() dialplan function implementation for PJSIP allows
	  querying of PJSIP specific information. This used the channel
	  passed in to get the PJSIP session and associated information.
	  It is possible for this channel to be masqueraded and end
	  up as a different channel type by the time the information
	  request is actually acted upon.

	  This change retrieves the PJSIP session safely and accesses
	  data from it (including channel). This provides a guarantee
	  that the session and channel will not be altered when the
	  request is being acted upon.

	* chan_sip: Do not allow non-SP/HTAB between header key and colon.

	  RFC says SIP headers look like:

	      HCOLON  =  *( SP / HTAB ) ":" SWS
	      SWS     =  [LWS]                    ; sep whitespace
	      LWS     =  [*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP        ; linear whitespace
	      WSP     =  SP / HTAB                ; from rfc2234

	  chan_sip implemented this:

	      HCOLON  =  *( LOWCTL / SP ) ":" SWS
	      LOWCTL  = %x00-1F                   ; CTL without DEL

	  This discrepancy meant that SIP proxies in front of Asterisk with
	  chan_sip could pass on unknown headers with \x00-\x1F in them, which
	  would be treated by Asterisk as a different (known) header.  For
	  example, the "To\x01:" header would gladly be forwarded by some proxies
	  as irrelevant, but chan_sip would treat it as the relevant "To:" header.

	  Those relying on a SIP proxy to scrub certain headers could mistakenly
	  get unexpected and unvalidated data fed to Asterisk.

	  This change fixes so chan_sip only considers SP/HTAB as valid tokens
	  before the colon, making it agree on the headers with other speakers of
	  SIP.

	* Bundled pjproject:  Fix finding SIP transactions.

	  Occasionally SIP message transactions are not found when they should be.
	  In the particular case an incoming INVITE transaction is CANCELed but the
	  INVITE transaction cannot be found so a 481 response is returned for the
	  CANCEL.  The problematic calls have a '_' character in the Via branch
	  parameter.

	  The problem is in the pjproject PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER feature's code.
	  The problem with the "own tolower" code is that it does not calculate the
	  same hash value as when the pj_tolower() function is used.  The "own
	  tolower" code will erroneously modify the ASCII characters '@', '[', '\\',
	  ']', '^', and '_'.  Calls to pj_hash_calc_tolower() can use the
	  PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER substitute algorithm when enabled.  Calls to
	  pj_hash_get_lower(), pj_hash_set_lower(), and pj_hash_set_np_lower() call
	  find_entry() which never uses the PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER algorithm.  As a
	  result you may not be able to find a hash tabled entry because the
	  calculated hash values would differ.

	  * Simply disable PJ_HASH_USE_OWN_TOLOWER.

	* http: Send headers and body in one write.

	  This is a semi-regression caused by the iostreams change. Prior to
	  iostreams, HTTP headers were written to a FILE handle using fprintf.
	  Then the body was written using a call to fwrite(). Because of internal
	  buffering, the result was that the HTTP headers and body would be sent
	  out in a single write to the socket.

	  With the change to iostreams, the HTTP headers are written using
	  ast_iostream_printf(), which under the hood calls write(). The HTTP body
	  calls ast_iostream_write(), which also calls write() under the hood.
	  This results in two separate writes to the socket.

	  Most HTTP client libraries out there will handle this change just fine.
	  However, a few of our testsuite tests started failing because of the
	  change. As a result, in order to reduce frustration for users, this
	  change alters the HTTP code to write the headers and body in a single
	  write operation.

	* Iostreams: Correct off-by-one error.

	  ast_iostream_printf() attempts first to use a fixed-size buffer to
	  perform its printf-like operation. If the fixed-size buffer is too
	  small, then a heap allocation is used instead. The heap allocation in
	  this case was exactly the length of the string to print. The issue here
	  is that the ensuing call to vsnprintf() will print a NULL byte in the
	  final space of the string. This meant that the final character was being
	  chopped off the string and replaced with a NULL byte. For HTTP in
	  particular, this caused problems because HTTP publishes the expected
	  Contact-Length. This meant HTTP was publishing a length one character
	  larger than what was actually present in the message.

	  This patch corrects the issue by adding one to the allocation length.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration.c: Filter redundant statsd reporting.

	  Increasing the testsuite shutdown timeout before forcibly killing
	  Asterisk allowed more events to be sent out.  Some tests failed as
	  a result.  The tests/channels/pjsip/statsd/registrations failed
	  because we now get the statsd events that a comment in the test
	  configuration stated couldn't be intercepted.  Unfortunately, we
	  get a variable number of events because of internal status state
	  transition races generating redundant statsd events.

	  We were reporting redundant statsd PJSIP.registrations.state changes
	  for internal state changes that equated to the same thing publicly.

	  * Made update_client_state_status() filter out redundant statsd
	  updates.

	  Changes:
	  * CRYPTO_LOCK is no longer available. Replace it with its value for now.
	    I don't completely understand what it is used for there.
	  * Remove several functions from libasteriskssl that seem to no longer be
	    needed.
	  * Structures have become opaque and are accesses with accessors.
	  * ERR_remove_thread_state() no longer needed.
	  * SSLv2 code now could no longer be used in 1.1.

	* PJPROJECT logging: Made easier to get available logging levels.

	  Use of the new logging is as simple as issuing the new CLI command or
	  setting the new pjproject.conf option.

	  Other options that can affect the logging are how you have the pjproject
	  log levels mapped to Asterisk log types in pjproject.conf and if you have
	  configured Asterisk to log the DEBUG type messages.  Altering the
	  pjproject.conf level mapping shouldn't be necessary for most installations
	  as the default mapping is sensible.  Configuring Asterisk to log the DEBUG
	  message type is standard practice for collecting debug information.

	  * Added CLI "pjproject set log level" command to dynamically adjust the
	  maximum pjproject log message level.

	  * Added CLI "pjproject show log level" command to see the currently set
	  maximum pjproject log message level.

	  * Added pjproject.conf startup section "log_level" option to set the
	  initial maximum pjproject log message level so all messages could be
	  captured from initialization.

	  * Set PJ_LOG_MAX_LEVEL to 6 to compile in all defined logging levels into
	  bundled pjproject.  Pjproject will use the currently set run time log
	  level to determine if a log message is generated just like Asterisk
	  verbose and debug logging levels.

	  * In log_forwarder(), made always log enabled and mapped pjproject log
	  messages.  DEBUG mapped log messages are no longer gated by the current
	  Asterisk debug logging level.

	  * Removed RAII_VAR() from res_pjproject.c:get_log_level().

	* Frame deferral: Re-queue deferred frames one-at-a-time.

	  The recent change that made frame deferral into an API had a behavior
	  change to it. When frame deferral was completed, we would take all of
	  the deferred frames and queue them all onto the channel in one call to
	  ast_queue_frame_head(). Before frame deferral was API-ized, places that
	  performed manual frame deferral would actually take each deferred frame
	  and queue them onto the channel.

	  This change in behavior caused the confbridge_recording test to start
	  failing consistently. Without going too crazily deep into the details,
	  a channel was getting "stuck" in an ast_safe_sleep(). An AMI redirect
	  was attempting to break it out of the sleep, but because there were more
	  frames in the channel read queue than expected, the channel ended up
	  being unable to break from its sleep loop.

	  By restoring the behavior of individual frame queuing after deferral,
	  the test starts passing again.

	  Note, this points to a potential underlying issue pointing to an
	  "unbalance" that can occur when queuing multiple frames at once,
	  and so a follow-up issue is being created to investigate that
	  possibility.

	* chan_pjsip: fix switching sending codec when asymmetric_rtp_codec=no

	  The sending codec is switched to the receiving codec and then
	  is switched back to the best native codec on EVERY receiving RTP packets.
	  This is because after call of ast_channel_set_rawwriteformat there is call
	  of ast_set_write_format which calls set_format which sets rawwriteformat
	  to the best native format.

	  This patch adds a new function ast_set_write_format_path which set
	  specific write path on channel and uses this function to switch
	  the sending codec.

	* app_originate: Add option to execute gosub prior to dial

	  Issue/patch ASTERISK-26587 was inspired by issue ASTERISK-22992
	  that requested ability to add callerid into app_originate.
	  Comments in that issue suggested that it was better solved by
	  adding an option to gosub prior to originating the call.  The
	  attached patch implements this much like app_dial with two
	  options one to gosub on the originating channel and one to gosub
	  on the newly created channel and behaves just like app_dial.
	  I have tested this patch by adding callerid info to the new
	  channel and also SIPAddHeader (to e.g. add header to force auto
	  answer) and confirmed it works.  Have also tested both 'exten'
	  and 'app' versions of app_originate.

	* res_pjsip/chan_sip: Advertise 'ws' in the SIP URI transport parameter

	  Per RFC 7118 5.2, the SIP URI 'transport' parameter should advertise
	  'ws' when WebSockets are to be used as the transport. This applies to
	  both secure and insecure WebSockets.

	  There were two bugs in Asterisk with respect to this:

	  (1) The most egregious occurs in res_pjsip. There, we advertise 'ws' for
	      insecure websockets and 'wss' for secure websockets. While this
	      would seem to make sense - since 'WS' and 'WSS' are used for the Via
	      Transport parameter - this is not the case for the SIP URI. This
	      patch corrects that by registering the secure websockets with
	      pjproject using the shorthand 'WS', and by returning 'ws' when asked
	      for the transport parameter. Note that in pjproject, it is perfectly
	      valid to have multiple transports use the same shorthand.

	  (2) In chan_sip, we return an upper-case version of the transport 'WS'
	      instead of 'ws'. Since we should be strict in what we send and
	      liberal in what we accept (within reason), this patch lower-cases
	      the transport before appending it to the parameter.

	* chan_sip: Fix segfault during module unload

	  If a TCP/TLS connection was pending (not accepted and not timed out) during
	  unload of chan_sip, Asterisk would segfault when trying to send a signal to
	  a thread whose thread ID hadn't been recorded yet. This commit fixes that by
	  recording the thread ID before calling the blocking connect() syscall.
	  This was a regression introduced by 776a14386a55b5425c7e9617eff8af8b45427144.

	  The above wasn't enough to fix the segfault, which was now delayed to the
	  point where connect() timed out. Therefore, it was necessary to also remove
	  the SA_RESTART flag from the SIGURG sigaction so that pthread_kill() could be
	  used to interruput the connect() syscall.
	  This was a regression introduced by 5d313f51b982a18f7321adcf7c7a4e822d8b2714.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: RTT miscalculation in RTCP

	  When retrieving RTCP stats for PJSIP channels, RTT values are unreliable.
	  RTT calculation is correct, but the data representation isn't.  RTT is
	  represented by a 32-bit fixed-point number with the integer part in the
	  first 16 bits and the fractional part in the last 16 bits.  In order to
	  get the RTT value, the fractional part is miscalculated, there is an
	  unnecessary 16 bit shift that causes overflow.  Besides this there is
	  another mistake, when transforming the integer value to the fixed point
	  fractional part via bitwise operation, that loses precision.

	  * RTT fractional part is no longer shifted, avoiding overflow.

	  * RTT fractional part is transformed to its fixed-point value more
	  precisely.

	  * Fixed timeval2ntp() and ntp2timeval() second fraction conversions.

	* pjproject: Use a much higher limit for PJ_ICE_MAX_CHECKS

	  The PJ_ICE_MAX_CHECKS constant is used by pjproject to determine how
	  many pairs of local/remote candidates will be made. If for some reason
	  we reach this upper bound, ICE will generally fail and no media will
	  flow between the browser and Asterisk.

	  This patch makes PJ_ICE_MAX_CHECKS set to the total possible number of
	  pairs of candidates we'd theoretically allow, which is
	  PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND^2. Prior to this patch, we simply multiplied
	  PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND by two; on systems with multiple interfaces (I blame
	  Docker), this is far too low to allow WebRTC calls to succeed.

	  Setting this to be PJ_ICE_MAX_CAND^2 allowed WebRTC calls to succeed
	  even when the system Asterisk was running on had quite a few virtual
	  interfaces.

	* apps/app_echo: Only relay a single video source change frame

	  In 9785e8d0, app_echo was updated to relay video source updates to the
	  channel for the purposes of displaying video in WebRTC tests.
	  Unfortunately, this can cause a Kafkaesque nightmare if two or more
	  Local channels are in a bridge together where their ends are in
	  app_echo. When this situation occurs, a video update sent into app_echo
	  will cause the video update to be relayed to the other Local channels,
	  causing another round of video updates, etc. In not much time at all,
	  the channel length queues will be overwhelmed, channel alert pipes will
	  fail, and all hell will break loose as Asterisk merrily continues to
	  throw more video update requests onto the channels.

	  This patch updates app_echo to *only* relay a single video update. Once
	  a video update has been made, all further video updates are dropped.
	  This meets the intended purpose of the original patch: if we get a video
	  update and we're in app_echo, go ahead and ask the sender to update
	  themselves. However, once we've got that video stream sync'd up, don't
	  keep spamming the world.

	* res/ari/resource_bridges: Add the ability to manipulate the video source

	  In multi-party bridges, Asterisk currently supports two video modes:
	   * Follow the talker, in which the speaker with the most energy is shown
	     to all participants but the speaker, and the speaker sees the
	     previous video source
	   * Explicitly set video sources, in which all participants see a locked
	     video source

	  Prior to this patch, ARI had no ability to manipulate the video source.
	  This isn't important for two-party bridges, in which Asterisk merely
	  relays the video between the participants. However, in a multi-party
	  bridge, it can be advantageous to allow an external application to
	  manipulate the video source.

	  This patch provides two new routes to accomplish this:
	  (1) setVideoSource: POST /bridges/{bridgeId}/videoSource/{channelId}
	      Sets a video source to an explicit channel
	  (2) clearVideoSource: DELETE /bridges/{bridgeId}/videoSource
	      Removes any explicit video source, and sets the video mode to talk
	      detection

2016-11-11 00:29 +0000 [939dcf66b0]  Timo Teräs <timo.teras@iki.fi>

	* addons/chan_mobile: do not use strerror_r

	  The two reasons why it might be used are that some systems do not
	  implement strerror in thread safe manner, and that strerror_r returns
	  the error code in the string in case there's no error message.

	  However, all of asterisk elsewhere uses strerror() and assumes it
	  to be thread safe. And in chan_mobile the errno is also explicitly
	  printed so neither of the above reasons are valid.

	  The reasoning to remove usage is that there are actually two versions
	  of strerror_r: XSI and GNU. They are incompatible in their return
	  value, and there's no easy way to figure out which one is being
	  used. glibc gives you the GNU version if _GNU_SOURCE is defined,
	  but the same feature test macro is needed for other symbols. On
	  all other systems you assumedly get XSI symbol, and compilation warnings
	  as well as non-working error printing.

	  Thus the easiest solution is to just remove strerror_r and use
	  strerror as rest of the code. Alternative is to introduce ast_strerror
	  in separate translation unit so it can request the XSI symbol in
	  glibc case, and replace all usage of strerror.

	* res_pjsip_session: Do not call session supplements when it's too late.

	  res_pjsip_sesssion was hooking into transaction and invite state
	  changes. One of the reasons for doing so was due to the
	  PJSIP_EVENT_TX_MSG event. The idea was that we were hooking into the
	  message sending process, and so we should call session supplements to
	  alter the outgoing message.

	  In reality, this event was meant to indicate that the message either
	  a) had already been sent, or
	  b) required a DNS lookup and would be sent when the DNS query
	  completed.

	  In case (a), this meant we were altering an already-sent
	  request/response for no reason. In case (b), this potentially meant we
	  could be trying to alter a request/response at the same time that the
	  DNS resolution completed. In this case, it meant we might be stomping on
	  memory being used by the thread actually sending the message. This
	  caused potential crashes and memory corruption.

	  This patch removes the calls to session supplements from the case where
	  the PJSIP_EVENT_TX_MSG event occurs. In all of these cases, trying to
	  alter the message at this point is too late, and it can cause nothing
	  but harm to try to do it. Because there were no longer any calls to the
	  handle_outgoing() function, it has been removed.

	* AGI: Only defer frames when in an interception routine.

	  AGI recently was modified to defer important frames. This was because
	  when AGI was used in a connected line interception routine, the
	  resulting connected line frame would end up getting discarded by the
	  AGI.

	  However, this caused bad behavior in other cases. Specifically, during a
	  transfer, if someone attempted to manually set the Caller ID on a
	  channel in an AGI, the deferred connected line frame would end up
	  overwriting what had been manually set in the AGI.

	  Since the initial issue was specific to interception routines, this
	  change removes the manual frame deferral from AGI and instead uses the
	  new frame deferral API in interception routines.

	  Not surprisingly, using Respoke (and possibly other systems) it is
	  possible to blow past the 16k limit for a WebSocket packet size. This
	  patch bumps it up to 32k, which, at least for Respoke, is sufficient.
	  For now.

	  Because 32k is laughable on a LOW_MEMORY system (as is 16k, for that
	  matter), this patch adds a LOW_MEMORY directive that sets the buffer to
	  8k for systems who have asked for their reduced memory availability to
	  be considered.

	* res_stasis: Set a video source mode on Stasis created bridges

	  When a bridge is created via ARI (through res_stasis), no video source
	  mode is set by default. As a result, any endpoint sending video media
	  won't ever see any video reflected back to it.

	  This patch defaults a bridge to a 'follow the talker' video mode.
	  Further work can be done to add routes that allow for the video mode to
	  be controlled through the /bridges resource.

	* main/bridge_channel: Fix channel reference leak on video source

	  When a channel is made the video source, the bridge holds a reference to
	  it. Whenever the video source changes, that reference is released.
	  However, a ref leak does occur if the channel leaves the bridge (such as
	  being hung up) while it is the video source, as the bridge never
	  releases the ref in such a case.

	  This patch adds a line to the bridge_channel_internal_join routine such
	  that, when a channel finishes its time in the bridge, it notifies the
	  bridge via ast_bridge_remove_video_src that if it is a video source its
	  reference should be released.

	* main/bridge: Add some verbose logging for video source changes

	  It's actually quite useful to see the source of a video stream change.
	  This doesn't happen terribly often, even with talk detection - but when
	  it does, it's nice to know which channel is now providing your video
	  stream.

	  As a verbose 5 level message, it shouldn't be terribly spammy or costly
	  to have, and is 'lower level' then most other verbose messages that the
	  bridge system emits.

	* bridges/bridge_softmix: Remove SSRC changes on join/leave; update video source

	  WebRTC clients really, really want to know the SSRC of the media they're
	  getting. Changing the SSRC is generally not a good thing.

	  bridge_softmix, starting in Asterisk 12, started changing the SSRC of
	  parties as they joined or left the bridge. With most phones, this isn't
	  a problem: phones just play back the stream they're getting. With WebRTC
	  clients, however, the SSRC is tied to a media stream that may be
	  negotiated. When a new SSRC just shows up, the media can be dropped.

	  As it turns out, the SSRC change shouldn't even be necessary. From the
	  perspective of the client, it's still talking to Asterisk with the same
	  media stream: why indicate that the far party has suddenly changed to a
	  different source of media?

	  This patch opts to just remove the SSRC changes. With this patch, video
	  clients that join/leave a softmix bridge actually get the video stream
	  instead of freaking out.

	* stasis_recording/stored: remove calls to deprecated readdir_r function.

	  The readdir_r function has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This
	  patch removes the readdir_r dependency (replaced it with readdir) and also moves
	  the directory search code to a more centralized spot (file.c)

	  Also removed a strict dependency on the dirent structure's d_type field as it
	  is not portable. The code now checks to see if the value is available. If so,
	  it tries to use it, but defaults back to using the stats function if necessary.

	  Lastly, for most implementations of readdir it *should* be thread-safe to make
	  concurrent calls to it as long as different directory streams are specified.
	  glibc falls into this category. However, since it is possible that there exist
	  some implementations that are not safe, locking has been added for those other
	  than glibc.

	* pjproject_bundled:  Fix issue with libasteriskpj needing libresample

	  libresample is only needed by pjproject if we're building pjsua, which
	  we only do if TEST_FRAMEWORK is selected.  It's required by pjsua to
	  process audio which is needed by some testsuite tests.  Unfortunately,
	  pjproject relies on a newer version of libresample than the version
	  that ships by most distros so we need to compile the version that's
	  bundled with pjproject.  Since we only need it for pjsua, we DON'T want
	  it's symbols exposed when we actually build asterisk.

	  There was a problem however... TEST_FRAMEWORK is only known AFTER we've
	  already run ./configure on both asterisk and pjproject but pjproject's
	  ./configure needs to test it to know whether to set up to build
	  libresample or not.  The previous way of figuring this out was to
	  always tell ./configure "yes" but not actually build the library.  This
	  caused an issue where building libasteriskpj was being told to include
	  libresample but it wasn't actually there.

	  The solution is to still do a default pjproject configure during an
	  asterisk ./configure but if makeopts or menuselect.makeopts changes
	  subsequently, we now reconfigure pjproject, taking into account the
	  current state of TEST_FRAMEWORK.  Previously, if makeopts or
	  menuselect.makeopts changed, only a recompile of pjproject was done.

	* app_dial: Fix incorrect device state when channel is picked up.

	  Given the scenario where multiple channels are dialed using Dial()
	  but the caller is picked up using PickupChan() all outgoing channels
	  except the channel specified to PickupChan() would be marked
	  as ringing until the call had been hung up.

	  When using the PickupChan application the channel executing the
	  application is swapped into place of another channel. As part
	  of this process the channel is answered. The Dial application
	  has explicit logic which checks if the channel is answered,
	  cancels all other outgoing channels, and bridges. This logic is
	  different than the normal logic that is executed when an outgoing
	  channel is answered. This different logic failed to publish dial
	  events stating that the other outgoing channels had been canceled.
	  As a result references to the outgoing channels were held onto by
	  the dial masquerade process until the call had been ended and
	  the channels had gone away. This would result in the channels
	  appearing in the "core show channels" list despite not being present
	  anymore and would also result in incorrect device state.

	  This change makes it so that this logic also publishes
	  dial events stating that the other outgoing channels have been
	  canceled.

	* pjsip: Fix a few media bugs with reinvites and asymmetric payloads.

	  When channel format changes occurred as a result of an RTP
	  re-negotiation the bridge was not informed this had happened.
	  As a result the bridge technology was not re-evaluated and the
	  channel may have been in a bridge technology that was incompatible
	  with its formats. The bridge is now unbridged and the technology
	  re-evaluated when this occurs.

	  The chan_pjsip module also allowed asymmetric codecs for sending
	  and receiving. This did not work with all devices and caused one
	  way audio problems. The default has been changed to NOT do this
	  but to match the sending codec to the receiving codec. For users
	  who want asymmetric codecs an option has been added, asymmetric_rtp_codec,
	  which will return chan_pjsip to the previous behavior.

	  The codecs returned by the chan_pjsip module when queried by
	  the bridge_native_rtp module were also not reflective of the
	  actual negotiated codecs. The nativeformats are now returned as
	  they reflect the actual negotiated codecs.

	* test_astobj2_thrash:  Fix multithreaded issues

	  The test uses 4 threads to grow, count, lookup and shrink 15K objects
	  in a container.  If there's only 1 execution engine available, the test
	  will complete in <50ms.  If each threads gets its own execution engine,
	  the test may timeout after 60 seconds because the count thread does a
	  locked ao2_callback on the whole container in a tight loop with only
	  a sched_yield to give up time.  The lock contention makes the test
	  execution times wildly variable and mostly timeout.  2 execution
	  engines are OK, 3 results in about 33% failure rate and >=4 causes
	  a 80% failure rate.

	  To fix, the sched_yield was changed to a usleep(500).

	  Also, the number of buckets specified for the container was an even
	  number so that was changed to the next prime number greater than
	  (MAX_HASH_ENTRIES / 100).  That's 151 currently.

	* ARI: Detect duplicate channel IDs

	  ARI and AMI allow for an explicit channel ID to be specified
	  when originating channels. Unfortunately, there is nothing in
	  place to prevent someone from using the same ID for multiple
	  channels. Further complicating things, adding ID validation to channel
	  allocation makes it impossible for ARI to discern why channel allocation
	  failed, resulting in a vague error code being returned.

	  The fix for this is to institute a new method for channel errors to be
	  discerned. The method mirrors errno, in that when an error occurs, the
	  caller can consult the channel errno value to determine what the error
	  was. This initial iteration of the feature only introduces "unknown" and
	  "channel ID exists" errors. However, it's possible to add more errors as
	  needed.

	  ARI uses this feature to determine why channel allocation failed and can
	  return a 409 error during origination to show that a channel with the
	  given ID already exists.

	* CDR: Alter destruction pattern for CDR chains.

	  CDRs form chains. When the root of the chain is destroyed, it then
	  unreferences the next CDR in the chain. That CDR is destroyed, and it
	  then unreferences the next CDR in the chain. This repeats until the end
	  of the chain is reached. While this typically does not cause any sort of
	  problems, it is possible in strange scenarios for the CDR chain to grow
	  way longer than expected. In such a scenario, the destruction pattern
	  can result in a stack overflow.

	  This patch fixes the problem by switching from a recursive pattern to an
	  iterative pattern for destruction. When the root CDR is destroyed, it is
	  responsible for iterating over the rest of the CDRs and unreferencing
	  each one. Other CDRs in the chain, since they are not the root, will
	  simply destroy themselves and be done. This causes the stack depth not
	  to increase.

	* chan_sip: Only send video on outgoing channel if incoming channel supports it

	  Previously, the settings videosupport=always and videosupport=yes behaved

	  This commit restores correct behavior: videosupport=always causes a video offer
	  to be sent unconditionally, while videosupport=yes will only offer video on an
	  outbound channel if the incoming channel it is bridged to also supports video.
	  That way, the device receiving the outgoing call can display the correct user
	  interface elements for audio or video and will not unnecessarily show a blank
	  video window on an audio-only call.

	* res_config_mysql:  Fix several issues related to recent table changes

	  Unlike any of the other database drivers, res_config_mysql checks that
	  the table definition matches the requirements for every insert and
	  update statement.  Since all requirements are forced to 'char', any
	  column that isn't a char, like ps_contacts' expiration_time,
	  qualify_timeout, etc., will throw a warning.  It's kinda harmless but
	  very misleading.  Since no other driver does those checks on insert
	  or update, they've been removed from res_config_mysql.  Also, all
	  the logic that actually attempted to ALTER the table to fix the issue
	  has been removed.  With the move to alembic, the auto-alter
	  functionality is not only unnecessary, it's also dangerous.

	  The other issue is that res_config_mysql calls the mysql_insert_id
	  function inside store_mysql.  Presumably the intention was to return
	  the number of rows inserted DESPITE A NOTE IN THE CODE THAT THE VALUE
	  IS NON_PORTABLE AND MAY CHANGE.  That value is then returned to
	  config realtime as the number of rows inserted.  Guess what?  The value
	  changed.  It now only returns the number of rows inserted if there's an
	  auto increment column on the table, which ps_contacts doesn't have.
	  Otherwise it returns 0.  So now, the insert worked but we tell config
	  realtime and sorcery that no rows were inserted.  That call to
	  mysql_insert_id was removed and we now always return 1 if the insert
	  succeeded.  We're only inserting 1 row at a time anyway.  If the insert
	  fails, we still return -1.

	* chan_sip: Support nat=auto_comedia or nat=force_rport,auto_comedia.

	  In the SIP channel driver chan_sip, auto_comedia was expected to be used in
	  tandem with auto_force_rport. Or stated differently: Only when auto_force_rport
	  was chosen (the default), auto_comedia worked. This change allows auto_comedia
	  to be set independently of the state of (auto_)force_rport. For example,
	  nat=force_rport,auto_comedia is useful for IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack deployments
	  when IPv6 clients are behind a Firewall.

	* audiohooks: Remove redundant codec translations when using audiohooks

	  The main frame read and write handlers in main/channel.c don't use the
	  optimum placement in the processing flow for calling audiohooks
	  callbacks, as far as codec translation is concerned. This change places
	  the audiohooks callback code:
	   * After the channel read translation if the frame is not linear before
	  the translation, thereby increasing the chance that the frame is linear
	  as required by audiohooks
	   * Before the channel write translation if the frame is linear at this
	  point
	  This prevents the audiohooks code from instantiating additional
	  translation paths to/from linear where a linear frame format is already
	  available, saving valuable CPU cycles

	* res_calendar: Add support for fetching calendars when reloading

	  We use a lot res_calendar, we are very happy with that, especially
	  because you use libical, the almost alone opensource library that
	  supports really ical format with all types of recurrency.

	  Nevertheless, some features are missed for our business use cases.

	  This first patch adds a new option in calendar.conf:
	  fetch_again_at_reload. Be my guest for a better name.

	  If it's true, when you'll launch "module reload res_calendar.so",
	  Asterisk will download again the calendar.

	  The business use case is that we have a WebUI with a scheduler planner,
	  we know when the calendars are modified.

	  For now, we need to define 1 minute of timeout to have a chance that
	  our user doesn't wait too long between the modification and the real
	  test.  But it generates a lot of useless HTTP traffic.

	  whether the download program is wget, curl or fetch.

	  Added a 'configure.m4' file to the third-party directory which takes

	  Removed regeneration of the pjproject aconfigure file.  It was only

	* pjproject_bundled:  Add MALLOC_DEBUG capability

	  pjproject_bundled will now use the asterisk memory debugging APIs
	  if MALLOC_DEBUG is turned on in menuselect.

	  Because this required stubs for the executable programs and the python
	  bindings, some Makefile reorganization was needed to properly handle
	  the dependencies.  As a result, the makefile now individually makes
	  each of the pjproject libraries separately instead of making them all
	  in 1 shot.  The only visible change is that there are separate status
	  lines printed for each library instead oif 1 for all libs.  Also, the
	  making of the pjproject dependency files was eliminated.  They're not
	  needed for building unless you're actively modifying pjproject source
	  files and it makes the build process faster.  Finally, any issues with
	  parallel builds should be resolved again making the build faster.

	* alembic:  Allow cdr, config and voicemail to exist in the same schema

	  cdr, config and voicemail are all separate alembic trees.  Because
	  alembic's default is to use a table named 'alembic_version' to store
	  the current tree revision, the 3 trees can't exist in the same schema
	  without stepping on each other.

	  Now each tree uses 'alembic_version_<tree_name>' as the version table.
	  Each tree's env.py script now first checks for 'alembic_version'.  If
	  it finds it AND its revision is in the tree's history, the script
	  renames it to 'alembic_version_<tree_name>'.  Regardless, the script
	  then continues with the migration using 'alembic_version_<tree_name>'
	  and creates that table if it's not found.  The result is that if an
	  existing 'alembic_version' table was found but it didn't belong to this
	  tree, it's left alone and 'alembic_version_<tree_name>' is used or
	  created.

	  WARNING:  If multiple trees are using the same schema, they MUST NOT
	  CRU or D any objects with names that might exist in the other trees.
	  An example would be 'yesno_values' type.  If two trees perform
	  operations on it, one tree could pull it out from under the other.
	  Thankfully we currently don't share any names among cdr, config and
	  voicemail.

	  NOTE:  Since the env.py scripts in each tree were identical, a common
	  env.py has been placed in the ast-db-manage directory and a symlink
	  to it has been placed in each tree directory.

	  In the SIP channel driver chan_sip, the default is "auto_force_rport". When no

	  but reuse the port of the transport. This did not happen because of a typo.

	* app_queue: Update dynamic members ringinuse on reload.

	  Previously, when reloading the members of a queue, the members added statically
	  (i.e. defined in queues.conf) would see their "ringinuse" value updated but not
	  the members added dynamically.

	  This change makes dynamic members ringuse value to be updated on reload.

	  Note that it's impossible to add a dynamic member with a specific ringinuse
	  value. For both static and dynamic members, the ringinuse value can always be
	  changed later on with command like "queue set ringinuse" or with the AMI action
	  "QueueMemberRingInUse". So it's possible this commit could break a user workflow
	  if he was changing the ringinuse value of dynamic members via such commands and
	  was also relying on the fact that a queue reload would not update the dynamic
	  members ringinuse value.

	* build_tools:  Add ability to download variants to download_externals

	  Some external packages have multiple variants that apply to different
	  builds of asterisk.  The DPMA for instance has a "bundled" variant that
	  needs to be downloaded if asterisk was configured with
	  --with-pjproject-bundled.

	  There are 2 ways to specify variants:

	  If you need the user to make the decision about which variant to
	  download, simply create multiple menuselect "member" entries like so...

	  <member name="res_digium_phone" displayname="..snipped..">
	    <support_level>external</support_level>
	    <depend>xmlstarlet</depend>
	    <depend>bash</depend>
	    <defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	  </member>

	  <member name="res_digium_phone-bundled" displayname="..snipped..">
	    <support_level>external</support_level>
	    <depend>xmlstarlet</depend>
	    <depend>bash</depend>
	    <defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	  </member>

	  Note that the second entry has "-<variant>" appended to the name.
	  You can then use the existing menuselect facilities to restrict which
	  members to enable or disable.  Youy probably don't want the user to
	  enable multiple at the same time.

	  If you want to hide the details of the variants, the better way to
	  do it is to create 1 member with "variant" elements.

	  <member name="res_digium_phone" displayname="..snipped..">
	    <support_level>external</support_level>
	    <depend>xmlstarlet</depend>
	    <depend>bash</depend>
	    <defaultenabled>no</defaultenabled>
	    <member_data>
	      <downloader>
	        <variants>
	          <variant tag="bundled"
	            condition='[[ "$PJPROJECT_BUNDLED" = "yes" ]]'/>
	        </variants>
	      </downloader>
	    </member_data>
	  </member>

	  The condition must be a bash expression suitable for use with an "if"
	  statement.  Any environment variable can be used plus those available
	  in makeopts.

	  In this case, if asterisk was configured with --with-pjproject-bundled
	  the bundled variant will be automatically downloaded.  Otherwise the
	  normal version will be downloaded.

	* chan_sip: Resolve externhost not to IPv6; instead go for IPv4.

	  For the channel driver chan_sip, you specify externhost=example.com in sip.conf
	  when your Asterisk is behind a NAT and your IP address is assigned dynamically.
	  Or stated differently: You do not have a static IP address to use "externaddr"
	  directly. This NAT support is quite handy but just about IPv4. Previously,
	  Asterisk resolved "externhost" to any IP version. When the first DNS answer
	  resolved to an IPv6, Asterisk sent an IPv6 in SIP/SDP for origin (o=) and
	  connection (c=). This happened in outgoing SIP-REGISTER and while answering
	  SIP-INVITE. If the remote peer is IPv4-only, it might not handle o=/c= with an
	  IPv6. This change makes sure, no IPv6 is resolved anymore for "externhost".

	* chan_sip:  Address runaway when realtime peers subscribe to mailboxes

	  Users upgrading from asterisk 13.5 to a later version and who use
	  realtime with peers that have mailboxes were experiencing runaway
	  situations that manifested as a continuous stream of taskprocessor
	  congestion errors, memory leaks and an unresponsive chan_sip.

	  A related issue was that setting rtcachefriends=no NEVER worked in
	  asterisk 13 (since the move to stasis).  In 13.5 and earlier, when a
	  peer tried to register, all of the stasis threads would block and
	  chan_sip would again become unresponsive.  After 13.5, the runaway
	  would happen.

	  There were a number of causes...
	  * mwi_event_cb was (indirectly) calling build_peer even though calls to
	    mwi_event_cb are often caused by build_peer.
	  * In an effort to prevent chan_sip from being unloaded while messages
	    were still in flight, destroy_mailboxes was calling
	    stasis_unsubscribe_and_join but in some cases waited forever for the
	    final message.
	  * add_peer_mailboxes wasn't properly marking the existing mailboxes
	    on a peer as "keep" so build_peer would always delete them all.
	  * add_peer_mwi_subs was unsubscribing existing mailbox subscriptions
	    then just creating them again.

	  All of this was causing a flood of subscribes and unsubscribes on
	  multiple threads all for the same peer and mailbox.

	  Fixes...
	  * add_peer_mailboxes now marks mailboxes correctly and build_peer only
	    deletes the ones that really are no longer needed by the peer.
	  * add_peer_mwi_subs now only adds subscriptions marked as "new" instead
	    of unsubscribing and resubscribing everything.  It also adds the peer
	    object's address to the mailbox instead of its name to the subscription
	    userdata so mwi_event_cb doesn't have to call build_peer.

	  With these changes, with rtcachefriends=yes (the most common setting),
	  there are no leaks, locks, loops or crashes at shutdown.

	  rtcachefriends=no still causes leaks but at least it doesn't lock, loop
	  or crash.  Since making rtcachefriends=no work wasnt in scope for this
	  issue, further work will have to be deferred to a separate patch.

	  Side fixes...
	   * The ast_lock_track structure had a member named "thread" which gdb
	     doesn't like since it conflicts with it's "thread" command.  That
	     member was renamed to "thread_id".

	* logger: Always enable verbose for console channel.

	  Previous versions of Asterisk did not require verbose to be specified in
	  logger.conf for the console channel, if it was requested by command line
	  or asterisk.conf it just worked.  This change causes Asterisk to always
	  enable verbose in the console channel level mask.  Verbose is displayed
	  on consoles if requested by command line, option_verbose or 'core set
	  verbose'.

	  This also delays initialization of the logger until after threadstorage
	  is initialized.  Initializing too early can cause messages to be printed
	  multiple times to the console (stdout).

	* rtp: Only accept the first payload for a format in SDP.

	  When receiving an SDP offer with multiple payloads for
	  the same format we would generate an answer with the first
	  payload, but during the payload crossover operation
	  (to set the payloads for receiving) we would remove all
	  payloads but the last. This would result in incoming
	  traffic being matched against the wrong format and outgoing
	  traffic being sent using the wrong payload.

	  This change makes it so that once a format has a payload
	  number put into the mapping all subsequent ones are ignored.
	  This ensures there is only ever one payload in the mapping
	  and that it is the payload placed into the answer SDP.

	* res_pjsip_multihomed: Change Contact port to listening port.

	  The res_pjsip_multihomed module determines what interface and transport
	  a request is going out on and updates the SIP message accordingly with
	  the address information. This currently incorrectly updates the Contact
	  header for connectionful protocols to the ephemeral connection port,
	  instead of the bound address for the listening socket which can actually
	  accept the connection back. If the remote side attempts to connect back on
	  the epehemeral port it will fail.

	  This change makes it so the port is updated to the bound port on
	  connectionful protocols and is maintained on UDP (as there can be
	  multiple of those).

	* pjproject_bundled:  Prevent SERVFAIL from marking name server bad

	  A name server that returns "Server Failure" is indicating only that
	  the server couldn't process that particular request.  We should NOT
	  assume that the name server is incapable of serving other requests.

	  Here's the scenario we've been encountering...

	  * 2 local name servers configured in resolv.conf.
	  * An OPTIONS request causes a request for A and AAAA records to go out
	    to both nameservers.
	  * The A responses both come back successfully resolved.
	  * Because of an issue at some upstream nameserver, the AAAA responses
	    for that particular query come back as "SERVFAIL" from both local
	    name servers.
	  * Both local servers are marked as bad and no further queries can be
	    sent until the 60 second ttl expires.  Only previously cached results
	    can be used.
	  * In this case, 60 seconds is just enough time for another OPTIONS
	    request to go out to the same host so the cycle repeats.

	  We could set the bad ttl really low but that also affects REFUSED and
	  NOTAUTH which probably DO signal a real server issue.  Besides, even
	  a really low bad ttl would be an issue on a pbx.

	  Although we use our own resolver in 14 and master and don't have this
	  issue there, Teluu has merged this patch upstream so it's appropriate
	  to cherry-pick to 14 and master to keep pjproject consistent.

	  sd_notify() is used to notify systemd of changes to the status of the
	  process. This allows the systemd daemon to know when the process
	  finished loading (and thus only start another program after Asterisk has
	  finished loading).

	  To use this, use a systemd unit with 'Type=notify' for Asterisk.

	  sd_notify that does nothing if not built with systemd support.

	  Also adds support for libsystemd detection in the configure script.

	* rtp: Preserve timestamps on video frames.

	  Currently when receiving video over RTP we store only
	  a calculated samples on the frame. When starting the video
	  it can take some time for this calculation to actually yield
	  a value as it requires constant changing timestamps. As well
	  if a video frame passes over multiple RTP packets this calculation
	  will fail as the timestamp is the same as the previous RTP
	  packet and the number of samples calculated will be 0.

	  This change preserves the timestamp on the frame and allows
	  it to pass through the core. When sending the video this timestamp
	  is used instead of a new one being calculated.

	* res_pjsip: Do not crash on ACKs from unknown endpoints.

	  The endpoint identification PJSIP module is intended to identify which
	  endpoint an incoming request is from. If an endpoint is not identified,
	  then an artificial endpoint is used in its place when proceeding.

	  The problem is that the ACK request type is an exception to the rule.
	  The artificial endpoint is not used when processing an ACK. This results
	  in the possibility of having a NULL endpoint being used further on.

	  The reason ACK is an exception is an attempt not to spam security logs
	  with unidentified requests. Presumably, you've already logged the
	  unidentified request on the preceeding INVITE.

	  Up until Asterisk 13.10, retrieving a NULL endpoint in this fashion
	  didn't cause an issue. A new change in 13.10 added endpoint ACL checking
	  shortly after endpoint identification. Because we are accessing a NULL
	  endpoint, this ACL check resulted in a crash.

	  The fix here is to be sure to retrieve the artificial endpoint for all
	  request types. ACKs still do not generate unidentified request security
	  events.

	  determines SIP-over-TLS as preferred transport. In SIP/SDP, the phone starts
	  the call with a crypto attribute, but not as RTP/sAVP but the RTP/AVP profile
	  (sRTP is preferred aka optional; not mandatory). If the VoIP server does not
	  support sRTP and TLS, the phone shows an open padlock icon.

	  This paradigm is supported by several VoIP/SIP clients on default. Some
	  implementations even cannot be changed to RTP/sAVP. Therefore here, this
	  change allows Preferred sRTP for ingress. For egress, please, create a dial
	  plan which starts with RTP/SAVP, and when rejected tries again with RTP/AVP.

	* res/res_stasis_playback: Cancel the entire playlist when a stop occurs

	  Prior to this patch, a stop issued by a delete of a Playback resource
	  (indicated by the control frame AST_CONTROL_STREAM_STOP) would only stop
	  the current media URI playing. Subsequent URIs specified by a playback
	  operation would then proceed on, even though we had just indicated to
	  the User that the Playback was finished *and* after they had just
	  'deleted' the resource. Whoops.

	  This patch corrects it by bailing out of the sequence of URIs to play if
	  one of them is terminated with an AST_CONTROL_STREAM_STOP indication.

	* build: Add download capability for external packages

	  The DPMA and g729a, silk, siren7 and siren14 codecs hosted at
	  http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/ are now listed in the
	  "External" sections of the "Resource Modules" and "Codec Translators"
	  pages in menuselect.  Any that are selected will automatically be
	  downloaded and installed when "make install" is run.  Their LICENSE and
	  README (if avaialble) files will be installed to
	  ASTVARLIBDIR/documentation/thirdparty/<product_name>.

	  Example use with codecs:

	  The codecs/codecs.xml file is a menuselect style xml file that lists
	  the codecs to be included.  Their support levels are 'external', which
	  triggers the download and install, and defaultenabled is no.  Also
	  because codec_g729a is actually in a directory named codec_g729 on the
	  download server, the newly added 'member_data' element is used to
	  override the default of the directory name being the package name.  You
	  can use the 'directory_name' attribute to keep default base URL
	  (http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/) but use the new directory,
	  or you use the 'remote_url' attribute to specify a full URL to the
	  download directory.  In this case, you must still follow the same
	  subdirectory naming conventions as that used for the packages located
	  at 'http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony'.

	  A new configure option '--with-externals-cache' was added and like
	  '--with-sounds-cache' it allows the installer to cache tarballs so
	  they're not downloaded every time.

	  To assist with the download and install process, each external package
	  now has a manifest.xml file that, among other things, contains a package
	  version and checksums for each file in the tarball.  The manifest is
	  saved to both the cache directory and ASTMODDIR and together with the
	  manifest.xml on the downloads site, tells the install scripts whether
	  a download and/or update is needed.

	  bash and xmlstarlet are required for downloader operation.  If they're
	  not installed, the external items in menuselect will be unavailable.

	* res_pjsip_session: segfault on already disconnected session

	  On heavy loaded system the TCP/TLS incoming calls could be
	  disconnected by pjproject while these calls are being
	  processed by asterisk which could use the session's memory pools.
	  If the session in the disconnected state then the session memory
	  pools were already freed, so we get segfault.

	  This patch adds a lifetime control on an INVITE session to pjproject.
	  The lifetime of the session is manipulated by calling
	  pjsip_inv_add_ref/pjsip_inv_dec_ref.
	  This patch uses these functions to inform pjproject that the
	  session is in use.

	  This patch adds check if the session state is not disconnected
	  and also checks if the memory pool is not NULL.

	  This patch also places tasks 'session_end' and 'session_end_completion'
	  into session's serializer to avoid race condition.

	* chan_sip: Don't refuse calls with "optional crypto"; fall back to RTP.

	  Certain SNOM phones send so-called "optional crypto" in their SDP body.
	  Regular SRTP setup looks like this:

	      m=audio 64620 RTP/SAVP 8 0 9 99 3 18 4 101
	      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 inline:...

	  SNOM-style "optional crypto" looks like this:

	      m=audio 61438 RTP/AVP 8 0 9 99 3 18 4 101
	      a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 inline:...

	  A crypto line is supplied, but the m-line does not have SAVP.

	  When res_srtp.so is *not* loaded, then chan_sip.so treats the optional
	  crypto as regular RTP, but when res_srtp.so *is* loaded, it refuses the
	  incoming call with the following message:

	      WARNING: process_sdp: Failed to receive SDP offer/answer with
	      required SRTP crypto attributes for audio

	  For platforms that want to start providing SRTP this presents a
	  compatibility problem.

	  This changeset lets chan_sip handle the SDP as if no crypto-line was
	  supplied: i.e. accept the call as regular RTP, just like it did before
	  res_srtp was loaded.

	  Now you'll get this informative warning instead:

	      WARNING: Ignoring crypto attribute in SDP because RTP transport is
	      insecure

	* app_mp3: Use correct buffer size and the same sample rate as the channel

	  Previously, the buffer used for MP3 streamed from HTTP servers had a size of
	  1 MB. For 8 kHz mono audio at 16 bit resolution, such a buffer covers about 1
	  minute. Only when the buffer is full does audio start to play.
	  For MP3 files streamed from a server, that is usually not a big deal as long as
	  the connection to the server is fast enough to supply that much data within a
	  second or two. For MP3 live streams however, it takes 1 minute to download 1
	  minute of audio, so without this change, app_mp3 wasn't really usable for MP3
	  live streams.
	  This commit changes the buffer size so that it covers 6 seconds of an MP3 file
	  streamed from a server and 0.5 seconds of an MP3 live stream. The latter is
	  identified by the use of a .m3u file extension.

	  app_mp3 so far only supported 8 kHz audio.
	  Now it always runs at the sample rate of the channel.

	* res_pjsip: Default endpoints to the "offline" status.

	  A recent change attempted to optimize startup by not updating contact
	  status. Instead, code responsible for qualifying contacts updates the
	  status as it becomes known. The code even accounts for contacts/AORs
	  that are not set to be qualified.

	  The problem, though, is when there are no contacts associated with an
	  endpoint. A common case is when an endpoint is set to register its
	  contacts but has not done so yet. In this case, prior to registration,
	  the endpoint's device state will appear to be "not in use" and hints
	  associated with that device will appear to be "idle". In actuality, the
	  device state and hint should both appear as "unavailable". The reason
	  for the failure is that the optimization change made all persistent
	  endpoint states set to "unknown".

	  The fix here is to change the hard-coded "unknown" to be "offline"
	  instead. The default state will be offline until the qualifying code
	  determines that the contact is actually online. This way, if there are
	  no contacts at all, then the state stays as offline, and device state
	  and hints appear correctly.

	* res_fax: Fix deadlock setting FAXMODE channel variable.

	  ASTERISK-25980 added the FAXMODE channel variable to res_fax.c.
	  Unfortunately, it also introduced a deadlock potential because
	  set_channel_variables() which sets FAXMODE can be called during a
	  masquerade.  The ast_channel_get_t38_state() which gets the value used to
	  set FAXMODE cannot be called with the channel locked.  As a result, local
	  channels can deadlock because of how they must acquire the locks necessary
	  to operate.

	  The intent of FAXMODE is for dialplan to know how a fax was transferred
	  after the fax completes.  However, the previous patch sets FAXMODE to the
	  channel's current T.38 state AFTER the fax has completed and where T.38
	  may have already disconnected.

	  fax_gateway_indicate_t38() calls ast_indicate_data() which cannot be
	  called with any channel locks already held.  A deadlock can happen if the
	  function is operating on a local channel.

	  * Made fax_gateway_indicate_t38() unlock the channel before calling
	  ast_indicate_data() since fax_gateway_indicate_t38() is always called with
	  the channel locked.

	  * Made fax_gateway_indicate_t38() return void since nothing cared about
	  its return value.

	* chan_iax2: Set plaintext auth to deprecated as per ASTERISK-22820

	  Starting from draft 2 of RFC 5456 (October 23, 2006) plaintext auth
	  is not supported in IAX2 protocol. Please refer to section 8.6.13 of
	  RFC 5456.

	  But plaintext auth is still supported by Asterisk implementation of IAX2.
	  This support should be dropped.

	  Patch, based on asterisk-dev discussion, adds deprecation warning on
	  startup if 'auth' is set to 'plaintext', changes default values of
	  'auth' from 'md5, plaintext' to 'md5'.

	  Patch is safe in terms of backwards compatibility, will work even if
	  remote peers have auth=plaintext and we have defaults.

	  auth=plaintext setting will remain deprecated in Asterisk 14 and 15,
	  and IAX2 plaintext support will be removed in Asterisk 16.

	* ConfBridge: Rework announcer channel methodology

	  NOTE: This patch was submitted earlier and reverted because of a failing
	  test. The test has been patched so that it adjusts for the changes here,
	  so this is being resubmitted for review.

	  One feature that confbridge has is the ability to play sounds to all
	  participants in the conference. Prior to this commit, the algorithm for
	  this was as follows:

	  * Grab the playback lock
	  * Push the conference announcer channel into the bridge
	  * Play back the sound
	  * Pull the conference announcer channel from the bridge
	  * Release the playback lock

	  The issue here is that the act of adding the playback channel to the
	  bridge and removing it for each announcement is expensive. Amongst the
	  expenses:

	  * The announcer channel is imparted into the bridge, meaning a new
	    thread is spun up for each playback.
	  * When the announcer is added or removed from the bridge, it results
	    in the BRIDGEPEER channel variable being set on all channels in the
	    bridge. This requires keeping the bridge locked and locking each
	    individual channel in order to set it.
	  * There's also just the general overhead of adding the channel and
	    removing it from the bridge. The bridge potentially has to reconfigure
	    every single time

	  With this commit, the paradigm for playing back announcements has
	  shifted.

	  * The announcer channel is now added to the bridge when the conference
	    is allocated, and it is hung up when the conference is destroyed.
	  * A taskprocessor is used to queue playbacks onto the announcer channel.
	    This keeps the behavior from before where playbacks do not overlap.
	  * The announcer channel is no longer placed into the bridge as
	    departable. Since we are not constantly removing the channel from
	    the bridge, it is safe to add the channel using an independent thread
	    and simply hang the channel up when it is time for the conference to
	    be destroyed.

	  The use of the taskprocessor for playbacks opens up the interesting
	  possibility of having asynchronous announcements played. In this commit,
	  however, the behavior is still exactly the same as it previously was.

	* pjproject_bundled: Allow IPv4/IPv6 (Dual Stack) configurations.

	  PJProject supports a lot of platforms even Windows, some with different defaults
	  when it comes to IPv6. In many Linux platforms like Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
	  "/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only" is set to 0 (false). Different than in Windows.

	  Because of this, if configured with just an IPv6 address/transport, PJProject
	  listens to both IPv4 and IPv6. However, this is not supported by the PJProject
	  team. As consequence, you end-up with IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in SDP,
	  incompatible with IPv4-only clients. Technically, you end-up with an IPv6-only
	  server which accepts incoming connections on IPv4.

	  If you try to configure two transports, one with IPv4 and one with IPv6 on the
	  same interface, as expected by the PJProject team, the IPv4 transport is not
	  able to bind because the IPv6 transport listens to both already.

	  One solution would be to change "/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only" system-wide.
	  Then, you are able to configure two transports, one for each IP version on the
	  same interface. That way, you get a server which works with IPv4 clients and
	  IPv6 clients at the same time over the same interface.

	  Here, this change sets this parameter directly within PJProject to match the
	  expectations of the PJProject team in any case. This allows IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack
	  servers out of the box like in chan_sip. This change was accepted by the
	  PJProject team as <http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/changeset/5403> and is expected
	  to arrive in the next version, PJProject 2.6.0. Until then, this change is
	  incorporated in the bundled PJProject of Asterisk.

	* sip.conf: tlsclientmethod is using sslv23 as default.

	  When 'tlsclientmethod' is not specified in sip.conf, chan_sip uses the OpenSSL
	  SSLv23_method. This was documented incorrectly in the file sip.conf.sample.

	  SSLv23_method got its name in the 90s. Today, with OpenSSL 1.0.2, this method
	  enables (just) the secure TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.2. Or stated differently, that
	  function should have been called 'secure_method' or 'automatic_method' back in
	  the 90s.

	  Consequently please, specify 'tlsclientmethod=tlsv1' in your sip.conf only if
	  you face a server which has problems like not falling back to TLSv1.0
	  automatically.

	* res_format_attr_g729: Add annexb=no format parameter to SDPs

	  Historically, Asterisk has always specified annexb=no for the g729 format.
	  However, when using res_pjsip no format attribute was specified. This patch
	  makes it so the SDP now contains a format attribute line with annexb=no.

	  Note, that this means only g729a is negotiated. Even for pass through support.
	  According to rfc7261 the type of annex used (a or b) is dependent upon the
	  answerer. However, Asterisk being a back to back user agent makes this tricky
	  to support at this time, thus we only allow annex 'a' for now.

	* res_pjsip_session.c: Fix unbound srv failover tests.

	  Commit 1b666549f33d69dc080b212bf92126f3bc3a18b2 broke the srv failover
	  functionality if a TCP connection gets disconnected.  Under these
	  conditions, session_inv_on_state_changed() gets a
	  PJSIP_EVENT_TRANSPORT_ERROR and restarts the INVITE transaction on a new
	  transport.  Unfortunately, session_inv_on_tsx_state_changed() also gets
	  the same PJSIP_EVENT_TRANSPORT_ERROR event and unconditionally terminates
	  the session.

	  * Made session_inv_on_tsx_state_changed() complete terminating the session
	  on PJSIP_EVENT_TRANSPORT_ERROR only if the session state is still
	  PJSIP_INV_STATE_DISCONNECTED.

	  automatic logic that sets sname to name if there's no compact form of
	  the header, which there isn't for PAI and RPID.  So now we force sname
	  to be the same as name right after we set name.

	* pjsip: Fix deadlock with suspend taskprocessor on masquerade

	  If both channels which should be masqueraded
	  are in the same serializer:
	  1st channel will be locked waiting condition 'complete'
	  2nd channel will be locked waiting condition 'suspended'

	  On heavy load system a chance that both channels will be in
	  the same serializer 'pjsip/distibutor' is very high.

	  To reproduce compile res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c with
	  DISTRIBUTOR_POOL_SIZE=1

	  Steps to reproduce:
	  1. Party A calls Party B (bridged call 'AB')
	  2. Party B places Party A on hold
	  3. Party B calls Voicemail app (non-bridged call 'BV')
	  4. Party B attended transfers Party A to voicemail using REFER.
	  5. When asterisk masquerades calls 'AB' and 'BV',
	     a deadlock is happened.

	  This patch adds a suspension indicator to the taskprocessor.
	  When a session suspends/unsuspends the serializer
	  it sets the indicator to the appropriate state.
	  The session checks the suspension indicator before
	  suspend the serializer.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Cache local RTCP address.

	  When an RTCP packet is sent or received, res_rtp_asterisk generates a
	  Stasis event that contains the RTCP report as well as the local and
	  remote addresses that the report pertains to.

	  The addresses are determined using ast_find_ourip(). For the local
	  address, this will typically result in a lookup of the hostname of the
	  server, and then a DNS lookup of that hostname. If you do not have the
	  host in /etc/hosts, then this results in a full DNS lookup, which can
	  potentially block for some time.

	  This is especially problematic when performing RTCP reads, since those
	  are done on the same thread responsible for reading and writing media.

	  This patch addresses the issue by performing a lookup of the local
	  address when RTCP is allocated. We then use this cached local address
	  for the Stasis events when necessary.

	* res_pjsip_mwi: fix unsolicited mwi blocks PJSIP stack

	  The PJSIP taskprocessors could be overflowed on startup
	  if there are many (thousands) realtime endpoints
	  configured with unsolicited mwi.
	  The PJSIP stack could be totally unresponsive for a few minutes
	  after boot completed.

	  This patch creates a separate PJSIP serializers pool for mwi
	  and makes unsolicited mwi use serializers from this pool.
	  This patch also adds 2 new global options to tune taskprocessor
	  alert levels: 'mwi_tps_queue_high' and 'mwi_tps_queue_low'.

	  This patch also adds new global option 'mwi_disable_initial_unsolicited'
	  to disable sending unsolicited mwi to all endpoints on startup.
	  If disabled then unsolicited mwi will start processing
	  on next endpoint's contact update.

	* app_voicemail: Add taskprocessor alert level options.

	  On heavy loaded system with IMAP or DB storage,
	  'app_voicemail' taskprocessor queue could reach 500 scheduled tasks.
	  It could happen when the IMAP or DB server dies or is unreachable.
	  It could happen on startup when there are many (thousands)
	  realtime endpoints configured with unsolicited mwi.
	  If the taskprocessor queue reaches the high water level
	  then the alert is triggered and pjsip stops processing new requests
	  until the queue reaches the low water level to clear the alert.

	  This patch adds 2 new 'general' configuration options
	  to tune taskprocessor alert levels:
	  'tps_queue_high' - Taskprocessor high water alert trigger level.
	  'tps_queue_low' - Taskprocessor low water clear alert level

	* Remove SILK payload mappings from Asterisk core.

	  SILK is a bit of a hog when it comes to using up our limited number of
	  dynamic payload types in the RTP engine. By freeing up four slots, it
	  allows for other codecs to potentially take the place.

	  Now, codec_silk.so will dynamically use the payload slots in the RTP
	  engine when it loads.

	  A better fix would be make RTP dynamic payload types actually
	  dynamic. However, at this stage of Asterisk 14 development, this is a
	  risky move that would be imprudent.

	* pbx.c: Fix handling of '-' in extension name and callerid

	  This adds a two strings to ast_exten.  name to go with exten and
	  cidmatch_display to go with cidmatch.  The new fields contain input used
	  to add the extension in the first place.  The existing fields now
	  contain stripped input that excludes insignificant spaces and dashes.
	  These stripped fields should always be used for comparisons.  The
	  unstripped fields should normally be used for display, but displaying
	  stripped values will not cause runtime errors.

	  Note the actual string is only stored twice if it contains dashes.  If
	  no dashes are found then both 'char *' fields point to the same memory.
	  So this change has a minimum effect on memory usage.

	  The existing functions ast_get_extension_name and
	  ast_get_extension_cidmatch return unstripped values as they did before
	  this change.  Other similar bugs likely still exist where unstripped
	  extensions are saved outside pbx.c then passed back in.

	  This patch removed call of pjsip_tx_data_dec_ref in send_notify
	  if send_request failed.
	  The pjsip_dlg_send_request deletes the message on error by itself.

	  It seems this patch fixes next issues:

	* res_pjsip: Do not crash on ACKs from unknown endpoints.

	  The endpoint identification PJSIP module is intended to identify which
	  endpoint an incoming request is from. If an endpoint is not identified,
	  then an artificial endpoint is used in its place when proceeding.

	  The problem is that the ACK request type is an exception to the rule.
	  The artificial endpoint is not used when processing an ACK. This results
	  in the possibility of having a NULL endpoint being used further on.

	  The reason ACK is an exception is an attempt not to spam security logs
	  with unidentified requests. Presumably, you've already logged the
	  unidentified request on the preceeding INVITE.

	  Up until Asterisk 13.10, retrieving a NULL endpoint in this fashion
	  didn't cause an issue. A new change in 13.10 added endpoint ACL checking
	  shortly after endpoint identification. Because we are accessing a NULL
	  endpoint, this ACL check resulted in a crash.

	  The fix here is to be sure to retrieve the artificial endpoint for all
	  request types. ACKs still do not generate unidentified request security
	  events.

	* res/res_stasis_playback: Cancel the entire playlist when a stop occurs

	  Prior to this patch, a stop issued by a delete of a Playback resource
	  (indicated by the control frame AST_CONTROL_STREAM_STOP) would only stop
	  the current media URI playing. Subsequent URIs specified by a playback
	  operation would then proceed on, even though we had just indicated to
	  the User that the Playback was finished *and* after they had just
	  'deleted' the resource. Whoops.

	  This patch corrects it by bailing out of the sequence of URIs to play if
	  one of them is terminated with an AST_CONTROL_STREAM_STOP indication.

	* res_pjsip_caller_id:  Copy header name to short header name

	  When compact_headers was set, we were sending a zero-length header name
	  for PAI and RPID because we always forced the short header name length
	  to 0.  We did this because we cloned the header from "From" and wanted
	  to clear "f" from the sname.  By cloning however, we bypass pjproject's
	  automatic logic that sets sname to name if there's no compact form of
	  the header, which there isn't for PAI and RPID.  So now we force sname
	  to be the same as name right after we set name.

	  res_pjsip_diversion needed the same treatment for the Diversion header.

	* res_srtp: Move SDP SRTP code from the core to res_srtp.

	  A patch made to the master branch (Now the 14 branch) inadvertently made
	  libsrtp a required dependency in order to compile Asterisk.  Rather than
	  create dummy defines to substitute for the defines supplied by libsrtp
	  when libsrtp is not available, most of the code in sdp_srtp.c is moved
	  into res_srtp.c.  This gets more code out of Asterisk's core that isn't

	* Remove SILK payload mappings from Asterisk core.

	  SILK is a bit of a hog when it comes to using up our limited number of
	  dynamic payload types in the RTP engine. By freeing up four slots, it
	  allows for other codecs to potentially take the place.

	  Now, codec_silk.so will dynamically use the payload slots in the RTP
	  engine when it loads.

	  A better fix would be make RTP dynamic payload types actually
	  dynamic. However, at this stage of Asterisk 14 development, this is a
	  risky move that would be imprudent.

	* Update support for SILK format.

	  This commit adds scaffolding in order to support the SILK audio format
	  on calls. Roughly, this is what is added:

	  * Cached silk formats. One for each possible sample rate.
	  * ast_codec structures for each possible sample rate.
	  * RTP payload mappings for "SILK".

	  In addition, this change overhauls the res_format_attr_silk file in the
	  following ways:

	  * The "samplerate" attribute is scrapped. That's native to the format.
	  * There are far more checks to ensure that attributes have been
	    allocated before attempting to reference them.
	  * We do not SDP fmtp lines for attributes set to 0.

	  These changes make way to be able to install a codec_silk module and
	  have it actually work. It also should allow for passthrough silk calls
	  in Asterisk.

	* app_queue: Only remove queue member from pending when state changes.

	  It is possible for a not in use state change to occur multiple
	  times causing a queue member to be removed from the pending call
	  container prematurely.

	  The first not in use state change will remove the queue member
	  from the container. At this moment the member may be called and
	  placed in the pending container. After this another not in use
	  state change can be received which will remove it from the
	  container. Despite being called at this point the code will
	  incorrectly see that there are no pending calls to it.

	  This change only removes it from the pending container if the
	  state has actually changed.

	* translate: explicit format destination not properly set

	  If the destination format's name differed from the codec name then the
	  translator's explict_dst field would be improperly set. In some circumstances
	  it would end up setting it to a newly created format that has the same name
	  as the codec when it actually needed to be the given destination codec.

	  This could cause the translation path to use the wrong format. For instance,
	  if an endpoint had specified 'myulaw' as a format the translator could end up
	  using a 'ulaw' format (with whatever/default settings) instead. If the format
	  attribute settings differed between the two then there may unexpected results
	  during processing.

	  This patch removes the name check when building the translation path. This
	  should make it always set the translator's explicit_dst to the given destination
	  format as long as the sample rate and types match.

	* res/res_pjsip_session: Check for presence of an active negotiator

	  It is possible in a hypothetical situation for a session refresh to be
	  invoked on a PJSIP when the negotiatior on the INVITE session has not
	  yet been established. While this shouldn't occur with existing uses of
	  ast_sip_session_refresh, the crashes that occur due to improperly
	  calling PJSIP functions that expect a non-NULL negotiatior are
	  avoidable. PJSIP will create the negotiator in pjsip_inv_reinvite; this
	  means that simply checking for the presence of the negotiator before
	  passing it to other PJSIP functions that use it is allowable. As such,
	  this patch adds checks for the presence of the negotiator before calling
	  PJSIP functions that assume it is non-NULL.

	* res/res_corosync: Raise a Stasis message on node join/leave events

	  When res_corosync detects that a node leaves or joins, it currently is
	  informed of this via Corosync callbacks. However, there are a few
	  limitations with the information presented:
	  (1) While we have information that Corosync is aware of - such as the
	      Corosync nodeid - that information is really only useful inside of
	      Corosync or res_corosync. There's no way to translate a Corosync
	      nodeid to some other internally useful unique identifier for the
	      Asterisk instance that just joined or left the cluster.
	  (2) While res_corosync is notified of the instance joining or leaving
	      the cluster, it has no mechanism to inform the Asterisk core or
	      other modules of this event. This limits the usefulness of res_corosync
	      as a heartbeat mechanism for other modules.

	  This patch addresses both issues.

	  First, it adds the notion of a cluster discovery message both within the
	  Stasis message bus, as well as the binary event messages that
	  res_corosync uses to transmit data back and forth within the cluster.
	  When Asterisk joins the cluster, it sends a discovery message to the other
	  nodes in the cluster, which correlates the Corosync nodeid along with
	  the Asterisk EID. res_corosync now maintains a hash of Corosync nodeids
	  to Asterisk EIDs, such that it can map changes in cluster state with the
	  Asterisk instance that has that nodeid. Likewise, when an Asterisk
	  instance receives a discovery message from a node in the cluster, it now
	  sends its own discovery message back to the originating node with the
	  local Asterisk EID. This lets Asterisk instances within the cluster
	  build a complete picture of the other Asterisk instances within the
	  cluster.

	  Second, it publishes the discovery messages onto the Stasis message bus.
	  Said messages are published whenever a node joins or leaves the cluster.
	  Interested modules can subscribe for the ast_cluster_discovery_type()
	  message under the ast_system_topic() and be notified when changes in
	  cluster state occur.

	* rest_api/channels:  Fix multiple issues with create and dial

	  * We weren't properly subscribing to the channel and it's originator
	    on create.
	  * We weren't doing a publish_dial after calling ast_call on dial.
	  * We weren't calling depart_bridge when a channel left the dial bridge.

	  The first 2 issues were causing events to not be generated and the third
	  was actually causing channels to not get properly destroyed when hung up.

	  Together these 3 issues were causing the new
	  rest_apichannels/create_dial_bridge tests to fail.

	  As a result of the fixes, the cdr state machine had to be slightly
	  tweaked to allow bridge leave events without asserting and the tests
	  themselves had to be updated to account for the channels now cleaning
	  themselves up.

	* res_pjsip: Fix statsd regression.

	  The ASTERISK-25904 change-id I8fad8aae9305481469c38d2146e1ba3a56d3108f
	  patch introduced several regressions when the newly created "Updated"
	  state goes out for each endpoint registration refresh.

	  1) It restarted any OPTIONS RTT ping cycle.

	  2) It would interfere with a currently active ping and throw off that
	  ping's resulting RTT calculation.

	  3) It cleared the RTT time each time the endpoint was refreshed.

	  4) The cleared RTT time was sent out as a statsd update each time.

	  5) It created two AMI events for each update.

	  * Revert the original patch and reimplement it.  Now the current contact
	  status state is re-sent instead of the state being momentarily toggled
	  every time the endpoint refreshes its registration.  The statsd events are
	  not created for the re-sent refresh because they are sent after every
	  OPTIONS ping.

	* func_odbc: Fix connection deadlock.

	  The func_odbc module was modified to ensure that the
	  previous behavior of using a single database connection
	  was maintained. This was done by getting a single database
	  connection and holding on to it. With the new multiple
	  connection support in res_odbc this will actually starve
	  every other thread from getting access to the database as
	  it also maintains the previous behavior of having only
	  a single database connection.

	  This change disables the func_odbc specific behavior if
	  the res_odbc module is running with only a single database
	  connection active. The connection is only kept for the
	  duration of the request.

	* res_sorcery_realtime: fix bug when successful UPDATE is treated as failed

	  If the SQL UPDATE statement changes nothing then SQLRowCount returns 0.
	  This value should be treated as success.
	  But the function sorcery_realtime_update treats it as failed.

	  This bug was found using stress tests on PJSIP.
	  If there are 2 consecutive SIP REGISTER requests with the same contact data
	  during 1 second then res_pjsip_registrar adds contact location on 1st request
	  and tries to update contact location on 2nd.
	  The update fails and res_pjsip_registrar even removes correct contact location.

	  The test "object_update_uncreated" was removed from test_sorcery_realtime.c
	  because it's now a valid situation.

	  This patch also adds missing debug of extra SQL parameter.

	* chan_sip/res_pjsip_t38: Handle a request to negotiate T.38 after it is enabled.

	  Some T.38 implementations may send another re-invite after the initial

	  Currently this will fail when passthrough is being done in chan_sip as we
	  do nothing if T.38 is already active.

	  Other handlers of T.38 inside of Asterisk (such as res_fax) handle this
	  scenario so this change adds support for it to chan_sip and res_pjsip_t38.
	  If a request to negotiate is received while T.38 is already enabled a
	  new re-INVITE is sent and negotiation is done again.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Address SEGV when attempting to terminate a subscription

	  Occasionally under load we'll attempt to send a final NOTIFY on a
	  subscription that's already been terminated and a SEGV will occur
	  down in pjproject's evsub_destroy function.  This is a result of a
	  race condition between all the paths that can generate a notify
	  and/or destroy the underlying pjproject evsub object:

	   * The client can send a SUBSCRIBE with Expires: 0.
	   * The client can send a SUBSCRIBE/refresh.
	   * The subscription timer can expire.
	   * An extension state can change.
	   * An MWI event can be generated.
	   * The pjproject transaction timer (timer_b) can expire.

	  Normally when our pubsub_on_evsub_state is called with a terminate,
	  we push a task to the serializer and return at which point the dialog
	  is unlocked.  This is usually not a problem because the task runs
	  immediately and locks the dialog again.  When the system is heavily
	  loaded though, there may be a delay between the unlock and relock
	  during which another event may occur such as the subscription timer
	  or timer_b expiring, an extension state change, etc.  These may also
	  cause a terminate to be processed and if so, we could cause pjproject
	  to try to destroy the evsub structure twice.  There's no way for us to
	  tell that the evsub was already destroyed and the evsub's group lock
	  can't tolerate this and SEGVs.

	  The remedy is twofold.

	   * A patch has been submitted to Teluu and added to the bundled
	     pjproject which adds add/decrement operations on evsub's group lock.

	   * In res_pjsip_pubsub:
	     * configure.ac and pjproject-bundled's configure.m4 were updated
	       to check for the new evsub group lock APIs.
	     * We now add a reference to the evsub group lock when we create
	       the subscription and remove the reference when we clean up the
	       subscription.  This prevents evsub from being destroyed before
	       we're done with it.
	     * A state has been added to the subscription tree structure so
	       termination progress can be tracked through the asyncronous tasks.
	     * The pubsub_on_evsub_state callback has been split so it's not doing
	       double duty.  It now only handles the final cleanup of the
	       subscription tree.  pubsub_on_rx_refresh now handles both client
	       refreshes and client terminates.  It was always being called for
	       both anyway.
	     * The serialized_on_server_timeout task was removed since
	       serialized_pubsub_on_rx_refresh was almost identical.
	     * Missing state checks and ao2_cleanups were added.
	     * Some debug levels were adjusted to make seeing only off-nominal
	       things at level 1 and nominal or progress things at level 2+.

	* res_pjsip_session: Handle race condition at shutdown with timer.

	  When shutting down res_pjsip_session will get unloaded before res_pjsip.
	  The act of unloading unregisters all the PJSIP services and sets
	  their module IDs to -1. In some cases it is possible for a timer to
	  occur after this happens which calls into res_pjsip_session. The
	  res_pjsip_session module can then try to get the session from the
	  INVITE session using the module ID. Since the module ID is now -1
	  this fails.

	  This change stores a copy of the module ID and uses it for the timer
	  callback scenario. If the module ID is -1 the callback immediately
	  returns but if the module ID is valid then it continues as normal.

	  This works as the original ID of the module is guaranteed to still
	  be valid when used with the INVITE session.

	* ARI: Ensure announcer channels are destroyed.

	  Announcer channels were not being destroyed because the
	  stasis_app_control structure that referenced them was not being
	  destroyed. The control structure was not being destroyed because it was
	  not being unlinked from its container. It was not being unlinked from
	  its container because the after bridge callback for the announcer
	  channel was not being run. The after bridge callback was not being run
	  because the after bridge datastore was not being removed from the
	  channel on destruction. The channel was not being destroyed because the
	  hangup that used to destroy the channel was now only reducing the
	  reference count to one. The reference count of the channel was only
	  being reduced to one because the stasis_app_control structure was
	  holding the final reference...

	  The control structure used to not keep a reference to the channel, so
	  that loop described above did not happen.

	  The solution is to manually remove the control structure from its
	  container when the playback on a bridge is complete.

	* cel: Ensure only one dial status per channel exists.

	  CEL wrongly assumed that a channel would only have a single dial
	  event on it. This is incorrect. Particularly in a queue each
	  call attempt to a member will result in a dial event, adding
	  a new dial status in CEL without removing the old one. This
	  would cause the container to grow with only one dial status
	  being removed when the channel went away. The other dial status
	  entries would remain leaking memory.

	  This change fixes the memory leak by ensuring that only one dial
	  status will only ever exist for each channel.

	  The behavior during the scenario where multiple events are received
	  has also been improved. For failure cases the first failure will
	  be the dial status. If an answer dial status is received, though,
	  it will take priority and the dial status for the channel will be
	  answer.

	  Memory usage has also been decreased by storing the minimal
	  amount of information and the code has been cleaned up slightly.

	* ARI: Ensure proper channel state on operations.

	  have not yet answered. If a channel is in an invalid state, we will send

	* test_http_media_cache: Fix failing test.

	  The retrieve_cache_control_directives test has been failing occasionally
	  in Jenkins. The apparent failure occurs when attempting to validate the
	  expiration of the retrieved file.

	  After reproducing, the problem was pretty clear. At the beginning of the
	  test, the current time is retrieved. The seconds value of this timestamp
	  is X. When the file is retrieved, res_http_media_cache calculates the
	  expiration and in doing so retrieves the current time. In most cases,
	  since the test executes quickly, it will also retrieve a timestamp with
	  X seconds. However, if the test starts very near to when the timestamp
	  seconds are set to increment, res_http_media_cache may retrieve a
	  timestamp with X+1 seconds instead.

	  The test attempted to account for this by allowing a tolerance of 1
	  second when validating the expiration. However, the problem was that the
	  comparisons being used in the validation used > and < operations. This
	  meant that values that fell within the tolerance (because they equaled
	  the upper bound of the tolerance) would fail.

	  The solution is to use >= and <= operators in the expiration validation.

	  However, I estimated that while the one second tolerance should be
	  fine on most machines, it would still be possible on a very slow machine
	  to end up falling outside the one second tolerance. So I have also
	  relaxed the tolerance of expiration validation to be three seconds
	  instead.

	  The final change here is to add a debug message when validating
	  expiration so that we can see what values are being compared.

	* chan_pjsip: Lock channel when checking for RTP changes.

	  bridge_native_rtp can call into an RTP-capable channel driver in order
	  for the driver to update information about who the channel is
	  communicating with. For SIP channel drivers, this means deactivating
	  RTCP and sending a reinvite so that the endpoints can communicate
	  directly.

	  bridge_native_rtp does the right thing and has the channel locked when
	  calling into the channel driver. chan_pjsip can't alter session
	  properties in this thread, though. chan_pjsip queues a task on the
	  session serializer in order to update properties there.

	  The problem is that this queued task was not locking the channel. This
	  meant that the queued task could attempt to deactivate RTCP at the same
	  time that the channel thread was attempting to process an incoming RTCP
	  packet. This could lead to a crash.

	  This patch fixes the issue by locking the channel in the queued task
	  when altering RTP properties.

	* res_pjsip_registrar.c: Eliminate rx REGISTER request race condition.

	  This patch fixes a race condition processing received REGISTER requests
	  and their retransmissions caused by REGISTER requests being processed by
	  two threads.  The "sip_transaction Unable to register REGISTER transaction
	  (key exists)" message is a notable symptom of this issue.

	  This issue was more likely to happen before the pjsip/distributor
	  serializers were created.  Instead of steps one and two below placing the
	  REGISTER messages into the same pjsip/distributor they were placed in
	  random pjsip/default serializers.

	  1) REGISTER requests come in and get placed on the pjsip/distributor
	  serializer.

	  2) Before the first request is processed a retransmission comes in and is
	  placed on the same pjsip/distributor serializer.

	  3) The first request goes up the pjsip stack and is then shunted off to
	  the pjsip/aor/<aor> serializer.

	  4) Before the first request is completed processing in the pjsip/aor/<aor>
	  serializer, the second request goes up the pjsip stack and is also shunted
	  off to the pjsip/aor/<aor> serializer.

	  5) The first request completes processing and sends out its response.

	  6) The second request completes processing and tries to send out its
	  response but pjlib complains that the REGISTER transaction key already
	  exists.

	  7) Sadness ensues.

	  * The race is eliminated by removing the pjsip/aor/<aor> serializer and
	  continuing the processing in the pjsip/distributor serializer.  Now any
	  retransmissions queued in the pjsip/distributor serializer will be
	  processed after the first message is completely processed.

	* stasis: Add setting subscription congestion levels.

	  Stasis subscriptions and message routers create taskprocessors to process
	  the event messages.  API calls are needed to be able to set the congestion
	  levels of these taskprocessors for selected subscriptions and message
	  routers.

	  * Updated CDR, CEL, and manager's stasis subscription congestion levels
	  based upon stress testing.  Increased the congestion levels to reduce the
	  potential for bursty call setup/teardown activity from triggering the
	  taskprocessor overload alert.  CDRs in particular need an extra high
	  congestion level because they can take awhile to process the stasis
	  messages.

	* taskprocessors: Implement high/low water mark alerts.

	  When taskprocessors get backed up, there is a good chance that we are
	  being overloaded and need to defer adding new work to the system.

	  * Implemented a high/low water alert mechanism for modules to check if the
	  system is being overloaded and take appropriate action.  When a
	  taskprocessor is created it has default congestion levels set.  A
	  taskprocessor can later have those congestion levels altered for specific
	  needs if stress testing shows that the taskprocessor is a symptom of
	  overloading or needs to handle bursty activity without triggering an
	  overload alert.

	  * Add CLI "core show taskprocessor" low/high water columns.

	  * Fixed __allocate_taskprocessor() to not use RAII_VAR().  RAII_VAR() was
	  never a good thing to use when creating a taskprocessor because of the
	  nature of how its references needed to be cleaned up on a partial
	  creation.

	  * Made res_pjsip's distributor check if the taskprocessor overload alert
	  is active before placing a message representing brand new work onto a
	  distributor serializer.

	* res_hep_{pjsip|rtcp}: Decline module loads if res_hep had not loaded

	  A crash can occur in res_hep_pjsip or res_hep_rtcp if res_hep has not
	  loaded and does not have a configuration file. Previously when this
	  occurred, checks were put in to see if the configuration was loaded
	  successfully. While this is a good idea - and has been added to the
	  offending function in res_hep - the reality is res_hep_pjsip and
	  res_hep_rtcp have no business running if res_hep isn't also running.

	  As such, this patch also adds a function to res_hep that returns whether
	  or not it successfully loaded. Oddly enough, ast_module_check returns
	  "everything is peachy" even if a module declined its load - so it cannot
	  be solely relied on. res_hep_pjsip and res_hep_rtcp now also check this
	  function to see if they should continue to load; if it fails, they
	  decline their load as well.

	* res_odbc: Implement a connection pool.

	  Testing has shown that our usage of UnixODBC is problematic
	  due to bugs within UnixODBC itself as well as the heavy weight
	  cost of connecting and disconnecting database connections, even
	  when pooling is enabled.

	  For users of UnixODBC 2.3.1 and earlier crashes would occur due
	  to insufficient protection of the disconnect operation. This was
	  fixed in UnixODBC 2.3.2 and above.

	  For users of UnixODBC 2.3.3 and higher a slow-down would occur
	  under heavy database use due to repeated connection establishment.
	  A regression is present where on each connection the database
	  configuration is cached again, with the cache growing out of
	  control.

	  The connection pool implementation present in this change helps
	  to mitigate these issues by reducing how much we connect and
	  disconnect database connections. We also solve the issue of
	  crashes under UnixODBC 2.3.1 by defaulting the maximum number of
	  connections to 1, returning us to the previous working behavior.
	  For users who may have a fixed version the maximum concurrent
	  connection limit can be increased helping with performance.

	  The connection pool works by keeping a list of active connections.
	  If the connection limit has not been reached a new connection is
	  established. If the connection limit has been reached then the
	  request waits until a connection becomes available before
	  continuing.

	* ari/resource_channels:  Add 'formats' to channel create/originate

	  If you create a local channel and don't specify an originator channel
	  to take capabilities from, we automatically add all audio formats to
	  the new channel's capabilities. When we try to make the channel
	  compatible with another, the "best format" functions pick the best
	  format available, which in this case will be slin192.  While this is
	  great for preserving quality, it's the worst for performance and
	  overkill for the vast majority of applications.

	  In the absense of any other information, adding all formats is the
	  correct thing to do and it's not always possible to supply an
	  originator so a new parameter 'formats' has been added to the channel
	  create/originate functions. It's just a comma separated list of formats
	  to make availalble for the channel. Example: "ulaw,slin,slin16".
	  'formats' and 'originator' are mutually exclusive.

	  To facilitate determination of format names, the format name has been
	  added to "core show codecs".

	* Expand the scope of Dial Events

	  Dial events up to this point have come in two flavors
	  * A Dial event with no status to indicate that dialing has begun
	  * A Dial event with a status to indicate that dialing has ended

	  With this change, Dial events have been expanded to also give
	  intermediate events, such as "RINGING", "PROCEEDING", and "PROGRESS".
	  This is especially useful for ARI dialing, as it gives the application
	  writer the opportunity to place a channel into an early bridge when
	  early media is detected.

	  AMI handles these in-progress dial events by sending a new event called
	  "DialState" that simply indicates that dial state has changed but has
	  not ended. ARI never distinguished between DialBegin and DialEnd, so no
	  change was made to the event itself.

	  Another change here relates to dial forwards. A forward-related event
	  was previously only sent when a channel was successfully able to forward
	  a call to a new channel. With this set of changes, if forwarding is
	  blocked, we send a Dial event with a forwarding destination but no
	  forwarding channel, since we were prevented from creating one. This is
	  again useful for ARI since application writers can now handle call
	  forward attempts from within their own application.

	* ARI: Re-implement the ARI dial command, allowing for early bridging.

	  ARI dial had been implemented using the Dial API. This made great sense
	  when dialing was 100% separate from bridging. However, if a channel were
	  to be added to a bridge during the dial attempt, there would be a
	  conflict between the dialing thread and the bridging thread. Each would
	  be attempting to read frames from the dialed channel and act on them.

	  The initial attempt to make the two play nice was to have the Dial API
	  suspend the channel in the bridge and stay in charge of the channel
	  until the dial was complete. The problem with this was that it was
	  riddled with potential race conditions. It also was not well-suited for
	  the case where the channel changed which bridge it was in during the
	  dial.

	  This new approach removes the use of the Dial API altogether. Instead,
	  the channel we are dialing is placed into an invisible ARI dialing
	  bridge. The bridge channel thread handles incoming frames from the
	  channel. If the channel is added to a real bridge, it is departed from
	  the invisible bridge and then added to the real bridge. Similarly, if
	  the channel is removed from the real bridge, it is automatically added
	  back to the invisible bridge if the dial attempt is still active.

	  This approach keeps the threading simple by always having the channel
	  being handled by bridge channel threads.

	* res_pjsip: Match dialogs on responses better.

	  When receiving an incoming response to a dialog-starting INVITE, we were
	  not matching the response to the INVITE dialog. Since we had not
	  recorded the to-tag to the dialog structure, the PJSIP-provided method
	  to find the dialog did not match.

	  Most of the time, this was not a problem, because there is a fall-back
	  that makes the response get routed to the same serializer that the
	  request was sent on. However, in cases where an asynchronous DNS lookup
	  occurs in the PJSIP core, the thread that sends the INVITE is not
	  actually a threadpool serializer thread. This means we are unable to
	  record a serializer to handle the incoming response.

	  Now, imagine what happens when an INVITE is sent on a non-serialized
	  thread, and an error response (such as a 486) arrives. The 486 ends up
	  getting put on some random threadpool thread. Eventually, a hangup task
	  gets queued on the INVITE dialog serializer. Since the 486 is being
	  handled on a different thread, the hangup task can execute at the same
	  time that the 486 is being handled. The hangup task assumes that it is
	  the sole owner of the INVITE session and channel, so it ends up
	  potentially freeing the channel and NULLing the session's channel
	  pointer. The thread handling the 486 can crash as a result.

	  This change has the incoming response match the INVITE transaction, and
	  then get the dialog from that transaction. It's the same method we had
	  been using for matching incoming CANCEL requests. By doing this, we get
	  the INVITE dialog and can ensure that the 486 response ends up being
	  handled by the same thread as the hangup, ensuring that the hangup runs
	  after the 486 has been completely handled.

	* ARI: Add the ability to play multiple media URIs in a single operation

	  Many ARI applications will want to play multiple media files in a row to
	  a resource. The most common use case is when building long-ish IVR prompts
	  made up of multiple, smaller sound files. Today, that requires building a
	  small state machine, listening for each PlaybackFinished event, and triggering
	  the next sound file to play. While not especially challenging, it is tedious
	  work. Since requiring developers to write tedious code to do normal activities
	  stinks, this patch adds the ability to play back a list of media files to a
	  resource.

	  Each of the 'play' operations on supported resources (channels and bridges)
	  now accepts a comma delineated list of media URIs to play. A single Playback
	  resource is created as a handle to the entire list. The operation of playing
	  a list is identical to playing a single media URI, save that a new event,
	  PlaybackContinuing, is raised instead of a PlaybackFinished for each non-final
	  media URI. When the entire list is finished being played, a PlaybackFinished
	  event is raised.

	  In order to help inform applications where they are in the list playback, the
	  Playback resource now includes a new, optional attribute, 'next_media_uri',
	  that contains the next URI in the list to be played.

	  It's important to note the following:
	   - If an offset is provided to the 'play' operations, it only applies to the
	     first media URI, as it would be weird to skip n seconds forward in every
	     media resource.
	   - Operations that control the position of the media only affect the current
	     media being played. For example, once a media resource in the list
	     completes, a 'reverse' operation on a subsequent media resource will not
	     start a previously completed media resource at the appropiate offset.
	   - This patch does not add any new operations to control the list. Hopefully,
	     user feedback and/or future patches would add that if people want it.

	* res_pjsip:  Set TCP_NODELAY on TCP transports

	  Although it's perfectly legal to place multiple SIP messages in the same packet,

	  dropped.

	  We can't specifically tell the stack to send only 1 message per packet, but we
	  can turn on TCP_NODELAY when we create the transport. This will at least tell
	  the stack to send packets as soon as possible.

	* logger: Support JSON logging with Verbose messages

	  When 2d7a4a3357 was merged, it missed the fact that Verbose log messages
	  are formatted and handled by 'verbosers'. Verbosers are registered
	  functions that handle verbose messages only; they exist as a separate
	  class of callbacks. This was done to handle the 'magic' that must be
	  inserted into Verbose messages sent to remote consoles, so that the
	  consoles can format the messages correctly, i.e., the leading
	  tabs/characters.

	  In reality, verbosers are a weird appendage: they're a separate class of
	  formatters/message handlers outside of what handles all other log
	  messages in Asterisk. After some code inspection, it became clear that
	  simply passing a Verbose message along with its 'sublevel' importance
	  through the normal logging mechanisms removes the need for verbosers
	  altogether.

	  This patch removes the verbosers, and makes the default log formatter
	  aware that, if the log channel is a console log, it should simply insert
	  the 'verbose magic' into the log messages itself. This allows the
	  console handlers to interpret and format the verbose message
	  themselves.

	  This simplifies the code quite a lot, and should improve the performance
	  of printing verbose messages by a reasonable factor:
	  (1) It removes a number of memory allocations that were done on each
	      verobse message
	  (2) It removes the need to strip the verbose magic out of the verbose
	      log messages before passing them to non-console log channels
	  (3) It now performs fewer iterations over lists when handling verbose
	      messages

	  Since verbose messages are now handled like other log messages (for the
	  most part), the JSON formatting of the messages works as well.

	* res/res_hep_pjsip: Fix reported local IP address when bound to 'any'

	  When bound to an 'any' address, e.g., 0.0.0.0, PJSIP reports as its
	  local address the 'any' address, as opposed to the IP address we
	  actually received the packet on. This can cause some confusion in Homer,
	  as it will dutifully report what we send it.

	  This patch uses the PJSIP inspection routines to determine which IP
	  address we probably received the packet on based on the remote party's
	  IP address. In the event that this fails, it falls back to the IP
	  address natively reported by the transport.

	* res_hep: Provide an option to pick the UUID type

	  At one point in time, it seemed like a good idea to use the Asterisk
	  channel name as the HEP correlation UUID. In particular, it felt like
	  this would be a useful identifier to tie PJSIP messages and RTCP
	  messages together, along with whatever other data we may eventually send
	  to Homer. This also had the benefit of keeping the correlation UUID
	  channel technology agnostic.

	  In practice, it isn't as useful as hoped, for two reasons:
	  1) The first INVITE request received doesn't have a channel. As a
	     result, there is always an 'odd message out', leading it to be
	     potentially uncorrelated in Homer.
	  2) Other systems sending capture packets (Kamailio) use the SIP Call-ID.
	     This causes RTCP information to be uncorrelated to the SIP message
	     traffic seen by those capture nodes.

	  In order to support both (in case someone is trying to use res_hep_rtcp
	  with a non-PJSIP channel), this patch adds a new option, uuid_type, with
	  two valid values - 'call-id' and 'channel'. The uuid_type option is used
	  by a module to determine the preferred UUID type. When available, that
	  source of a correlation UUID is used; when not, the more readily available
	  source is used.

	  For res_hep_pjsip:
	   - uuid_type = call-id: the module uses the SIP Call-ID header value
	   - uuid_type = channel: the module uses the channel name if available,
	                          falling back to SIP Call-ID if not
	  For res_hep_rtcp:
	   - uuid_type = call-id: the module uses the SIP Call-ID header if the
	                          channel type is PJSIP and we have a channel,
	                          falling back to the Stasis event provided
	                          channel name if not
	   - uuid_type = channel: the module uses the channel name

	* Use doubles instead of floats for conversions when comparing strings.

	  In 13.9.0, there was an issue where PJSIP contacts added to an AOR would
	  be deleted at seemingly random times.

	  One reason this was happening was because of an operation to retrieve
	  the contacts whose expiration time was less than or equal to the current
	  time. When retrieving existing contacts, the contact's expiration time
	  and the current time were converted from a string to a float, and those
	  two floats were compared.

	  On some systems, including mine, this conversion was horribly off. For
	  instance, I could regularly see the string "1463079214" get converted
	  into 1463079168.000000. When switching from using a float to using a
	  double, the conversion was as expected.

	  Why was the conversion to float off? My best guess is that the
	  conversion to float was attempting to store the entire value in the 23
	  bit significand of the IEEE-754 floating point number. In particular, if
	  you take only the 23 most significant bits of 1463079214, you get the
	  messed up 1463079168 that we were seeing in the conversion. It likely
	  was possible to get a more precise value by composing the number using
	  an exponent, but the conversion did not work that way. With a double,
	  you have a 52 bit significand, allowing the entire value to fit there,
	  and thereby allowing an accurate conversion.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: generate correct Contact URI for TLS

	  There are two types of SIP URIs indicating a secure transport:
	  * sips:user@example.org
	  * sip:user@example.org;transport=tls

	  When using a sips URI, Asterisk checks incoming INVITEs and answers from
	  the other side for sips URIs, and rejects the packet if there are only
	  sip URIs. So Asterisk should only generate a sips Contact URI if the
	  other side supports it.

	  This patch makes Asterisk generate either a sip or sips Contact URI
	  depending on the format of the server URI.

	  If you want a sip URI, use:
	  server_uri=sip:example.org\;transport=tls

	  If you want a sips URI, use:
	  server_uri=sips:example.org

	* res_pjsip_authenticator_digest: Don't use source port in nonce verification

	  From the issue reporter:
	  "res_pjsip_outbound_authenticator_digest builds a nonce that is a hash of
	  the timestamp, the source address, the source port, a server UUID that is
	  calculated at startup, and the authentication realm.

	  Rather than caching nonces that we create, we instead attempt to re-calculate
	  the nonce when receiving an incoming request with authentication. We then
	  compare the re-calculated nonce to the incoming nonce, and if they don't match,
	  then authentication has failed early.

	  The problem is that it is possible, especially when using TCP, to receive two
	  requests from the same endpoint but have differing source ports for those
	  requests. Asterisk itself commonly will use different source ports for
	  outbound TCP requests."

	  This patch removes the source port dependency when building the nonce.

	  For all OSes:
	  * Disabled third-party codecs in pjproject and added
	    '--disable-speex-codec --disable-speex-aec --disable-gsm-codec' to the
	    configure options since we don't use the pjsip codec capability.

	  FreeBSD:
	  * Added FreeBSD support to install_prereq.
	  * Changed pjproject/configure.m4 to use $GNU_MAKE instead of hardcoding "make".
	  * Added __progname and environ to asterisk.exports.in.
	  * Reverted the use of ldconfig to create shared library symlinks to ln.
	  * Only enable epoll in pjproject if `uname -s` is Linux.
	  * Added a patch to pjproject to take the name of the 'make' command from
	    an environment variable if supplied.  This is needed for the python bindings.
	    (merged by Teluu into pjproject trunk 5/3/2016)
	  FreeBSD support isn't complete.  Still some general issues regarding
	  make/gmake having nothing to do with pjproject.  With some handholding it DOES
	  build successfully.

	  CentOS:
	  Added 'patch' and 'bzip2' to install_prereq PACKAGES_RH.
	  CentOS 6/7 32/64 build and run the pjsip testsuite successfully.

	  Ubuntu:
	  No changes required.
	  Ubuntu 15/16 32/64 build and run the pjsip testsuite successfully.

	  Debian:
	  No changes required.
	  Debian 6/7/8 32/64 build and run the pjsip testsuite successfully.

	  There will utimately be a follow-up patch to create an install_prereq for
	  the testsuite as I've discovered a few missing requirements.

	* res_pjsip_exten_state: Create PUBLISH messages.

	  Create PUBLISH messages to update a third party when an extension state
	  changes because of either a device or presence state change.

	  A configuration example:

	  [exten-state-publisher]
	  type=outbound-publish
	  server_uri=sip:instance1@172.16.10.2
	  event=presence
	  ; Optional regex for context filtering, if specified only extension state
	  ; for contexts matching the regex will cause a PUBLISH to be sent.
	  @context=^users
	  ; Optional regex for extension filtering, if specified only extension
	  ; state for extensions matching the regex will cause a PUBLISH to be sent.
	  @exten=^[0-9]*
	  ; Required body type for the PUBLISH message.
	  ;
	  ; Supported values are:
	  ; application/pidf+xml
	  ; application/xpidf+xml
	  ; application/cpim-pidf+xml
	  ; application/dialog-info+xml (Planned support but not yet)
	  @body=application/pidf+xml

	  The '@' extended variables are used because the implementation can't
	  extend the outbound publish type as it is provided by the outbound publish
	  module.  That means you either have to use extended variables, or
	  implement some sort of custom extended variable thing in the outbound
	  publish module.  Another option would be to refactor that stuff to have an
	  option which specifies the use of an alternate implementation's
	  configuration and then have that passed to the implementation.  JColp
	  opted for the extended variables method originally.

	* res_pjsip:  Add ability to identify by Authorization username

	  A feature of chan_sip that service providers relied upon was the ability to
	  identify by the Authorization username.  This is most often used when customers
	  have a PBX that needs to register rather than identify by IP address.  From my
	  own experiance, this is pretty common with small businesses who otherwise
	  don't need a static IP.

	  In this scenario, a register from the customer's PBX may succeed because From
	  will usually contain the PBXs account id but an INVITE will contain the caller
	  id.  With nothing recognizable in From, the service provider's Asterisk can
	  never match to an endpoint and the INVITE just stays unauthorized.

	  The fixes:

	  A new value "auth_username" has been added to endpoint/identify_by that
	  will use the username and digest fields in the Authorization header
	  instead of username and domain in the the From header to match an endpoint,
	  or the To header to match an aor.  This code as added to
	  res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_user rather than creating a new module.

	  Although identify_by was always a comma-separated list, there was only
	  1 choice so order wasn't preserved.  So to keep the order, a vector was added
	  to the end of ast_sip_endpoint.  This is only used by res_pjsip_registrar
	  to find the aor.  The res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_* modules are called in
	  globals/endpoint_identifier_order.

	  Along the way, the logic in res_pjsip_registrar was corrected to match
	  most-specific to least-specific as res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_user does.

	  The order is:

	  username@domain
	  username@domain_alias
	  username

	  Auth by username does present 1 problem however, the first INVITE won't have
	  an Authorization header so the distributor, not finding a match on anything,
	  sends a securty_alert.  It still sends a 401 with a challenge so the next
	  INVITE will have the Authorization header and presumably succeed.  As a result
	  though, that first security alert is actually a false alarm.

	  To address this, a new feature has been added to pjsip_distributor that keeps
	  track of unidentified requests and only sends the security alert if a
	  configurable number of unidentified requests come from the same IP in a
	  configurable amout of time.  Those configuration options have been added to
	  the global config object.  This feature is only used when auth_username
	  is enabled.

	  Finally, default_realm was added to the globals object to replace the hard
	  coded "asterisk" used when an endpoint is not yet identified.

	  The testsuite tests all pass but new tests are forthcoming for this new
	  feature.

	  A patch I did back in 2014 modified ast_config_text_file_save2 to check the
	  writability of the main file and include files before truncating and re-writing
	  them.  An unintended side-effect of this was that if a file doesn't exist,

	  This patch causes ast_config_text_file_save2 to check the writability of the
	  parent directory of missing files instead of checking the file itself.  This
	  allows missing files to be created again.  A unit test was also added to
	  test_config to test saving of config files.

	* app_queue: queue members can receive multiple calls

	  It was possible for a queue member that is a member of at least 2 or more

	  from another queue, and it is found to already exist in the pending member
	  container then it will not ring that member.

	* res_agi:  Prevent run_agi from eating frames it shouldn't

	  The run_agi function is eating control frames when it shouldn't be. This is
	  causing issues when an AGI is run from CONNECTED_LINE_SEND_SUB in a blond
	  transfer.

	  Alice calls Bob. Bob attended transfers to Charlie but hangs up before Charlie
	  answers.

	  Alice gets the COLP UPDATE indicating Charlie but Charlie never gets an UPDATE
	  and is left thinking he's connected to Bob.

	  In this case, when CONNECTED_LINE_SEND_SUB runs on Alice's channel and it calls
	  an AGI, the extra eaten frames prevent CONNECTED_LINE_SEND_SUB from running on
	  Charlie's channel.

	  The fix was to accumulate deferrable frames in the "forever" loop instead of
	  dropping them, and re-queue them just before running the actual agi command
	  or exiting.

	* bridge_softmix.c: Fix crash if channel fails to join mixing tech.

	  softmix_bridge_join() failed because of an allocation failure.  To address
	  this, the softmix bridge technology now checks if the channel failed to
	  join softmix successfully.  In addition, the bridge now begins the process
	  of kicking the channel out of the bridge so we don't have channels
	  partially in the bridge for very long.

	  * Fix the test_channel_feature_hooks.c unit tests.  The test channel must
	  have a valid codec to join the simple_bridge technology.  This patch makes
	  joining a bridge more strict by not allowing partially joined channels to
	  remain in the bridge.

	* func_odbc: Use one connection per DSN.

	  res_odbc was changed in Asterisk 13.8.0 to remove connection management,
	  opting instead to let unixodbc maintain open connections and return
	  those to Asterisk as requested.

	  This was a boon for realtime, since it meant that multiple threads could
	  potentially run parallel queries since they could each be using their
	  own database connections.

	  However, on the user-facing side, func_odbc, there were some inherent
	  behaviors being relied on that no longer hold true after the change.
	  One such reported behavior was that MySQL's LAST_INSERTED_ID() works
	  per-connection. This means that if Asterisk uses separate connections
	  for every database operation, whereas before it used one connection for
	  everything, we have broken expectations and functionality.

	  The fix provided in this patch is to make func_odbc use a single
	  database connection per DSN. This way, user-facing database usage will
	  have the same behavior as it did pre-13.8.0. However, realtime, which is
	  the real workhorse of database interaction, will continue to let
	  unixodbc manage connections.

	* res_stasis: Handle re-enter stasis bridge with swap channel.

	  We lose the fact that there is a swap channel if there is one.  We
	  currently wind up rejoining the stasis bridge as a normal join after the
	  swap channel has already been kicked from the bridge.

	  This patch preserves the swap channel so the AMI/ARI events can note that
	  the channel joining the bridge is swapping with another channel.  Another
	  benefit to swaqpping in one operation is if there are any channels that
	  get lonely (MOH, bridge playback, and bridge record channels).  The lonely
	  channels won't leave before the joining channel has a chance to come back
	  in under stasis if the swap channel is the only reason the lonely channels
	  are staying in the bridge.

	* bridge: Hold off more than one imparting channel at a time.

	  An earlier patch blocked the ast_bridge_impart() call until the channel
	  either entered the target bridge or it failed.  Unfortuantely, if the
	  target bridge is stasis and the imprted channel is not a stasis channel,
	  stasis bounces the channel out of the bridge to come back into the bridge
	  as a proper stasis channel.  When the channel is bounced out, that
	  released the block on ast_bridge_impart() to continue.  If the impart was
	  a result of a transfer, then it became a race to see if the swap channel
	  would get hung up before the imparted channel could come back into the
	  stasis bridge.  If the imparted channel won then everything is fine.  If
	  the swap channel gets hung up first then the transfer will fail because
	  the swap channel is leaving the bridge.

	  * Allow a chain of ast_bridge_impart()'s to happen before any are
	  unblocked to prevent the race condition described above.  When the channel
	  finally joins the bridge or completely fails to join the bridge then the
	  ast_bridge_impart() instances are unblocked.

	* PJSIP: Remove PJSIP parsing functions from uri length validation.

	  The PJSIP parsing functions provide a nice concise way to check the
	  length of a hostname in a SIP URI. The problem is that in order to use
	  those parsing functions, it's required to use them from a thread that
	  has registered with PJLib.

	  On startup, when parsing AOR configuration, the permanent URI handler
	  may not be run from a PJLib-registered thread. Specifically, this could
	  happen when Asterisk was started in daemon mode rather than
	  console-mode. If PJProject were compiled with assertions enabled, then
	  this would cause Asterisk to crash on startup.

	  The solution presented here is to do our own parsing of the contact URI
	  in order to ensure that the hostname in the URI is not too long. The
	  parsing does not attempt to perform a full SIP URI parse/validation,
	  since the hostname in the URI is what is important.

	* res_pjsip_registrar: Fix bad memory-ness with user_agent.

	  Recent changes to the PJSIP registrar resulted in tests failing due to
	  missing AOR_CONTACT_ADDED test events. The reason for this was that the
	  user_agent string had junk values in it, resulting in being unable to
	  generate the event.

	  I'm going to be honest here, I have no idea why this was happening. Here
	  are the steps needed for the user_agent variable to get messed up:
	  * REGISTER is received
	  * First contact in the REGISTER results in a contact being removed
	  * Second contact in the REGISTER results in a contact being added
	  * The contact, AOR, expiration, and user agent all have to be passed as
	    format parameters to the creation of a string. Any subset of those
	    parameters would not be enough to cause the problem.

	  Looking into what was happening, the thing that struck me as odd was
	  that the user_agent variable was meant to be set to the value of the
	  User-Agent SIP header in the incoming REGISTER. However, when removing a
	  contact, the user_agent variable would be set (via ast_strdupa inside a
	  loop) to the stored contact's user_agent. This means that the
	  user_agent's value would be incorrect when attempting to process further
	  contacts in the incoming REGISTER.

	  The fix here is to use a different variable for the stored user agent
	  when removing a contact. Correcting the behavior to be correct also
	  means the memory usage is less weird, and the issue no longer occurs.

	* res_pjsip:  Add serialized scheduler (res_pjsip/pjsip_scheduler.c)

	  There are several places that do scheduled tasks or periodic housecleaning,
	  each with its own implementation:

	  * res_pjsip_keepalive has a thread that sends keepalives.
	  * pjsip_distributor has a thread that cleans up expired unidentified requests.
	  * res_pjsip_registrar_expire has a thread that cleans up expired contacts.
	  * res_pjsip_pubsub uses ast_sched directly and then calls ast_sip_push_task.
	  * res_pjsip_sdp_rtp also uses ast_sched to send keepalives.

	  There are also places where we should be doing scheduled work but aren't.
	  A good example are the places we have sorcery observers to start registration
	  or qualify.  These don't work when changes are made to a backend database
	  without a pjsip reload.  We need to check periodically.

	  As a first step to solving these issues, a new ast_sip_sched facility has
	  been created.

	  ast_sip_sched wraps ast_sched but only uses ast_sched as a scheduled queue.
	  When a task is ready to run, ast_sip_task_pusk is called for it. This ensures
	  that the task is executed in a PJLIB registered thread and doesn't hold up the
	  ast_sched thread so it can immediately continue processing the queue.  The
	  serializer used by ast_sip_sched is one of your choosing or a random one from
	  the res_pjsip pool if you don't choose one.

	  Another feature is the ability to automatically clean up the task_data when the
	  task expires (if ever).  If it's an ao2 object, it will be dereferenced, if
	  it's a malloc'd object it will be freed.  This is selectable when the task is
	  scheduled.  Even if you choose to not auto dereference an ao2 task data object,
	  the scheduler itself maintains a reference to it while the task is under it's
	  control.  This prevents the data from disappearing out from under the task.

	  There are two scheduling models.

	  AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_PERIODIC specifies that the invocations of the task occur at
	  the specific interval.  That is, every "interval" milliseconds, regardless of
	  how long the task takes.  If the task takes longer than the interval, it will
	  be scheduled at the next available multiple of interval.  For exmaple: If the
	  task has an interval of 60 secs and the task takes 70 secs (it better not),
	  the next invocation will happen at 120 seconds.

	  AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_DELAY specifies that the next invocation of the task should
	  start "interval" milliseconds after the current invocation has finished.

	  Also, the same ast_sched facility for fixed or variable intervals exists.  The
	  task's return code in conjunction with the AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_FIXED or
	  AST_SIP_SCHED_TASK_VARIABLE flags controls the next invocation start time.

	  One res_pjsip.h housekeeping change was made.  The pjsip header files were
	  added to the top.  There have been a few cases lately where I've needed
	  res_pjsip.h just for ast_sip calls and had compiles fail spectacularly because
	  I didn't add the pjsip header files to my source even though I never referenced
	  any pjsip calls.

	  Finally, a few new convenience APIs were added to astobj2 to make things a
	  little easier in the scheduler.  ao2_ref_and_lock() calls ao2_ref() and
	  ao2_lock() in one go.  ao2_unlock_and_unref() does the reverse. A few macros
	  were also copied from res_phoneprov because I got tired of having to duplicate
	  the same hash, sort and compare functions over and over again. The
	  AO2_STRING_FIELD_(HASH|SORT|CMP)_FN macros will insert functions suitable for
	  aor_container_alloc into your source.

	  This facility can be used immediately for the situations where we already have
	  a thread that wakes up periodically or do some scheduled work.  For the
	  registration and qualify issues, additional sorcery and schema changes would
	  need to be made so that we can easily detect changed objects on a periodic
	  basis without having to pull the entire database back to check.  I'm thinking
	  of a last-updated timestamp on the rows but more on this later.

	  "Idle" here means that someone connects to us and does not send a SIP

	  When we receive an incoming TCP connection, we will start a timer
	  (equivalent to transaction timer D) waiting to receive an incoming
	  request. If we do not receive a request in that timeframe, then we will
	  shut down the TCP connection.

	* pjproject:  Add patch for removing strip of '[]' from header params

	  From the patch submitted to Teluu on 4/12/2016
	  <<<<<<<<<
	  The wholesale stripping of '[]' from header parameters causes issues if
	  something (like a port) occurs after the final ']'.

	  '[2001:a::b]' will correctly parse to '2001:a::b'
	  '[2001:a::b]:8080' will correctly parse to '2001:a::b' but the scanner is left
	  with ':8080' and parsing stops with a syntax error.

	  I can't even find a case where stripping the '[]' is a good thing anyway.  Even
	  if you continued to parse and resulted in a string that looks like this...
	  '2001:a::b:8080', it's not valid.

	  This came up in Asterisk because Kamailio sends us a Contact with an alias
	  URI parameter that has an IPv6 address in it like this:
	  Contact: <sip:1171@127.0.0.1:5080;alias=[2001:1:2::3]~43691~6>
	  which should be legal but causes a syntax error because of the characters
	  after the final ']'.  Even if it didn't, the '[]' should still not be stripped.

	  I've run the Asterisk Test Suite for PJSIP (252 tests) many of which are IPv6
	  enabled.  No issues were caused by removing the code that strips the '[]'.

	* lock:  Add named lock capability

	  Locking some objects like sorcery objects can be tricky because the underlying
	  ao2 object may not be the same for all callers.  For instance, two threads that
	  call ast_sorcery_retrieve_by_id on the same aor name might actually get 2
	  different ao2 objects if the underlying wizard had to rehydrate the aor from a
	  database. Locking one ao2 object doesn't have any effect on the other even if
	  those objects had locks in the first place.

	  Named locks allow access control by keyspace and key strings.  Now an "aor"
	  named "1000" can be locked and any other thread attempting to lock "aor" "1000"
	  will wait regardless of whether the underlying ao2 object is the same or not.
	  Mutex and rwlocks are supported.

	  This capability will initially be used to lock an aor when multiple threads may
	  be attempting to prune expired contacts from it.

	* pbx: Add support for autohints.

	  This change introduces the concept of autohints. These are hints
	  which are created as a result of device state changes occurring within
	  the core. When this happens a hint will be created (if it does not
	  exist already) using the device name as the extension.

	  For example if a device state change is received for "PJSIP/bob"
	  and autohints are enabled on a context then a hint will exist in
	  that context for "bob" with a device of "PJSIP/bob".

	  For virtual or custom device states the name after the type will
	  be used. For example if the device state of "Custom:bob" changes
	  then a hint will exist in that context for "bob" with a device of
	  "Custom:bob".

	  This functionality can be enabled in extensions.conf by placing
	  "autohints=yes" in a context.

	* res_pjsip: Handle deferred SDP hold/unhold properly.

	  Some SIP devices indicate hold/unhold using deferred SDP reinvites. In
	  other words, they provide no SDP in the reinvite.

	  A typical transaction that starts hold might look something like this:

	  * Device sends reinvite with no SDP
	  * Asterisk sends 200 OK with SDP indicating sendrecv on streams.
	  * Device sends ACK with SDP indicating sendonly on streams.

	  At this point, PJMedia's SDP negotiator saves Asterisk's local state as
	  being recvonly.

	  Now, when the device attempts to unhold, it again uses a deferred SDP
	  reinvite, so we end up doing the following:

	  * Device sends reinvite with no SDP
	  * Asterisk sends 200 OK with SDP indicating recvonly on streams
	  * Device sends ACK with SDP indicating sendonly on streams

	  The problem here is that Asterisk offered recvonly, and by RFC 3264's
	  rules, if an offer is recvonly, the answer has to be sendonly. The
	  result is that the device is not taken off hold.

	  What is supposed to happen is that Asterisk should indicate sendrecv in
	  the 200 OK that it sends. This way, the device has the freedom to
	  indicate sendrecv if it wants the stream taken off hold, or it can
	  continue to respond with sendonly if the purpose of the reinvite was
	  something else (like a session timer refresher).

	  The fix here is to alter the SDP negotiator's state when we receive a
	  reinvite with no SDP. If the negotiator's state is currently in the
	  recvonly or inactive state, then we alter our local state to be
	  sendrecv. This way, we allow the device to indicate the stream state as
	  desired.

	* config:  Allow filters when appending to a category

	  In sorcery based config files where there are multiple categories with the same
	  name, you can't use the (+) operator to reliably append to a category because
	  config.c stops looking when it finds the first one with the same name.

	  Example:

	  [1000]
	  type = endpoint

	  [1000]
	  type = aor

	  [1000](+)
	  authenticate_qualify = yes

	  This config will fail because config.c appends authenticate_qualify to the
	  first category it finds, the endpoint, and that's not valid for endpoint.

	  Solution:

	  The capability to find a category that contains a certain variable already
	  exists so the only real change was to parse anything after the '+' that's not a
	  comma, as a filter string.

	  [1000]
	  type = endpoint

	  [1000]
	  type = aor

	  [1000](+type=aor)
	  authenticate_qualify = yes

	  This now works as expected.

	  Although the following example doesn't make any sense for pjsip, you can even
	  specify multiple filters:

	  [1000](+type=aor&qualify_frequency=10)

	* stringfields:  Refactor to allow fields to be added to the end of structures

	  String fields are great, except that you can't add new ones without breaking
	  ABI compatibility because it shifts down everything else in the structure.
	  The only alternative is to add your own char * field to the end of the
	  structure and manage the memory yourself which isn't ideal, especially since
	  you then can't use the OPT_STRINGFIELD_T type.

	  Background:

	  The reason string fields had to be declared inside the
	  AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS block was to facilitate iteration over all declared
	  fields for initialization, compare and copy.  Since AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS
	  declared the pool, then the fields, then the manager, you could use the offsets
	  of the pool and manager and iterate over the sequential addresses in between to
	  access the fields. The actual pool, field allocation and field set operations
	  don't actually care where the field is.  It's just iteration over the fields
	  that was the problem.

	  Solution: Extended String Fields

	  An extended string field is one that is declared outside the
	  AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS block but still (anywhere) inside the parent
	  structure.  Other than using AST_STRING_FIELD_EXTENDED instead of
	  AST_STRING_FIELD, it looks the same as other string fields.  It's storage comes
	  from the pool and it participates in string field compare and copy operations
	  peformed on the parent structure. It's also a valid target for the
	  OPT_STRINGFIELD_T aco option type.

	  Implementation:

	  To keep track of the extended fields and make sure that ABI isn't broken, the
	  existing embedded_pool pointer in the manager structure was repurposed to be a
	  pointer to a separate header structure that contains the embedded_pool pointer
	  plus a vector of fields.  The length of the manager structure didn't change and
	  the embedded_pool pointer isn't used in the macros, only the stringfields C
	  code.  A side benefit of this is that changing the header structure in the
	  future won't break ABI.

	  ast_string_fields_init initializes the normal string fields and appends them to
	  the vector, and subsequent calls to ast_string_field_init_extended initialize
	  and append the extended fields. Cleanup, ast_string_fields_cmp, and
	  ast_string_fields_copy can now work on the vector instead of sequentially
	  traversing the addresses between the pool and manager.

	  The total size of a structure using string fields didn't change, whether using
	  extended fields or not, nor have the offsets of any structure members, either
	  inside the original block or outside.  Adding an extended field to the end of a
	  structure is the same as adding a char *.

	  Details:

	  The stringfield C code was pulled out from utils.c and into stringfields.c.
	  It just made sense.

	  Additional work was done in ast_string_field_init and
	  ast_calloc_with_stringfields to handle the allocation of the new header
	  structure and the vector, and the associated cleanup.  In the process some
	  additional NULL pointer checking was added.

	  A lot of work was done in stringfields.h since the logic for compare and copy
	  is there.  Documentation was added as well as somne additional NULL checking.

	  The ability to call ast_calloc_with_stringfields with a number of structures
	  greater than 1 never really worked.  Well, the calloc worked but there was no
	  way to access the additional structures or clean them up.  It was agreed that
	  there was no use case for requesting more than 1 structure so an ast_assert
	  was added to prevent it and the iteration code removed.

	  Testing:

	  The stringfield unit tests were updated to test both normal and extended
	  fields.  Tests for ast_string_field_ptr_set_by_fields and
	  ast_calloc_with_stringfields were also added.

	  As an ABI test, 13 was compiled from git and the res_pjsip_* modules, except
	  res_pjsip itself, saved off.  The patch was then added and a full compile and
	  install was performed.  Then the older res_pjsip_* moduled were copied over the
	  installed versions so res_pjsip was new and the rest were old.  No issues.

	  contact->aor, which is a char * at the end of contact, was then changed to an
	  extended string field and a recompile and reinstall was performed, again
	  leaving stock versions of the the res_pjsip_* modules.  Again, no issues with
	  the res_pjsip_* modules using the old stringfield implementation and with
	  contact->aor as a char *, and res_pjsip itself using the new stringfield
	  implementation and contact->aor being an extended string field.

	  Finally, several existing string fields were converted to extended string
	  fields to test OPT_STRINGFIELD_T.  Again, no issues.

	* res_stasis: Add control ref to playback and recording structs.

	  The stasis_app_playback and stasis_app_recording structs need to have a
	  struct stasis_app_control ref.  Other threads can get a reference to the
	  playback and recording structs from their respective global container.
	  These other threads can then use the control pointer they contain after
	  the control struct has gone.

	  * Add control ref to stasis_app_playback and stasis_app_recording structs.

	  With the refs added, the control command queue can now have a circular
	  control reference which will cause the control struct to never get
	  released if the control's command queue is not flushed when the channel
	  leaves the Stasis application.  Also the command queue needs better
	  protection from adding commands if the control->is_done flag is set.

	  * Flush the control command queue on exit.

	  * Give the struct stasis_app_control ao2 object a ref to the channel held
	  in the object.  Now the channel will still be around if a thread needs to
	  post a stasis message instead of crash because the topic was destroyed.

	  * Moved stopping any lingering silence generator out of the struct
	  stasis_app_control destructor and made it a part of exiting the Stasis
	  application.  Who knows which thread the destructor will be called under
	  so it cannot affect the channel's silence generator.  Not only was the
	  channel unprotected when the silence generator was stopped, stasis may no
	  longer even control the channel.

	* res_pjsip_mwi:  Allow subscribe to vm access extension as an alias

	  Background:

	  If your extension is 1000 and the voicemail access extension is 1571 and you
	  dial 1571, usually a dialplan rule calls voicemailmain with your extension and
	  you are placed directly in your mailbox.  Therefore most admins program the
	  voicemail (or other speed dial) button on their phones to the access extension.
	  Some phones (Snom at least) use whatever is programmed there to also subscribe
	  for MWI and so can't dial one number and subscribe to another.  This works fine
	  in chan_sip because chan_sip completely ignores the user portion of the
	  SUBSCRIBE message request URI.  If it can match the peer, is subscribes to the
	  peer's mailbox.  The user could be set to anything or nothing and you'd still
	  get subscribed to your mailbox.

	  Issue:

	  chan_pjsip actually uses the user portion of the URI to find an aor and its
	  mailboxes.  Therefore a subscribe to 1571 results in a 404.  Sure, you can
	  create an aor for 1571 but you certainly can't add your entire voicemail
	  system's mailboxes to it and everyone would get notified of every MWI.

	  Solution:

	  When an MWI subscribe comes in and an aor can't be found that matches the
	  resource directly, check the resource against the endpoint's aors.  If an aor
	  is found that has a voicemail_extension that matches the resource, use it.

	* res_pjsip_mwi:  Add voicemail extension and mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited

	  res_pjsip_mwi was missing the chan_sip "vmexten" functionality which adds
	  the Message-Account header to the MWI NOTIFY.  Also, specifying mailboxes
	  on endpoints for unsolicited mwi and on aors for subscriptions required
	  that the admin know in advance which the client wanted.  If you specified
	  mailboxes on the endpoint, subscriptions were rejected even if you also
	  specified mailboxes on the aor.

	  Voicemail extension:
	  * Added a global default_voicemail_extension which defaults to "".
	  * Added voicemail_extension to both endpoint and aor.
	  * Added ast_sip_subscription_get_dialog for support.
	  * Added ast_sip_subscription_get_sip_uri for support.

	  When an unsolicited NOTIFY is constructed, the From header is parsed, the
	  voicemail extension from the endpoint is substituted for the user, and the
	  result placed in the Message-Account field in the body.

	  When a subscribed NOTIFY is constructed, the subscription dialog local uri
	  is parsed, the voicemail_extension from the aor (looked up from the
	  subscription resource name) is substituted for the user, and the result
	  placed in the Message-Account field in the body.

	  If no voicemail extension was defined, the Message-Account field is not added
	  to the NOTIFY body.

	  mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited:
	  * Added mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited to endpoint.

	  The previous behavior was to reject a subscribe if a previous internal
	  subscription for unsolicited MWI was found for the mailbox.  That remains the
	  default.  However, if there are mailboxes also set on the aor and the client
	  subscribes and mwi_subscribe_replaces_unsolicited is set, the existing internal
	  subscription is removed and replaced with the external subscription.  This
	  allows an admin to configure mailboxes on both the endpoint and aor and allows
	  the client to select which to use.

	  Commit 1bce690ccb36a4744a327c07af23a9a3a0fa20cd was incrementing txcount
	  for rtcp packets as well as rtp packets and that was causing sender reports
	  to be generated instead of receiver reports in cases where no rtp was actually
	  being sent.

	  Moved the txcount increment from __rtp_sento, which handles both rtp and rtcp,
	  to rtp_sento which only handles rtp packets.

	  Discovered by the hep/rtcp-receiver test.

	  private header so it made sense to move the existing channel commands as well.

	* res_pjsip/pjsip_options:  Fix From generation on outgoing OPTIONS

	  No one seemed to notice but every time an OPTIONS goes out, it goes
	  out with a From of "asterisk" (or whatever the default from_user is set to),
	  even if you specify an endpoint.

	  The issue had several causes...
	  qualify_contact is only called with an endpoint if called from the CLI.
	  If the endpoint is NULL, qualify_contact only looks up the endpoint if
	  authenticate_qualify=yes. Even then, it never passes it on to
	  ast_sip_create_request where the From header is set.  Therefore From
	  is always "asterisk" (or whatever the default from_user is set to).
	  Even if ast_sip_create_request were to get an endpoint, it only sets
	  the From if endpoint->from_user is set.

	  The fix is 4 parts...

	  First, create_out_of_dialog_request was modified to use the endpoint id
	  if endpoint was specified and from_user is not set.

	  Second, qualify_contact was modified to always look up an endpoint if
	  one wasn't specified regardless of authenticate_qualify.  It then passes
	  the endpoint on to create_out_of_dialog_request.

	  Third (and most importantly), find_an_endpoint was modified to find
	  an endpoint by using an "aors LIKE %contact->aor%" predicate with
	  ast_sorcery_retrieve_by_fields.  As such, this patch will only work
	  if the sorcery realtime optimizations patch goes in.  Otherwise we'd
	  be pulling the entire endpoints database every time we send an OPTIONS.
	  Since we already know the contact's aor, the on_endpoint callback was also
	  modified to just check if the contact->aor is an exact match to one of
	  the endpoint's.

	  Finally, since we now have an endpoint for every OPTIONS request,
	  res_pjsip/endpt_send_request (which handles out-of-dialog reqests) was
	  updated to get the transport from the endpoint and set it on tdata.
	  Now the correct transport is used.

	* sorcery/res_pjsip:  Refactor for realtime performance

	  There were a number of places in the res_pjsip stack that were getting
	  all endpoints or all aors, and then filtering them locally.

	  A good example is pjsip_options which, on startup, retrieves all
	  endpoints, then the aors for those endpoints, then tests the aors to see
	  if the qualify_frequency is > 0.  One issue was that it never did
	  anything with the endpoints other than retrieve the aors so we probably
	  could have skipped a step and just retrieved all aors. But nevermind.

	  This worked reasonably well with local config files but with a realtime
	  backend and thousands of objects, this was a nightmare.  The issue
	  really boiled down to the fact that while realtime supports predicates
	  that are passed to the database engine, the non-realtime sorcery
	  backends didn't.

	  They do now.

	  The realtime engines have a scheme for doing simple comparisons. They
	  take in an ast_variable (or list) for matching, and the name of each
	  variable can contain an operator.  For instance, a name of
	  "qualify_frequency >" and a value of "0" would create a SQL predicate
	  that looks like "where qualify_frequency > '0'".  If there's no operator
	  after the name, the engines add an '=' so a simple name of
	  "qualify_frequency" and a value of "10" would return exact matches.

	  The non-realtime backends decide whether to include an object in a
	  result set by calling ast_sorcery_changeset_create on every object in
	  the internal container.  However, ast_sorcery_changeset_create only does
	  exact string matches though so a name of "qualify_frequency >" and a
	  value of "0" returns nothing because the literal "qualify_frequency >"
	  doesn't match any name in the objset set.

	  So, the real task was to create a generic string matcher that can take a
	  left value, operator and a right value and perform the match. To that
	  end, strings.c has a new ast_strings_match(left, operator, right)
	  function.  Left and right are the strings to operate on and the operator
	  can be a string containing any of the following: = (or NULL or ""), !=,
	  >, >=, <, <=, like or regex.  If the operator is like or regex, the
	  right string should be a %-pattern or a regex expression.  If both left
	  and right can be converted to float, then a numeric comparison is
	  performed, otherwise a string comparison is performed.

	  To use this new function on ast_variables, 2 new functions were added to
	  config.c.  One that compares 2 ast_variables, and one that compares 2
	  ast_variable lists.  The former is useful when you want to compare 2
	  ast_variables that happen to be in a list but don't want to traverse the
	  list.  The latter will traverse the right list and return true if all
	  the variables in it match the left list.

	  Now, the backends' fields_cmp functions call ast_variable_lists_match
	  instead of ast_sorcery_changeset_create and they can now process the
	  same syntax as the realtime engines.  The realtime backend just passes
	  the variable list unaltered to the engine.  The only gotcha is that
	  there's no common realtime engine support for regex so that's been noted
	  in the api docs for ast_sorcery_retrieve_by_fields.

	  Only one more change to sorcery was done...  A new config flag
	  "allow_unqualified_fetch" was added to reg_sorcery_realtime.
	  "no": ignore fetches if no predicate fields were supplied.
	  "error": same as no but emit an error. (good for testing)
	  "yes": allow (the default);
	  "warn": allow but emit a warning. (good for testing)

	  Now on to res_pjsip...

	  pjsip_options was modified to retrieve aors with qualify_frequency > 0
	  rather than all endpoints then all aors.  Not only was this a big
	  improvement in realtime retrieval but even for config files there's an
	  improvement because we're not going through endpoints anymore.

	  res_pjsip_mwi was modified to retieve only endpoints with something in
	  the mailboxes field instead of all endpoints then testing mailboxes.

	  res_pjsip_registrar_expire was completely refactored.  It was retrieving
	  all contacts then setting up scheduler entries to check for expiration.
	  Now, it's a single thread (like keepalive) that periodically retrieves
	  only contacts whose expiration time is < now and deletes them.  A new
	  contact_expiration_check_interval was added to global with a default of
	  30 seconds.

	  Ross Beer reports that with this patch, his Asterisk startup time dropped
	  from around an hour to under 30 seconds.

	  There are still objects that can't be filtered at the database like
	  identifies, transports, and registrations.  These are not going to be
	  anywhere near as numerous as endpoints, aors, auths, contacts however.

	  Back to allow_unqualified_fetch.  If this is set to yes and you have a
	  very large number of objects in the database, the pjsip CLI commands
	  will attempt to retrive ALL of them if not qualified with a LIKE.
	  Worse, if you type "pjsip show endpoint <tab>" guess what's going to
	  happen? :)  Having a cache helps but all the objects will have to be
	  retrieved at least once to fill the cache.  Setting
	  allow_unqualified_fetch=no prevents the mass retrieve and should be used
	  on endpoints, auths, aors, and contacts.  It should NOT be used for
	  identifies, registrations and transports since these MUST be
	  retrieved in bulk.

	  Example sorcery.conf:

	  [res_pjsip]
	  endpoint=config,pjsip.conf,criteria=type=endpoint
	  endpoint=realtime,ps_endpoints,allow_unqualified_fetch=error

	* res_parking: Fix blind transfer dynamic lots creation.

	  Blind transfers to a recognized parking extension need to use the parker's
	  channel variable values to create the dynamic parking lot.  This is
	  because there is always only one parker while the parkee may actually be a
	  multi-party bridge.  A multi-party bridge can never supply the needed
	  channel variables to create the dynamic parking lot.  In the multi-party
	  bridge blind transfer scenario, the parker's CHANNEL(parkinglot) value and
	  channel variables are inherited by the local channel used to park the
	  bridge.

	  * In park_common_setup(), make use the parker instead of the parkee to
	  supply the dynamic parking lot channel variable values.  In all but one
	  case, the parkee is the same as the parker.  However, in the recognized
	  parking extension blind transfer scenario for a two party bridge they are
	  different channels.  For consistency, we need to use the parker channel.

	  * In park_local_transfer(), pass the CHANNEL(parkinglot) value to the
	  local channel when blind transferring a multi-party bridge to a recognized
	  parking extension.

	  * When a local channel starts a call, the Local;2 side needs to inherit
	  the CHANNEL(parkinglot) value from Local;1.

	  The DTMF one-touch parking case wasn't even trying to create dynamic
	  parking lots before it aborted the attempt.

	  * In parking_park_call(), add missing code to create a dynamic parking
	  lot.

	  A DTMF bridge hook is documented as returning -1 to remove the hook.
	  Though the hook caller is really coded to accept non-zero.  See the
	  ast_bridge_hook_callback typedef.

	  * In feature_park_call(), don't remove the DTMF one-touch parking hook
	  because of an error.

	* Restrict CLI/AMI commands on shutdown.

	  When addressing how to fix this issue, we initially considered fixing
	  individual crashes we observed. However, the changes required to fix

	  Instead, this change makes it so AMI and CLI commands cannot be executed

	  during Asterisk shutdown.

	* chan_sip: Do not send all codecs on INVITE. Do not break on Session-Timers.

	  Asterisk 13.7.0 included a fix for ASTERISK-24543, not to send all those
	  codecs, which the caller did not request/support. That fix was not complete
	  because on the second Session Timer all codecs were sent again. Some VoIP/SIP
	  clients interpreted that complete codec-list as a change in the SIP session.
	  Because of that, Asterisk did not send the RTP audio via NAT anymore which
	  created a non-audio scenario after the second Session Timer fired.

	  The fix to ASTERISK-25407 introduced the usage of LOG_MAKEPRI. However
	  this macro is broken in older glibc (< 2.17); it would left-shift the

	* main/app: Only look to end of file if ':end' is specified, and not just ':'

	  There is a little known feature in app_controlplayback that will cause the
	  specified offset to be used relative to the end of a file if a ':end' is
	  detected within the filename.

	  This feature is pretty bad, but okay.

	  However, a bug exists in this code where a ':' detected in the filename
	  will cause the end pointer to be non-NULL, even if the full ':end' isn't
	  specified. This causes us to treat an unspecified offset (0) as being
	  "start playing from the end of the file", resulting in no file playback
	  occurring.

	  This patch fixes this bug by resetting the end pointer if ':end' is not
	  found in the filename.

	  This patch allows applications/APIs that access media through the core file
	  APIs to play media in the media cache. Prior to determining if a 'filename'
	  exists, the filename is passed to the media cache's retrieve API call. If
	  that call succeeds, the local file specified passed back by the API is
	  opened for streaming. When used in this fashion, the 'filename' is actually
	  a URI that the media cache process and understand.

	* res/res_http_media_cache: Add an HTTP(S) backend for the core media cache

	  This patch adds a bucket backend for the core media cache that interfaces to a
	  remote HTTP server. When a media item is requested in the cache, the cache will
	  query its bucket backends to see if they can provide the media item. If that
	  media item has a scheme of HTTP or HTTPS, this backend will be invoked.

	  The backend provides callbacks for the following:
	   * create - this will always retrieve the URI specified by the provided
	              bucket_file, and store it in the file specified by the object.
	   * retrieve - this will pull the URI specified and store it in a temporary
	                file. It is then up to the media cache to move/rename this file
	                if desired.
	   * delete - destroys the file associated with the bucket_file.
	   * stale - if the bucket_file has expired, based on received HTTP headers from
	             the remote server, or if the ETag on the server no longer matches
	             the ETag stored on the bucket_file, the resource is determined to be
	             stale.

	  Note that the backend respects the ETag, Expires, and Cache-Control headers
	  provided by the HTTP server it is querying.

	* main/media_cache: Provide an extension on the local file associated with a URI

	  This patch does the following:

	  First, it addresses file extension handling in the media cache. The media core
	  in Asterisk is a bit interesting in that it wants:
	   * A file to have an extension on it. That extension is used to associate the
	     file with a defined format module.
	   * The filename passed to the core to not have an extension on it. This allows
	     the core to match the available file formats with the format a channel
	     is capable of handling.

	  Unfortunately, this makes the current implementation a bit lacking in the media
	  cache. By default, we do not store the extension of a retrieved URI on the
	  local file that is created. As a result, the media core does not know what
	  format the file is, and the file is ignored. Modifying the file outside of the
	  media core is bad, as we would not be able to update the internal
	  ast_bucket_file's path.

	  At the same time, we do not want to pass the extension out in the file_path
	  parameter in ast_media_cache_retrieve. This parameter is intended to be fed
	  into the media core; if we passed the extension, all callers would have to
	  strip it off.

	  Thus, this patch does the following:
	  * If there is an extension specified in the URL, we append it to the local
	    file name (if a preferred file name isn't specified), and we store that
	    in the local file path.
	  * The extension, however, is stripped off of the file_path parameter passed
	    back out of ast_media_cache_retrieve.

	  Second, this patch causes stale items to be completely removed from the system.
	  Prior to this patch, sound files could be orphaned due to the bucket
	  referencing the file being deleted, but the file itself not being removed. This
	  is now addressed by explicitly calling ast_bucket_file_delete on the
	  bucket_file when it is deemed to be stale. Note that this only happen when we
	  know we will attempt to retrieve the resource again.

	  Finally, this patch changes the AO2 container holding media items to just use
	  a regular mutex. The usage for this container already assumed it was a plain
	  mutex, and - given that retrieval of an item can cause it to be replaced in
	  the container - a mutex makes more sense than a read/write lock.

	* funcs/func_curl: Add the ability for CURL to download and store files

	  This patch adds a write option to the CURL dialplan function, allowing it to
	  CURL files and store them locally. The value 'written' to the CURL URL
	  specifies the location on disk to store the file. As an example:

	  same => n,Set(CURL(http://1.1.1.1/foo.wav)=/tmp/foo.wav)

	  Would retrieve the file foo.wav from the remote server and store it in the
	  /tmp directory.

	  Due to the potentially dangerous nature of this function call, APIs are
	  forbidden from using the write functionality unless live_dangerously is set
	  to True in asterisk.conf.

	* chan_pjsip: transfers with direct media reinvite has wrong address/port

	  During a transfer involving direct media a race occurs between when the
	  transferer channel is swapped out, initiating rtp changes/updates, and the
	  subsequent reinvites.

	  When Alice, after speaking with Charlie (Bob is on hold), connects Bob and
	  Charlie invites are sent to each in order to establish the call between them.
	  Bob is taken off hold and Charlie is told to have his media flow through
	  Asterisk. However, if before those invites go out the bridge updates Bob's
	  and/or Charlie's rtp information with direct media data (i.e. address, port)
	  then the invite(s) will contain the remote data in the SDP instead of the
	  Asterisk data.

	  The race occurs in the native bridge glue code when updating the peer. The
	  direct_media_address can get set twice before sending out the first invite
	  during call connection. This can happen because the checking/setting of the
	  direct_media_address happened in one thread while the sending of the invite(s)
	  happened in another thread.

	  This fix removes the race condition by moving the checking/setting of the
	  direct_media_address to be in the same thread as the sending of the invites(s).
	  This serializes the checking/setting and sending so they can no longer happen
	  out of order.

	  is running when you try to stop the event.  If you hold a lock needed by
	  the scheduled event while trying to stop the scheduled event then a
	  deadlock can happen.  The general strategy for resolving the deadlock
	  potential is to push the actual starting and stopping of the scheduled
	  events off onto the scheduler/do_monitor() thread by scheduling an
	  immediate one shot scheduled event.  Some restructuring may be needed
	  because the code may assume that the start/stop of the scheduled events is
	  immediate.

	* sip/dialplan_functions.c: Fix /channels/chan_sip/test_sip_rtpqos crash.

	  This patch is part of a series to resolve deadlocks in chan_sip.c.

	  Delaying destruction of the chan_sip sip_pvt structures caused the
	  /channels/chan_sip/test_sip_rtpqos unit test to crash.  That test
	  registers a special test ast_rtp_engine with the rtp engine module.  When
	  the unit test completes it cleans up by unregistering the test
	  ast_rtp_engine and exits.  Since the delayed destruction of the sip_pvt
	  happens after the unit test returns, the destructor tries to call the rtp
	  engine destroy callback of the test ast_rtp_engine auto variable which no
	  longer exists on the stack.

	  * Change the test ast_rtp_engine auto variable to a static variable.  Now
	  the variable can still exist after the unit test exits so the delayed
	  sip_pvt destruction can complete successfully.

	* build_system:  Split COMPILE_DOUBLE from DONT_OPTIMIZE

	  I can't ever recall actually needing the intermediate files or the checking
	  that a double compile produces.  What I CAN remember is every DONT_OPTIMIZE
	  build needing 3 invocations of gcc instead of 1 just to do the checks and
	  produce those intermediate files.

	  Having said that, Richard pointed out that the reason for the double compile
	  was that there were cases in the past where a submitted patch failed to compile
	  because the submitter never tried it with the optimizations turned on.

	  To get the best of both worlds, COMPILE_DOUBLE has been split into its own
	  option.  If DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned on, COMPILE_DOUBLE will also be selected
	  BUT you can then turn it off if all you need are the debugging symbols.  This
	  way you have to make an informed decision about disabling COMPILE_DOUBLE.

	  To allow COMPILE_DOUBLE to be both auto-selected and turned off, a new feature
	  was added to menuselect.  The <use> element can now contain an "autoselect"
	  attribute which will turn the used member on but not create a hard dependency.
	  The cflags.xml implementation for COMPILE_DOUBLE looks like this...

	  <member name="DONT_OPTIMIZE" displayname="Disable Optimizations ...">
	  	<use autoselect="yes">COMPILE_DOUBLE</use>
	  	<support_level>core</support_level>
	  </member>
	  <member name="COMPILE_DOUBLE" displayname="Pre-compile with ...>
	  	<depend>DONT_OPTIMIZE</depend>
	  	<support_level>core</support_level>
	  </member>

	  When DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned on, COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned on because
	  of the use.
	  When DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned off, COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned off because
	  of the depend.
	  When COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned on, DONT_OPTIMIZE is turned on because
	  of the depend.
	  When COMPILE_DOUBLE is turned off, DONT_OPTIMIZE is left as is because
	  it only uses COMPILE_DOUBLE, it doesn't depend on it.

	  I also made a few tweaks to the ncurses implementation to move things
	  left a bit to allow longer descriptions.

	  The pjproject Makefile now uses the Asterisk optimization flags which
	  are determined by the setting of the DONT_OPTMIZE menuselect flag.
	  The Makefile was also restructured so a change to the top level
	  menuselect.makeopts will result in a rebuild of pjproject.

	  Also, "--disable-resample" was removed from the pjproject configure
	  options.  Without resample, pjsua (which is used by the testsuite)
	  can't make audio calls.  When it can't, it segfaults.

	* app_chanspy: Fix occasional deadlock with ChanSpy and Local channels.

	  Channel masquerading had a conflict with autochannel locking.

	  When locking autochannel->channel, the channel is fetched from the
	  autochannel and then locked. During the fetch, the autochannel -- which
	  has no locks itself -- can be modified by someone who owns the channel
	  lock. That means that the value of autochan->channel cannot be trusted
	  until you hold the lock.

	  In practice, this caused problems with Local channels getting
	  masqueraded away while the ChanSpy attempted to get info from that
	  channel. The old channel which was about to get removed got locked, but
	  the new (replaced) channel got unlocked (no-op). Because the replaced
	  channel was now locked (and would never get unlocked), it couldn't get
	  removed from the channel list in a timely manner, and would now cause
	  deadlocks when iterating over the channel list.

	  This change checks the autochannel after locking the channel for changes
	  to the autochannel. If the channel had been changed, the lock is
	  reobtained on the new channel.

	  In theory it seems possible that after this fix, the lock attempt on the
	  old (wrong) channel can be on an already destroyed lock, maybe causing
	  a crash. But that hasn't been observed in the wild and is harder induce
	  than the current deadlock.

	  Thanks go to Filip Frank for suggesting a fix similar to this and
	  especially to IRC user hexanol for pointing out why this deadlock was
	  possible and testing this fix. And to Richard for catching my rookie
	  while loop mistake ;)

	  Configurations like "aors = a, b, c" were either ignoring everything after "a"
	  or trying to look up " b".  Same for mailboxes,  ciphers, contacts and a few

	  To fix, all the strsep(&copy, ",") calls have been wrapped in ast_strip.  To
	  facilitate this, ast_strip, ast_skip_blanks and ast_skip_nonblanks were
	  updated to handle null pointers.

	  In some cases, an ast_strlen_zero() test was added to skip consecutive commas.

	  There was also an attempt to ast_free an ast_strdupa'd string in
	  ast_sip_for_each_aor which was causing a SEGV.  I removed it.

	  Although this issue was reported for realtime, the issue was in the res_pjsip
	  modules so all config mechanisms were affected.

	* loader: Retry dlopen when loading fails

	  Although we use the RTLD_LAZY flag when calling dlopen
	  the first time on a module, this only defers resolution
	  for function calls.  Pointer references to functions are
	  determined at link time so dlopen expects them to be there.
	  Since we don't cross-module link, pointers to functions
	  in other modules won't be available and dlopen will fail.

	  Doing a "hardened" build also causes problems because it
	  typically sets "-z now" on the ld command line which
	  overrides RTLD_LAZY at run time.

	  If the failing module isn't a GLOBAL_SYMBOLS module, then
	  dlopen will be called again after all the GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
	  modules have been loaded and they'll eventually resolve.

	  If the calling module IS a GLOBAL_SYMBOLS module itself
	  and a third module depends on it, then there's an issue
	  because the second time through the dlopen loop,
	  GLOBAL_SYMBOLS modules aren't given any special treatment
	  and since the order in which dlopen is called isn't
	  deterministic, the dependent may again be tried before the
	  module it needs is loaded.

	  Simple solution:  Save modules that fail load_resource
	  because of a dlopen error in a list and retry them
	  immediately after the first pass. Keep retrying until
	  the failed list is empty or we reach a #defined max
	  retries. Error messages are suppressed until the final
	  pass which also gets rid of those confusing error messages
	  about module failures that are later corrected.

	* bridge.c: Crash during attended transfer when missing a local channel half

	  It's possible for the transferer channel to get hung up early during the
	  attended transfer process. For instance, a phone may send a "bye" immediately
	  upon receiving a sip notify that contains a sip frag 100 (I'm looking at you
	  Jitsi). When this occurs a race begins between the transferer being hung up
	  and completion of the transfer code.

	  If the channel hangs up too early during a transfer involving stasis bridging
	  for instance, then when the created local channel goes to look up its swap
	  channel (and associated datastore) it can't find it (since it is no longer in
	  the bridge) thus it fails to enter the stasis application. Consequently, the
	  created local channel(s) hang up as well. If the timing is just right then the
	  bridging code attempts to add the message link with missing local channel(s).
	  Hence the crash.

	  Unfortunately, there is no great way to solve the problem of the unexpected
	  "bye". While we can't guarantee we won't receive an early hangup, and in this
	  case still fail to enter the stasis application, we can make it so asterisk
	  does not crash.

	  This patch does just that by locking the local channel structure, checking
	  that the local channel's peer has not been lost, and then continuing. This
	  keeps the local channel's peer from being ripped out from underneath it by
	  the local/unreal hangup code while attempting to set the stasis message link.

	* res_pjsip_refer.c: Delay sending the initial SIP Notify with frag 100

	  During the transfer process, some phones (okay it was the Jitsi softphone,
	  but maybe others are out there) send a "bye" immediately after receiving a
	  SIP Notify. When a "bye" is received early for some types of transfers the
	  transferer channel may no longer be available during late stage transfer
	  processing.

	  For instance, during an attended transfer involving stasis bridging at one
	  point the created local channel looks for an associated swap channel in
	  order to retrieve the stasis application name. If the transferer has hung
	  up then the local channel will fail to find it. The local channel then has
	  no way to know which stasis app to enter, so it fails and hangs up as well.
	  Thus the transfer does not complete as expected.

	  This patch delays the sending of the initial notify in order to give the
	  transfer process enough time to gather the necessary data for a successful
	  transfer.

	* alembic: Fix downgrade and tweak for sqlite

	  Downgrade had a few issues.  First there was an errant 'update' statement in
	  add_auto_dtmf_mode that looks like it was a copy/paste error.  Second, we
	  weren't cleaning up the ENUMs so subsequent upgrades on postgres failed
	  because the types already existed.

	  For sqlite...  sqlite doesn't support ALTER or DROP COLUMN directly.
	  Fortunately alembic batch_operations takes care of this for us if we
	  use it so the alter and drops were converted to use batch operations.

	  Here's an example downgrade:

	      with op.batch_alter_table('ps_endpoints') as batch_op:
	          batch_op.drop_column('tos_audio')
	          batch_op.drop_column('tos_video')
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('tos_audio', yesno_values))
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('tos_video', yesno_values))
	          batch_op.drop_column('cos_audio')
	          batch_op.drop_column('cos_video')
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('cos_audio', yesno_values))
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('cos_video', yesno_values))

	      with op.batch_alter_table('ps_transports') as batch_op:
	          batch_op.drop_column('tos')
	          batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('tos', yesno_values))
	      # Can't cast integers to YESNO_VALUES, so dropping and adding is required

	* SIP diversion: Fix REDIRECTING(reason) value inconsistencies.

	  Previous chan_sip behavior:

	  Before this patch chan_sip would always strip any quotes from an incoming
	  reason and pass that value up as the REDIRECTING(reason).  For an outgoing
	  reason value, chan_sip would check the value against known values and
	  quote any it didn't recognize.  Incoming 480 response message reason text
	  was just assigned to the REDIRECTING(reason).

	  Previous chan_pjsip behavior:

	  Before this patch chan_pjsip would always pass the incoming reason value
	  up as the REDIRECTING(reason).  For an outgoing reason value, chan_pjsip
	  would send the reason value as passed down.

	  With this patch:

	  Both channel drivers match incoming reason values with values documented
	  by REDIRECTING(reason) and values documented by RFC5806 regardless of
	  whether they are quoted or not.  RFC5806 values are mapped to the
	  equivalent REDIRECTING(reason) documented value and is set in
	  REDIRECTING(reason).  e.g., an incoming RFC5806 'unconditional' value or a
	  quoted string version ('"unconditional"') is converted to
	  REDIRECTING(reason)'s 'cfu' value.  The user's dialplan only needs to deal
	  with 'cfu' instead of any of the aliases.

	  The incoming 480 response reason text supported by chan_sip checks for
	  known reason values and if not matched then puts quotes around the reason
	  string and assigns that to REDIRECTING(reason).

	  Both channel drivers send outgoing known REDIRECTING(reason) values as the
	  unquoted RFC5806 equivalent.  User custom values are either sent as is or
	  with added quotes if SIP doesn't allow a character within the value as
	  part of a RFC3261 Section 25.1 token.  Note that there are still
	  limitations on what characters can be put in a custom user value.  e.g.,
	  embedding quotes in the middle of the reason string is silly and just
	  going to cause you grief.

	  * Setting a REDIRECTING(reason) value now recognizes RFC5806 aliases.
	  e.g., Setting REDIRECTING(reason) to 'unconditional' is converted to the
	  'cfu' value.

	  * Added missing malloc() NULL return check in res_pjsip_diversion.c
	  set_redirecting_reason().

	  * Fixed potential read from a stale pointer in res_pjsip_diversion.c
	  add_diversion_header().  The reason string needed to be copied into the
	  tdata memory pool to ensure that the string would always be available.
	  Otherwise, if the reason string returned by reason_code_to_str() was a
	  user's reason string then the string could be freed later by another
	  thread.

	* build-system: Allow building with static pjproject

	  Background here:
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2016-January/075266.html

	  From CHANGES:
	   * To help insure that Asterisk is compiled and run with the same known
	     version of pjproject, a new option (--with-pjproject-bundled) has been
	     added to ./configure.  When specified, the version of pjproject specified
	     in third-party/versions.mak will be downloaded and configured.  When you
	     make Asterisk, the build process will also automatically build pjproject
	     and Asterisk will be statically linked to it.  Once a particular version
	     of pjproject is configured and built, it won't be configured or built
	     again unless you run a 'make distclean'.

	     To facilitate testing, when 'make install' is run, the pjsua and pjsystest
	     utilities and the pjproject python bindings will be installed in
	     ASTDATADIR/third-party/pjproject.

	     The default behavior remains building with the shared pjproject
	     installation, if any.

	  Building:

	     All you have to do is include the --with-pjproject-bundled option on
	     the ./configure command line (and remove any existing --with-pjproject
	     option if specified).  Everything else is automatic.

	  Behind the scenes:

	     The top-level Makefile was modified to include 'third-party' in the
	     list of MOD_SUBDIRS.

	     The third-party directory was created to contain any third party
	     packages that may be needed in the future.  Its Makefile automatically
	     iterates over any subdirectories passing on targets.

	     The third-party/pjproject directory was created to house the pjproject
	     source distribution.  Its Makefile contains targets to download, patch
	     configure, generate dependencies, compile libs, apps and python bindings,
	     sanitized build.mak and generate a symbols list.

	     When bootstrap.sh is run, it automatically includes the configure.m4
	     file in third-party/pjproject.  This file has a macro to download and
	     conifgure pjproject and get and set PJPROJECT_INCLUDE, PJPROJECT_DIR
	     and PJPROJECT_BUNDLED.  It also tests for the capabilities like
	     PJ_TRANSACTION_GRP_LOCK by parsing preprocessor output as opposed to
	     trying to compile.  Of course, bootstrap.sh is only run once and the
	     configure file is incldued in the patch.

	     When configure is run with the new options, the macro in configure.m4
	     triggers the download, patch, conifgure and tests.  No compilation is
	     performed at this time.  The downloaded tarball is cached in /tmp so
	     it doesn't get downloaded again on a distclean.

	     When make is run in the top-level Asterisk source directory, it will
	     automatically descend all the subdirectories in third_party just as it
	     does for addons, apps, etc.  The top-level Makefile makes sure that
	     the 'third-party' is built before 'main' so that dependencies from the
	     other directories are built first.

	     When main does build, a new shared library (libasteriskpj) is created that
	     links statically to the pjproject .a files and exports all their symbols.
	     The asterisk binary links to that, just as it does with libasteriskssl.

	     When Asterisk is installed, the pjsua and pjsystest apps, and the pjproject
	     python bindings are installed in ASTDATADIR/third-party/pjproject.  This
	     will facilitate testing, including running the testsuite which will be
	     updated to check that directory for the pjsua module ahead of the system
	     python library.

	  Modules should continue to depend on pjproject if they use pjproject APIs
	  directly.  They should not care about the implementation.  No changes to any
	  res_pjsip modules were made.

	* chan_sip.c: Fix T.38 issues caused by leaving a bridge.

	  chan_sip could not handle AST_T38_TERMINATED frames being sent to it when
	  the channel left the bridge.  The action resulted in overlapping outgoing
	  reINVITEs.  The testsuite tests/fax/sip/directmedia_reinvite_t38 was not
	  happy.

	  * Force T.38 to be remembered as locally bridged.  Now when the channel
	  leaves the native RTP bridge after T.38, the channel remembers that it has
	  already reINVITEed the media back to Asterisk.  It just needs to terminate
	  T.38 when the AST_T38_TERMINATED arrives.

	  * Prevent redundant AST_T38_TERMINATED from causing problems.  Redundant
	  AST_T38_TERMINATED frames could cause overlapping outgoing reINVITEs if
	  they happen before the T.38 state changes to disabled.  Now the T.38 state
	  is set to disabled before the reINVITE is sent.

	  that it puts into the bridge may or may not be processed by the time the
	  bridged peer is kicked out of the bridge.  If it is processed then all is
	  well.  However, if it is not processed then that channel is stuck in fax
	  mode until it hangs up or maybe if it joins another bridge for T.38
	  faxing.

	* bridge_channel: Don't settle owed events on an optimization.

	  Local channel optimization could cause DTMF digits to be duplicated.
	  Pending DTMF end events would be posted to a bridge when the local channel
	  optimizes out and is replaced by the channel further down the chain.  When
	  the real digit ends, the channel would get another DTMF end posted to the
	  bridge.

	  A -- LocalA;1/n -- LocalA;2/n -- LocalB;1 -- LocalB;2 -- B

	  1) LocalA has the /n flag to prevent optimization.
	  2) B is sending DTMF to A through the local channel chain.
	  3) When LocalB optimizes out it can move B to the position of LocalB;1
	  4) Without this patch, when B swaps with LocalB;1 then LocalB;1 would
	  settle an owed DTMF end to the bridge toward LocalA;2.
	  5) When B finally ends its DTMF it sends the DTMF end down the chain.
	  6) Without this patch, A would hear the DTMF digit end when LocalB
	  optimizes out and when B ends the original digit.

	* sorcery:  Refactor create, update and delete to better deal with caches

	  The ast_sorcery_create, update and delete function have been refactored
	  to better deal with caches and errors.

	  The action is now called on all non-caching wizards first. If ANY succeed,
	  the action is called on all caching wizards and the observers are notified.
	  This way we don't put something in the cache (or update or delete) before
	  knowing the action was performed in at least 1 backend and we only call the
	  observers once even if there were multiple writable backends.

	  ast_sorcery_create was never adding to caches in the first place which
	  was preventing contacts from getting added to a memory_cache when they
	  were created.  In turn this was causing memory_cache to emit errors if
	  the contact was deleted before being retrieved (which would have
	  populated the cache).

	  The 'reload' mechanism actually involves closing the underlying

	  to reset the transport before sending requests to insure that the
	  pjsip transport didn't get pulled out from under them.

	  In my testing, no calls were dropped when a transport was changed
	  for any of the 3 transport types even if ip addresses or ports were
	  changed. To be on the safe side however, a new transport option was
	  added (allow_reload) which defaults to 'no'.  Unless it's explicitly
	  set to 'yes' for a transport, changes to that transport will be ignored
	  on a reload of res_pjsip.  This should preserve the current behavior.

	* res_pjproject:  Add ability to map pjproject log levels to Asterisk log levels

	  Warnings and errors in the pjproject libraries are generally handled by
	  Asterisk.  In many cases, Asterisk wouldn't even consider them to be warnings
	  or errors so the messages emitted by pjproject directly are either superfluous
	  or misleading.  A good exampe of this are the level-0 errors pjproject emits
	  when it can't open a TCP/TLS socket to a client to send an OPTIONS.  We don't
	  consider a failure to qualify a UDP client an "ERROR", why should a TCP/TLS
	  client be treated any differently?

	  A config file for res_pjproject has bene added (pjproject.conf) and a new
	  log_mappings object allows mapping pjproject levels to Asterisk levels
	  (or nothing).  The defaults if no pjproject.conf file is found are the same
	  as those that were hard-coded into res_pjproject initially: 0,1 = LOG_ERROR,
	  2 = LOG_WARNING, 3,4,5 = LOG_DEBUG<level>

	* Fix failing threadpool_auto_increment test.

	  The threadpool_auto_increment test fails infrequently for a couple of
	  reasons
	  * The threadpool listener was notified of fewer tasks being pushed than
	    were actually pushed
	  * The "was_empty" flag was set to an unexpected value.

	  The problem is that the test pushes three tasks into the threadpool.
	  Test expects the threadpool to essentially gather those three tasks, and
	  then distribute those to the threadpool threads. It also expects that as
	  the tasks are pushed in, the threadpool listener is alerted immediately
	  that the tasks have been pushed. In reality, a task can be distributed
	  to the threadpool threads quicker than expected, meaning that the
	  threadpool has already emptied by the time each subsequent task is
	  pushed. In addition, the internal threadpool queue can be delayed so
	  that the threadpool listener is not alerted that a task has been pushed
	  even after the task has been executed.

	  From the test's point of view, there's no way to be able to predict
	  exactly the order that task execution/listener notifications will occur,
	  and there is no way to know which listener notifications will indicate
	  that the threadpool was previously empty.

	  For this reason, the test has been updated to only check the things it
	  can check. It ensures that all tasks get executed, that the threads go
	  idle after the tasks are executed, and that the listener is told the
	  proper number of tasks that were pushed.

	* res_pjsip_caller_id: Fix segfault when replacing rpid or pai header

	  If the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function adds a PAI or RPID header and send_rpid
	  or send_pai is set, res_pjsip_caller_id attemps to retrieve, parse and modify
	  the header added by the dialplan function.  Since the header added by the
	  dialplan function is generic string, there are no virtual functions to parse
	  the uri and we get a segfault when we try.  Since the modify, was really only
	  an overwrite, we now just delete the old header if it was type PJSIP_H_OTHER
	  and recreate it.

	  This raises a question for another time though:  What should happen with
	  duplicate headers?  Right now res_pjsip_header_funcs doesn't check for dups
	  so if it's session supplement is loaded after res_pjsip_caller_id's (or any
	  other module that adds headers), there'll be dups in the message.

	* Fix creation race of contact_status structures.

	  It is possible when processing a SIP REGISTER request to have two
	  threads end up creating contact_status structures in sorcery.
	  contact_status is created using a "find or create" function. If two
	  threads call into this at the same time, each thread will fail to find
	  an existing contact_status, and so both will end up creating a new
	  contact status.

	  During testing, we would see sporadic failures because the
	  PJSIP_CONTACT() dialplan function would operate on a different
	  contact_status than what had been updated by res_pjsip/pjsip_options.

	  The fix here is two-fold:
	  1) The "find or create" function for contact_status now has a lock
	  around the entire operation. This way, if two threads attempt the
	  operation simultaneously, the first to get there will create the object,
	  and the second will find the object created by the first thread.

	  2) res_sorcery_memory has had its create callback updated so that it
	  will not allow for objects with duplicate IDs to be created.

	  This change makes it so the subscription tree is fully set up before it is
	  added to the list of subscriptions. This ensures that when the listing actions
	  get the subscription it is valid.

	* tests/test_sorcery_memory_cache_thrash: Improve termination process.

	  When terminating the threads thrashing a sorcery memory cache each
	  would be told to stop and then we would wait on them. During at
	  least one thrashing test this was problematic due to the specific
	  usage pattern in use. It would take some time for termination of the
	  thread to occur.

	  This would occur due to contention between the threads retrieving
	  and the threads updating the cache. As the retrieving threads are
	  given priority it may be some time before the updating threads
	  are able to proceed.

	  This change makes it so all threads are told to stop and then each
	  are joined to ensure they stop. This way all the threads should
	  stop at around the same time instead of waiting for one to stop,
	  the next to stop, then the next, and so on. As a result of this
	  the execution time for each thrash test is much closer to their
	  expected value than previously seen as well.

	* res_pjsip:  Fix infinite recursion when loading transports from realtime

	  Attempting to load a transport from realtime was forcing asterisk into an
	  infinite recursion loop.  The first thing transport_apply did was to do a
	  sorcery retrieve by id for an existing transport of the same name. For files,
	  this just returns the previous object from res_sorcery_config's internal
	  container, if any.  For realtime, the res_sourcery_realtime driver looks in the
	  database and finds the existing row but now it has to rehydrate it into a
	  sorcery object which means calling... transport_apply.  And so it goes.

	  The main issue with loading from realtime (apart from the loop) was that
	  transport stores structures and pointers directly in the ast_sip_transport
	  structure instead of the separate ast_transport_state structure.  This patch
	  separates those items into the ast_sip_transport_state structure.  The pattern
	  is roughly the same as res_pjsip_outbound_registration.

	  Although all current usages of ast_sip_transport and ast_sip_transport_state
	  were modified to use the new ast_sip_get_transport_state API, the original
	  items are left in ast_sip_transport and kept updated to maintain ABI
	  compatability for third-party modules.  They are marked as deprecated and
	  noted that they're now in ast_sip_transport_state.

	* build_system: Prevent goals needing makeopts from running when it's missing

	  The Makefile only optionally includes makeopts so when goals like uninstall that
	  dont depend on anything else are run after a distclean, rules like
	  'rm -f "$(DESTDIR)$(ASTMODDIR)/"*' get run as 'rm -f ""/*' which attempts
	  to remove everything in the root directory.

	  Although there's a rule defined for makeopts which prints a message and does
	  an 'exit 1', since '-include makepopts' was specified (with the -), the exit
	  was ignored letting the rest of the rules run.

	  This patch makes makeopts required unless the goal has the string 'clean' in it.

	* config: Allow options to register when documentation is unavailable.

	  The config options framework is strict in that configuration options must
	  be documented unless XML documentation support is not available. In
	  practice this is useful as it ensures documentation exists however in
	  off-nominal cases this can cause strange problems.

	  If it is expected that a config option has a non-zero or non-empty
	  default value but the config option documentation is unavailable
	  this reasonable expectation will not be met. This can cause obscure
	  crashes and weirdness depending on how the code handles it.

	  This change tweaks the behavior to ensure that the config option
	  is still allowed to register, apply default values, and be set when
	  devmode is not enabled. If devmode is enabled then the option can
	  NOT be set.

	  This also does not remove the initial documentation error message that
	  is output on load when registering the configuration option.

	* Stasis: Use custom structure when setting variables.

	  A recent change to queue channel variable setting to the Stasis control
	  queue caused a regression. When setting channel variables, it is
	  possible to give a NULL channel variable value in order to unset the
	  variable (i.e. remove it from the channel variable list). The change
	  introduced a call to ast_variable_new(), which is not tolerant of NULL
	  channel variable values.

	  This new change switches from using ast_variable to using a custom
	  channel variable struct that is lighter weight and NULL value-tolerant.

	  A test recently uncovered that running an ill-timed AMI command to show
	  inbound subscriptions could cause a crash since Asterisk will try to

	  The fix for this is to remove the subscription tree from the list of

	  inaccessible from AMI.

	* Stasis: Fix potential memory leak of control data.

	  When queuing tasks onto the Stasis control queue, you can pass an
	  arbitrary data pointer and a function to free that data. All ARI
	  commands that use the Stasis control queue made the assumption that the
	  destructor function would be called in all paths, whether the task was
	  queued successfully or not. However, this was not correct. If a task was
	  queued onto a control structure that was already completed, the
	  allocated data would not be freed properly.

	  This patch corrects this by making sure that all return paths call the
	  data destructor.

	* Stasis: Use control queue to prevent crash.

	  A crash occurred when attempting to set a channel variable on a channel
	  that had already been hung up. This is because there is a small window
	  between when a control is grabbed and when the channel variable is set
	  that the channel can be hung up.

	  The fix here is to queue the setting of the channel variable onto the
	  control queue. This way, the manipulation of the channel happens in a
	  thread where it is safe to be done.

	  In this change, I also noticed that the setting of bridge roles on
	  channels was being done outside of the control queue, so I also changed
	  those operations to be done in the control queue.

	* res_odbc: Remove connection management

	  Asterisk by default will create a single database connection and share
	  it among all threads that attempt to access the database. In previous
	  versions of Asterisk, this was tolerable, because the most used channel
	  driver, chan_sip, mostly accessed the database from a single thread.
	  With PJSIP, however, many threads may be attempting to perform database
	  operations, and there is the potential for many more database accesses,
	  meaning the concurrency is a horrible bottleneck if only one connection
	  is shared.

	  Asterisk has a connection pooling facility built into it, but the
	  implementation has flaws. For one, there is a strict limit on the number
	  of simultaneous connections that could be made to the database. Anything
	  beyond the maximum would result in a failed operation. Attempting to
	  predict what the maximum should be is nearly impossible even for someone
	  intimately familiar with Asterisk's threading model. In addition, use of
	  transactions in the dialplan can cause some severe bugs if connection
	  pooling is enabled.

	  This commit seeks to fix the concurrency problem by removing all
	  connection management code from Asterisk and leaving that to the
	  underlying unixODBC code instead. Now, Asterisk does not share a single
	  connection, nor does it try to maintain a connection pool. Instead, all
	  Asterisk ever does is request a connection from unixODBC and allow
	  unixODBC to either allocate those connections or retrieve them from a
	  pool.

	  Doing this has a bit of a ripple effect. For one, since connections are
	  not long-lived objects, several of the safeguards that previously
	  existed have been removed. We don't have to worry about trying to use a
	  connection that has gone stale. In every case, when we request a
	  connection, it has just been made and we don't need to perform any
	  sanity checks to be sure it's still active.

	  Another major player affected by this change is transactions.
	  Transactions and their respective connections were so tightly coupled
	  that it was almost pornographic. This code change moves
	  transaction-related code to its own file separate from the core ODBC
	  functionality. This way, the core of ODBC does not even have to know
	  that transactions exist.

	  In making this large change, I had to look at a lot of code and
	  understand it. When making this change, I discovered several places
	  where the behavior is definitely not ideal, but it seemed outside the
	  scope of this change to be fixing it. Instead, any place where I saw
	  some sort of room for improvement has had a XXX comment added explaining
	  what could be altered to improve it.

	* app: Queue hangup if channel is hung up during sub or macro execution.

	  This issue was exposed when executing a connected line subroutine.
	  When connected or redirected subroutines or macros are executed it is
	  expected that the underlying applications and logic invoked are fast
	  and do not consume frames. In practice this constraint is not enforced
	  and if not adhered to will cause channels to continue when they shouldn't.
	  This is because each caller of the connected or redirected logic does not
	  check whether the channel has been hung up on return. As a result the
	  the hung up channel continues.

	  This change makes it so when the API to execute a subroutine or
	  macro is invoked the channel is checked to determine if it has hung up.
	  If it has then a hangup is queued again so the caller will see it
	  and stop.

	* res_musiconhold: Prevent multiple simultaneous reloads.

	  There are two ways in which the reload() function in res_musiconhold can be
	  called from the CLI:

	    * module reload res_musiconhold.so
	    * moh reload

	  In the former case, the module loader holds a lock that prevents multiple
	  concurrent calls, but in the latter there is no such protection.

	  This patch changes the 'moh reload' CLI command to invoke the module loader
	  directly, rather than call reload() explicitly.

	* res_sorcery_realtime: Remove leading ^ requirement.

	  res_sorcery_realtime's search-by-regex callback performed a check to
	  ensure that the passed-in regex began with a caret (^). If it did not,
	  then no results would be returned.

	  This callback only started to become used when "like" support was added
	  to PJSIP CLI commands. The CLI command for listing objects would pass an
	  empty regex ("") to the sorcery backend if no "like" statement was
	  present. For most sorcery backends, this resulted in returning all
	  objects. However, for realtime, this resulted in returning no objects.

	  This commit seeks to fix the regression by removing the requirement from
	  res_sorcery_realtime for the passed-in-regex to begin with a caret.

	* pjsip_sdp_rtp:  Add option endpoint/bind_rtp_to_media_address

	  On a system with multiple ip addresses in the same subnet, if a
	  transport is bound to a specific ip address and endpoint/media_address
	   is set, the SIP/SDP will have the correct address in all fields but
	  the rtp stream MAY still originate from one of the other ip addresses,
	  most probably the "primary" ip address.  This happens because
	   res_pjsip_sdp_rtp/create_rtp always calls ast_instance_new with
	  the "all" ip address (0.0.0.0 or ::).

	  The new option causes res_pjsip_sdp_rtp/create_rtp to call
	  ast_rtp_instance_new with the endpoint's media_address (if specified)
	  instead of the "all" address.  This causes the packets to originate from
	  the specified address.

	* pbx: Deadlock between contexts container and context_merge locks

	  Recent changes (ASTERISK-25394 commit 2bd27d12223fe33b58c453965ed5c6ed3af7c4f5)
	  introduced the possibility of a deadlock. Due to the mentioned modifications
	  ast_change_hints now needs to keep both merge/delete and state callbacks from
	  occurring while it executes. Unfortunately, sometimes ast_change_hints can be
	  called with the contexts container locked. When this happens it's possible for
	  another thread to grab the context_merge_lock before the thread calling into
	  ast_change_hints does and then try to obtain the contexts container lock. This
	  of course causes a deadlock between the two threads. The thread calling into
	  ast_change_hints waits for the other thread to release context_merge_lock and
	  the other thread is waiting on that one to release the contexts container lock.

	  Unfortunately, there is not a great way to fix this problem. When hints change,
	  the subsequent state callbacks cannot run at the same time as a merge/delete,
	  nor when the usual state callbacks do. This patch alleviates the problem by
	  having those particular callbacks (the ones run after a hint change) occur in a
	  serialized task. By moving the context_merge_lock to a task it can now safely be
	  attempted or held without a deadlock occurring.

	  This reverts commit 0a9941de9d24093b5ff44096d1d7406f29d11e45.

	  Matt,

	  This patch causes another problem and should not have been needed.
	  Before this patch, persistent_endpoint_contact_deleted_observer WAS
	  deleting the contact_status when ast_sip_location_delete_contact was
	  called.  By deleting it yourself in ast_sip_location_delete_contact
	  it was gone before the observer could run and the observer therefore
	  was throwing an error and not sending stasis/AMI/statsd messages.

	  So, I don't think this was the cause of your original issue.  I also
	  had verified the contact AMI and statsd lifecycle and it was working.
	  I'll double check now though.

	* PJSIP: Prevent deadlock due to dialog/transaction lock inversion.

	  A deadlock was observed where the monitor thread was stuck, therefore
	  resulting in no incoming SIP traffic being processed.

	  The problem occurred when two 200 OK responses arrived in response to a
	  terminating NOTIFY request sent from Asterisk. The first 200 OK was
	  dispatched to a threadpool worker, who locked the corresponding
	  transaction. The second 200 OK arrived, resulting in the monitor thread
	  locking the dialog. At this point, the two threads are at odds, because
	  the monitor thread attempts to lock the transaction, and the threadpool
	  thread loops attempting to try to lock the dialog.

	  In this case, the fix is to not have the monitor thread attempt to hold
	  both the dialog and transaction locks at the same time. Instead, we
	  release the dialog lock before attempting to lock the transaction.

	  There have also been some debug messages added to the process in an
	  attempt to make it more clear what is going on in the process.

	* voicemail: Move app_voicemail / res_mwi_external conflict to runtime

	  The menuselect conflict between app_voicemail and res_mwi_external
	  makes it hard to package 1 version of Asterisk.  There no actual
	  build dependencies between the 2 so moving this check to runtime
	  seems like a better solution.

	  The ast_vm_register and ast_vm_greeter_register functions in app.c
	  were modified to return AST_MODULE_LOAD_DECLINE instead of -1 if there
	  is already a voicemail module registered. The modules' load_module
	  functions were then modified to return DECLINE instead of -1 to the
	  loader.  Since -1 is interpreted by the loader as AST_MODULE_LOAD_FAILURE,
	  the modules were incorrectly causing Asterisk to stop so this needed
	  to be cleaned up anyway.

	  Now you can build both and use modules.conf to decide which voicemail
	  implementation to load.

	  The default menuselect options still build app_voicemail and not
	  res_mwi_external but if both ARE built, res_mwi_external will load
	  first and become the voicemail provider unless modules.conf rules
	  prevent it.  This is noted in CHANGES.

	* app_dial: Immediately exit dial if the caller is already hung up.

	  If a caller hangs up before dial is executed within an AGI then the AGI
	  has likely eaten all queued frames before executing the dial in DeadAGI
	  mode.  With the caller hung up and no pending frames from the caller's
	  read queue, dial would not know that the call has hung up until a called
	  channel answers.  It is rather annoying to whoever just answered the
	  non-existent call.

	  Dial should not continue execution in DeadAGI mode, hangup handlers, or
	  the h exten.

	  * Added a check early in dial to abort dialing if the caller has hungup.

	* main/cdr: Allow setting properties on a finalized CDR if it is the last one

	  Prior to this patch, we explicitly disallowed setting any properties on a
	  finalized CDR. This seemed like a good idea at the time; in practice, it was
	  more restrictive.

	  There are weird and strange scenarios where setting a property on a finalized
	  CDR is definitely wrong. For example, we may Fork a CDR, finalizing the
	  previous one, then change a property. In said case, the old CDR is supposed
	  to now be 'immutable' (so to speak), and should not be updated. From the
	  perspective of the code, a forked CDR that is finalized is just finalized.
	  Hence why we decided these should not be updated.

	  In practice, it is much more common to want to set a property on a CDR in
	  the h extension or in a hangup handler. Disallowing a common scenario to make
	  an esoteric behaviour work isn't good. This patch fixes this by allowing
	  callers to set a property IF we are the last CDR in the chain. This preserves
	  the finalized CDR if it was forked, while allowing the more common case to
	  function.

	* main/cdr: Set the end time on a CDR if endbeforehexten is Yes

	  Prior to this patch, the CDR engine attempted to set the end time on a CDR
	  that was executing hangup logic and with endbeforehexten set to Yes by
	  calling a function that inspects the properties on the Party A snapshot to
	  determine if we are ready to set the end time. That always failed. This is
	  because a Party A snapshot is not updated for CDRs that are executing hangup
	  logic with endbeforehexten=Yes.

	  Instead of calling a function that looks at the Party A snapshot, we just
	  simply set the end time on the CDR. This is safe to call multiple times, and is
	  safe to call at this point as we know that (a) we are executing hangup logic,
	  and (b) we are supposed to set the end time at this point.

	* res_pjsip_history: Add a module that provides PJSIP history for debugging

	  This patch adds a new module, res_pjsip_history, that provides a slightly
	  better way of debugging SIP message traffic on a busy Asterisk system. The
	  existing mechanisms all rely on passively dumping a SIP message to the CLI.
	  While this is perfectly fine for logging purposes and well controlled
	  environments, on many installations, the amount of SIP messages Asterisk
	  receives will quickly swamp the CLI. This makes it difficult to view/capture
	  those messages that you want to diagnose in real time.

	  This patch provides another way of handling this. When enabled, the module
	  will store SIP message traffic in memory. This traffic can then be queried
	  at leisure.

	  In order to make the querying useful, a CLI command has been implemented,
	  'pjsip show history', that supports a basic expression syntax similar to
	  SQL or other query languages. A small number of useful fields have been
	  added in this initial patch; additional fields can easily be added in
	  later improvements. Those fields are:
	   - number: The entry index in the history
	   - timestamp: The time the message was recieved
	   - addr: The source/destination address of the message
	   - sip.msg.request.method: The request method
	   - sip.msg.call-id: The Call-ID header

	  Note - this is a resurrection of the module initially proposed on Review Board
	  here: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4053/

	* test_time: Provide a timeout when waiting.

	* res_http_websocket.c: prevent avoidable disconnections caused by write errors

	  Updated ast_websocket_write to encode the entire frame in to one
	  write operation, to ensure that we don't end up with a situation
	  where the websocket header has been sent, while the body can not
	  be written.

	  Previous to August's patch in commit b9bd3c14, certain network
	  conditions could cause the header to be written, and then the
	  sub-sequent body to fail - which would cause the next successful
	  write to contain a new header, and a new body (resulting in
	  the peer receiving two headers - the second of which would be
	  read as part of the body for the first header).

	  This was patched to have both write operations individually fail
	  by closing the websocket.

	  In a case available to the submitter of this patch, the same
	  body which would consistently fail to write, would succeed
	  if written at the same time as the header.

	  This update merges the two operations in to one, adds debug messages
	  indicating the reason for a websocket connection being closed during
	  a write operation, and clarifies some variable names for code legibility.

	* endpoint/stasis: Eliminate duplicate events on endpoint status change

	  When an endpoint is created, its messages are forwarded to both the tech
	  endpoint topic and the all endpoints topic. This is done so that various
	  parties interested in endpoint messages can subscribe to just the tech
	  endpoint and receive all messages associated with that particular technology,
	  as opposed to subscribing to the all endpoints topic. Unfortunately, when the
	  tech endpoint is created, it also forwards all of its messages to the all
	  topic. This results in duplicate messages whenever an endpoint publishes its
	  messages.

	  This patch resolves the duplicate message issue by creating a new function
	  for Stasis caching topics, stasis_cp_sink_create. In most respects, this acts
	  as a normal caching topic, save that it no longer forwards messages it receives
	  to the all endpoints topic. This allows it to act as an aggregation "sink",
	  while preserving the necessary caching behaviour.

	* chan_sip: option 'notifyringing' change and doc fix

	  In the sample sip.conf this is written with regard to notifyringing:
	  ;notifyringing = no ; Control whether subscriptions already INUSE get sent
	  RINGING when another call is sent (default: yes)

	  However, this setting changes whether or not any RINGING indications are sent
	  to subscriptions. There is no separate configurable setting that allows
	  to control whether INUSE subscriptions also get sent RINGING. This is however
	  a useful option, to see (using BLF) if somebody else is able to handle an
	  incoming call or if everybody is busy.

	  This patch corrects the documentation for notifyringing (so the documentation
	  matches the functionality) and make notifyringing a tri-state option, by adding
	  the value 'notinuse' (in addition to 'yes' and 'no'). When notifyringing =
	  notinuse, only subscriptions that are not INUSE are sent the RINGING signal.

	  The default setting for notifyringing remains set to yes, so the default
	  behaviour is not affected.

	* chan_sip.c: fix websocket_write_timeout default value

	  websocket_write_timeout was not being set to its default value
	  during sip config reload, which meant that prior to this commit,
	  1) the default value of 100 was not used, unless an invalid value
	  (or 1) was specified in sip.conf for websocket_write_timeout, and
	  2) if the websocket_write_timeout directive was removed from sip.conf
	  without a full restart of asterisk, then the previous value would
	  continue to be used indefinitely.

	  This essentially lead to a 0ms write timeout (the first write attempt
	  in ast_careful_fwrite must have succeeded) in websocket write requests
	  from chan_sip, unless websocket_write_timeout was explicitely set in sip.conf.

	  Changes to websocket_write_timeout still only apply to new websocket
	  sessions, after the sip reload -- timeouts on existing sessions are
	  not adjusted during sip reload.

	* res/res_pjsip_location: Delete contact_status object when contact is deleted

	  In 450579e908, a change was made that removed the deletion of the
	  'contact_status' object when a 'contact' object is deleted in sorcery.
	  This unfortunately means that the 'contact_status' object persists, even when
	  something has explicitly removed a contact. The result is that the state of
	  the contact will not be regenerated if that contact is re-created, and the
	  stale state will be reported/used for that contact. It also results in
	  no ContactStatusChanged events being generated for either ARI or AMI.

	* res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix DTLS negotiation delays.

	  - Trigger pending DTLS packets to send out, once the RTP instance's remote
	    address is set.
	  - Avoids locking the DTLS structure unnecessarily by only doing this if
	    DTLS is passive.
	  - Add DTLS locks around the structurally sensitive calls in the SSL
	    portion of __rtp_recvfrom, since dtls_srtp_check_pending does not lock
	    inside of itself, and we're dealing with the SSL BIO in at least two
	    threads.

	  WebRTC channels may receive a DTLS handshake before
	  ast_rtp_remote_address_set is called, which causes there to be a pending
	  response to send out.   Previous to 1ad827, this was handled by calling
	  dtls_srtp_check_pending on receipt of any RTP packet - a STUN or RTP
	  packet could trigger the pending handshake response.  Since that was
	  rightfully removed, whenever the DTLS handshake is received before the
	  remote address is set, we would have to wait until another SSL packet
	  arrives.

	  As of Chrome M47's optimizations to their handshake process, WebRTC
	  conversations between Chrome M47+ and Asterisk, where Asterisk is passive,
	  experience a 1 second delay without this patch, because the SSL handshake
	  is received before ICE negotation stores the remote_address, and the next
	  SSL packet isn't received until after a 1 second timeout in Chrome, which
	  causes a new handshake request.

	* main/utils: Don't emit an ERROR message if the read end of a pipe closes

	  An ERROR or WARNING message should generally indicate that something has gone
	  wrong in Asterisk. In the case of writing to a file descriptor, Asterisk is not
	  in control of when the far end closes its reading on a file descriptor. If the
	  far end does close the file descriptor in an unclean fashion, this isn't a bug
	  or error in Asterisk, particularly when the situation can be gracefully
	  handled in Asterisk.

	  Currently, when this happens, a user would see the following somewhat cryptic
	  ERROR message:

	    "utils.c: write() returned error: Broken pipe"

	  There's a few problems with this:
	  (1) It doesn't provide any context, other than 'something broke a pipe'
	  (2) As noted, it isn't actually an error in Asterisk
	  (3) It can get rather spammy if the thing breaking the pipe occurs often, such

	* chan_sip: Add TCP/TLS keepalive to TCP/TLS server

	  Adds the TCP Keep Alive option to TCP and TLS server sockets. Previously
	  this option was only being set on session sockets.
	  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/
	  According to the link above, the SO_KEEPALIVE option is useful for knowing
	  when a TCP connected endpoint has severed communication without indicating
	  it or has become unreachable for some reason. Without this patch, keep
	  alive is not set on the socket listening for incoming TCP sessions and
	  in Komatsu's report this resulted in the thread listening for TCP becoming
	  stuck in a waiting state.

	  This reverts commit f42d22d3a1ca5c8ea73df99a50c6a28caa8f8749.

	  Unfortunately, using a bridge to manage T.38 state will cause severe deadlocks
	  in core_unreal/chan_local. Local channels attempt to reach across both their
	  peer and the peer's bridge to inspect T.38 state. Given the propensity of
	  Local channel chains, managing the locking situation in such a scenario is
	  practically infeasible.

	* res_pjsip/contacts/statsd:  Make contact lifecycle events more consistent

	  It will never be perfect or even pretty, mostly because of the differences
	  between static and dynamic contacts.

	  Created:

	  Can't use the contact or contact_status alloc functions
	  because the objects come and go regardless of the actual state.

	  Can't use the contact_apply_handler, ast_sip_location_add_contact or
	  a sorcery created handler because they only get called for dynamic
	  contacts.  Similarly, permanent_uri_handler only gets called for
	  static contacts.

	  So, Matt had it right. :)  ast_res_pjsip_find_or_create_contact_status is
	  the only place it can go and not have duplicated code.  Both
	  permanent_uri_handler and contact_apply_handler call find_or_create.

	  Removed:

	  Can't use the destructors for the same reason as above.  The only
	  place to put this is in persistent_endpoint_contact_deleted_observer
	  which I believe is the "correct" place but even that will handle only
	  dynamic contacts.  This doesn't called on shutdown however.  There is
	  no hook to use for static contacts that may be removed because of a
	  config change while asterisk is in operation.

	  I moved the cleanup of contact_status from ast_sip_location_delete_contact
	  to the handler as well.

	  Status Change and RTT:

	  Although they worked fine where they were (in update_contact_status) I
	  moved them to persistent_endpoint_contact_status_observer to make it
	  more consistent with removed.  There was logic there already to detect
	  a state change.

	  Finally, fixed a nit in permanent_uri_handler rmudgett reported
	  eralier.

	* bridges/bridge_t38: Add a bridging module for managing T.38 state

	  When 4875e5ac32 was merged, it fixed several issues with a direct media bridge
	  transitioning to handling a T.38 fax. However, it uncovered a race condition
	  caused by the bridging core. When a channel involved in a T.38 fax leaves a
	  bridge, the frame queued by the channel driver that should inform the far side
	  that it is no longer in a T.38 fax may not make it across the bridge. The
	  bridging framework is *extremely* aggressive in tearing down the bridge, and
	  control frames that are currently in flight *may* get dropped.

	  This patch adds a new module to the bridging framework, bridge_t38. This module
	  maintains some notion of the T.38 state for the two channels in a bridge. When
	  the bridge detects that it is being torn down or when one of the two channels
	  leaves, it informs the respective channel(s) that they should stop faxing. This
	  ensures that channels switch back to audio if they survive and are ejected out
	  of a bridge while faxing.

	* res_pjsip: Use a MD5 hash for static Contact IDs

	  When 90d9a70789 was merged, it mostly tested dynamic contacts created as
	  a result of registering a PJSIP endpoint. Contacts generated in this
	  fashion typically have a long alphanumeric string as their object identifier,
	  which maps reasonably well for StatsD. Unfortunately, this doesn't work in the
	  general case. StatsD treats both '.' and ':' characters as special characters.
	  In particular, having a ':' appear in the middle of a StatsD metric will
	  result in the metric being rejected.

	  This causes some obvious issues with SIP URIs.

	  The StatsD API should not be responsible for escaping the metric name passed
	  to it. The metric is treated as a single long string, and it would be
	  challenging to know what to escape in the string passed to the function.
	  Likewise, we don't want to escape the metric in PJSIP, as that involves
	  overhead that is wasted when either res_statsd isn't loaded or enabled.

	  This patch takes an alternative approach. The Contact ID has been changed
	  to be "aor@@uri_hash" instead of "aor@@uri". This (a) won't contain any of the
	  aforementioned special characters, (b) can be done on Contact creation,
	  which has minimal impact on run-time performance, and (c) also conforms to an
	  earlier commit that changed the ID for dynamic contacts.

	  The downside of this is that StatsD users will have to map SHA1 hashes back to
	  the Contacts that are emitting the statistics. To that end, the CLI commands
	  have been updated to include the first 10 characters of the MD5 hash, which
	  should be enough to match what is shown in Graphite (or some other StatsD
	  backend).

	* res_statsd: Add functions that support variable arguments

	  Often, the metric names of statistics we are generating for StatsD have some
	  dynamic component to them. This can be the name of a particular resource, or
	  some internal status label in Asterisk. With the current set of functions,
	  callers of the statsd API must first build the metric name themselves, then
	  pass this to the API functions. This results in a large amount of boilerplate
	  code and usage of either fixed length static buffers or dynamic memory
	  allocation, neither of which is desireable.

	  This patch adds two new functions to the StatsD API that support a printf
	  style format specifier for constructing the metric name. A dynamic string,
	  allocated in threadstorage, is used to build the metric name. This eases
	  the burden on users of the StatsD API.

	* chan_pjsip: Handle T.38 faxes with direct media bridges

	  When a channel is in a direct media bridge, a re-INVITE may arrive that forces
	  Asterisk to re-negotiate the media to a T.38 fax. When this occurs, the bridge
	  must change its technology to a simple bridge, and re-INVITE the media back
	  to Asterisk.

	  Generally, this logic mostly already exists in Asterisk. However, prior to this
	  patch, there were a few bugs:
	  (1) The T.38 framehook currently prevents a channel capable of T.38 faxes from
	      ever entering into a direct media bridge. This applies even when the only
	      media being passed over the channel is audio. This patch fixes this bug
	      by having the framehook specify that it defers caring about any frame type.
	      This allows the channels to enter into a direct media bridge, which will
	      be broken when a re-INVITE is received.
	  (2) When a re-INVITE is received, nothing instructed the bridging layer to
	      re-inspect the allowed bridging technology. This now occurs when either
	      a re-INVITE is received from a peer, or when a response is received from
	      the far end (that is, when the T.38 state changes to either
	      T38_PEER_REINVITE or T38_LOCAL_REINVITE).
	  (3) chan_pjsip needs to do a small amount of work to prevent a direct media
	      bridge from being chosen when a T.38 session is in progress. When a T.38
	      session supplement has a t38 datastore - which is added when we detect
	      we should start thinking about T.38 on a channel - we now refuse a native
	      RTP bridge.
	  (4) When a BYE request is received, we don't terminate the T.38 session. If
	      the other side of a T.38 fax survives the hangup (due to the 'g' flag
	      in Dial, for example), we don't currently re-INVITE the media on the
	      other channel back to audio. This patch now has res_pjsip_t38 intercept
	      BYE requests and inform the far side that the T.38 session is terminated.
	      This naturally causes the correct re-INVITEs to be sent.

	* res/res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Apply configuration on object type load

	  When Asterisk is configured to use a dynamic sorcery backend (such as
	  res_sorcery_astdb) with 'registration' objects, it will fail to create the
	  internal state objects associated with the registration objects on module
	  load. This is due to nothing actually querying for the specific objects
	  and calling their sorcery apply handler during module load.

	  This patch fixes that by calling get_registrations in the sorcery observer's
	  object_type_loaded handler. Doing this causes the sorcery backends to be
	  asked for the current state of all registration objects, which causes the
	  apply handler to be called and the internal run-time state to be created.

	  If the response's CSeq number differs from the CSeq number we last sent
	  with authentication then authenticate again because it is a challenge to a
	  different request.

	* res/res_pjsip: Fix off nominal crash with requests that fail and have a timer

	  When a request is sent using pjsip_endpt_send_request and fails, a condition
	  exists where the request wrapper, which is an AO2 object, may be de-ref'd
	  more times than it should. This occurs when the request's callback is called,
	  and, in the callback, the timer on the PJSIP heap is cancelled. When that
	  occurs, the request wrapper's lifetime is decremented. When
	  pjsip_endpt_send_request fails, we unilaterally decrement the lifetime of
	  the request wrapper again, even though we've already cancelled the reference
	  associated with the timer.

	  This patch checks the return result of pj_timer_heap_cancel_if_active before
	  removing the reference associated with the timer. We now only decrement it
	  in this case if a timer is cancelled as a result of the function call.

	* main/dial: Protect access to the format_cap structure of the requesting channel

	  When a dial attempt is made that involves a requesting channel, we previously

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Prevent sending NOTIFY on destroyed dialog.

	  A certain situation can result in our attempting to send a NOTIFY on a
	  destroyed dialog. Say we attempt to send a NOTIFY to a subscriber, but
	  that subscriber has dropped off the network. We end up retransmitting
	  that NOTIFY until the appropriate SIP timer says to destroy the NOTIFY
	  transaction. When the pjsip evsub code is told that the transaction has
	  been terminated, it responds in kind by alerting us that the
	  subscription has been terminated, destroying the subscription, and then
	  removing its reference to the dialog, thus destroying the dialog.

	  The problem is that when we get told that the subscription is being
	  terminated, we detect that we have not sent a terminating NOTIFY
	  request, so we queue up such a NOTIFY to be sent out. By the time that
	  queued NOTIFY gets sent, the dialog has been destroyed, so attempting to
	  send that NOTIFY can result in a crash.

	  The fix being introduced here is actually a reintroduction of something
	  the pubsub code used to employ. We hold a reference to the dialog and
	  wait to decrement our reference to the dialog until our subscription
	  tree object is destroyed. This way, we can send messages on the dialog
	  even if the PJSIP evsub code wants to terminate earlier than we would
	  like.

	  In doing this, some NULL checks for subscription tree dialogs have been
	  removed since NULL dialogs are no longer actually possible.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Ensure dialog lock balance.

	  When sending a NOTIFY, we lock the dialog and then unlock the dialog
	  when finished. A recent change made it so that the subscription tree's
	  dialog pointer will be set NULL when sending the final NOTIFY request
	  out. This means that when we attempt to unlock the dialog, we pass a
	  NULL pointer to pjsip_dlg_dec_lock(). The result is that the dialog
	  remains locked after we think we have unlocked it. When a response to
	  the NOTIFY arrives, the monitor thread attempts to lock the dialog, but
	  it cannot because we never released the dialog lock. This results in
	  Asterisk being unable to process incoming SIP traffic any longer.

	  The fix in this patch is to use a local pointer to save off the pointer
	  value of the subscription tree's dialog when locking and unlocking the
	  dialog. This way, if the subscription tree's dialog pointer is NULLed
	  out, the local pointer will still have point to the proper place and the
	  dialog lock will be unlocked as we expect.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Remove serializer when sending final NOTIFY.

	  There have been crashes seen where a taskprocessor's listener is NULL
	  unexpectedly.

	  Looking at backtraces, the problem was specifically seen in PJSIP
	  serializers.

	  Subscriptions make the mistake of removing a serializer from a dialog
	  during subscription tree destruction. Since subscription trees are
	  reference-counted, guaranteeing the circumstances behind the destruction
	  are not possible. This makes it so that the dialog serializer can be
	  removed while not holding the dialog lock. This makes it possible for
	  the distributor to get a pointer to the dialog serializer and have that
	  serializer get freed out from under it.

	  The fix for this is to remove the serializer from a subscription dialog
	  when sending the final NOTIFY. This guarantees that the serializer is
	  removed with the dialog lock held. By doing this, we guarantee that if
	  the distributor gains access to the dialog's serializer, it will not be
	  possible for the serializer to get freed by another thread.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Solidify lifetime and ownership of objects.

	  There have been crashes and general instability seen in the pubsub code,
	  so this patch introduces three changes to increase the stability.

	  First, the ownership model for subscriptions has been modified. Due to
	  RLS, subscriptions are stored in memory as a tree structure. Prior to my
	  patch, the PJSIP subscription was the owner of the subscription tree.
	  When the PJSIP subscription told us that it was terminating, we started
	  destroying the subscription tree along with all of the individual leaf
	  subscriptions that belong to the tree. The problem with this model is
	  that the two actors in play here, the PJSIP subscription and the
	  individual leaf subscriptions, need to have joint ownership of the
	  subscription tree. So now, the PJSIP subscription and the individual
	  leaf subscriptions each have a reference to the subscription tree. This
	  way, we will not actually free memory until no players are left that
	  care. The PJSIP subscription is a bigger stakeholder, in that if the
	  PJSIP subscription's reference to the subscription tree is removed, the
	  subscription tree instructs the leaf subscriptions to shut down and drop
	  their references to the subscription tree when possible. The individual
	  leaf subscriptions, upon being told to shut down, can drop their stasis
	  subscriptions or whatever they use to learn of new state, and then drop
	  their reference to the subscription tree once they are ready to die.

	  Second, the lifetime of a PJSIP subscription's reference to our
	  subscription tree has been altered. As I learned from doing a deep dive,
	  the PJSIP evsub code can tell Asterisk multiple times that the
	  subscription has been terminated, and not all of these times
	  are especially helpful. I have altered the message flow that we use for
	  SIP subscriptions such that we will always drop the PJSIP subscription's
	  reference to the subscription tree when we send the NOTIFY that
	  terminates a SIP subscription. This also means that we will now queue
	  NOTIFY requests to be sent after responding to incoming SUBSCRIBEs so
	  that we can have predictable state changes from the PJSIP evsub code.

	  Third, the synchronization of operations has been improved. PJSIP can
	  call into our code from a serializer thread (e.g. upon receiving an
	  incoming request) or from the monitor thread (e.g. when a subscription
	  times out). Because of this, there is the possibility of competing
	  threads stepping on each other. PJSIP attempts to do some
	  synchronization on its own by always keeping the dialog lock held when
	  it calls into us. However, since we end up pushing tasks into the
	  serializer, the result was that serialized operations were not grabbing
	  the dialog lock and could, as a result, step on something that was being
	  attempted by a different thread. Now we ensure that serialized
	  operations grab the dialog lock, then check for extenuating
	  circumstances, then proceed with their operation if they can.

	* res_pjsip: Move URI validation to use time.

	  In a realtime based system with a limited number of threadpool threads
	  it is possible for a deadlock to occur. This happens when permanent
	  endpoint state is updated, which will cause database queries to be done.
	  These queries may result in URI validation being done which is done
	  synchronously using a PJSIP thread. If all PJSIP threads are in use
	  processing traffic they themselves may be blocked waiting to get the
	  permanent endpoint container lock when identifying an endpoint.

	  This change moves URI validation to occur at use time instead of
	  configuration time. While this comes at a cost of not seeing a problem
	  until you use it it does solve the underlying deadlock problem.

	  Thanks to mdu113 for discovering that there was a call to pgsql_exec() not
	  protected by the pgsql_lock reentrancy lock.

	  {quote}
	  I believe a code path exists that attempts to use pgsql connection without
	  locking pgsql_lock.  I believe what happens during that deadlock that I
	  see is two concurrent threads are both attempting to send query to pgsql,
	  one of the thread is using a code path without locking pgsql_lock.  If
	  they managed to send queries at the same time, it seems postgres ignores
	  one of the queries and replies only to the one of them.  If it happens so
	  that the thread holding the lock didn't receive the reply it will wait for
	  it (and hold the lock) forever (or at least for very long time), thus
	  completely blocking all access to db.
	  {quote}

	  * Added missing reentrancy locking around pgsql_exec() in find_table().

	  * Moved unlock of pgsql_lock in unload_module() to avoid locking inversion

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk: Fix assignment after ao2 decrement

	  When we decide we will no longer schedule an RTCP write, we remove the
	  reference to the RTP instance, then assign -1 to the stored scheduler ID
	  in case something else comes along and wants to see if anything is scheduled.

	  That scheduler ID is on the RTP instance. After 60a9172d7ef2 was merged to
	  fix the regression introduced by 3cf0f29310, this improper assignment on a
	  potentially destroyed object started getting tripped on the build agents.

	  Frankly, this should have been crashing a lot more often earlier. I can only
	  assume that the timing was changed just enough by both changes to start
	  actually hitting this problem.

	  As it is, simply moving the assignment prior to the ao2 deference is sufficient
	  to keep the RTP instance from being referenced when it is very, truly,
	  aboslutely dead.

	  (Note that it is still good practice to assign -1 to the scheduler ID when we
	  know we won't be scheduling it again, as the ao2 deref *may* not always destroy
	  the ao2 object.)

	  Apparently some endpoints attempt to send a reINVITE before completing the
	  initial INVITE transaction.  In this case PJSIP responds appropriately to
	  the reINVITE with a 491 INVITE request pending.  Unfortunately chan_pjsip
	  is using the initial INVITE transaction state to determine if an INVITE is
	  the initial INVITE or a reINVITE.  Since the initial INVITE transaction
	  has not been confirmed yet chan_pjsip thinks the reINVITE is an initial
	  INVITE and starts another PBX thread on the channel.  The extra PBX thread
	  ensures that hilarity ensues.

	* main/logger: Add log formatters and JSON structured logs

	  When Asterisk is part of a larger distributed system, log files are often
	  gathered using tools (such as logstash) that prefer to consume information
	  and have it rendered using other tools (such as Kibana) that prefer a
	  structured format, e.g., JSON. This patch adds support for JSON formatted
	  logs by adding support for an optional log format specifier in Asterisk's
	  logging subsystem. By adding a format specifier of '[json]':

	  full => [json]debug,verbose,notice,warning,error

	  Log messages will be output to the 'full' channel in the following
	  format:

	  {
	    "hostname": Hostname or name specified in asterisk.conf
	    "timestamp": Date/Time

	* res/res_stasis: Fix accidental subscription to 'all' bridge topic

	  When b99a7052621700a1aa641a1c24308f5873275fc8 was merged, subscribing to a
	  NULL bridge will now cause app_subscribe_bridge to implicitly subscribe to
	  all bridges. Unfortunately, the res_stasis control loop did not check that
	  a bridge changing on a channel's control object was actually also non-NULL.
	  As a result, app_subscribe_bridge will be called with a NULL bridge when a
	  channel leaves a bridge. This causes a new subscription to be made to the
	  bridge. If an application has also subscribed to the bridge, the application
	  will now have two subscriptions:
	  (1) The explicit one created by the app
	  (2) The implicit one accidentally created by the control structure

	  As a result, the 'BridgeDestroyed' event can be sent multiple times. This
	  patch corrects the control loop such that it only subscribes an application
	  to a new bridge if the bridge pointer is non-NULL.

	* logger: Prevent duplicate dynamic channels from being added.

	  There was a problem observed where the "logger add channel" CLI command
	  would allow for a channel with the same name to be added multiple times.
	  This would result in each message being written out to the same file
	  multiple times.

	  The problem was due to the difference in how logger channel filenames
	  are stored versus the format they are allowed to be presented when they
	  are added. For instance, if adding the logger channel "foo" through the
	  CLI, the result would be a logger channel with the file name
	  /var/log/asterisk/foo being stored. So when trying to add another "foo"
	  channel, "foo" would not match "/var/log/asterisk/foo" so we'd happily
	  add the duplicate channel.

	  The fix presented here is to introduce two new methods in the logger
	  code:
	   * make_filename(): given a logger channel name, this creates the
	     filename for that logger channel.
	   * find_logchannel(): given a logger channel name, this calls
	     make_filename() and then traverses the list of logchannels in order
	     to find a match.

	  This change has made use of make_filename() and find_logchannel()
	  throughout to more consistently behave.

	* Do not swallow frames on channels leaving bridges.

	  When leaving a bridge, indications on a channel could be swallowed by
	  the internal indication logic because it appears that the channel is on
	  its way to be hung up anyway. One such situation where this is
	  detrimental is when channels on hold are redirected out of a bridge. The
	  AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD indication from the bridging code is swallowed,
	  leaving the channel in question to still appear to be on hold.

	  The fix here is to modify the logic inside ast_indicate_data() to not
	  drop the indication if the channel is simply leaving a bridge. This way,
	  channels on hold redirected out of a bridge revert to their expected "in
	  use" state after the redirection.

	* app_page.c: Fix crash when forwarding with a predial handler.

	  Page uses the async method of dialing with the dial API.  When a call gets
	  forwarded there is no calling channel available.  If the predial handler
	  was set then the calling channel could not be put into auto-service
	  for the forwarded call because it doesn't exist.  A crash is the result.

	  * Moved the callee predial parameter string processing to before the
	  string is passed to the dial API rather than having the dial API do it.
	  There are a few benefits do doing this.  The first is the predial
	  parameter string processing doesn't need to be done for each channel
	  called by the dial API.  The second is in async mode and the forwarded
	  channel is to have the predial handler executed on it then the
	  non-existent calling channel does not need to be present to process the
	  predial parameter string.

	  * Don't start auto-service on a non-existent calling channel to execute
	  the predial handler when the dial API is in async mode and forwarding a
	  call.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Eliminate race during initial NOTIFY.

	  There is a slim chance of a race condition occurring where two threads
	  can both attempt to manipulate the same area.

	  Thread A can be handling an incoming initial SUBSCRIBE request. Thread A
	  lets the specific subscription handler know that the subscription has
	  been established.

	  At this point, Thread B may detect a state change on the subscribed
	  resource and queue up a notification task on Thread C, the subscription
	  serializer thread.

	  Now Thread A attempts to generate the initial NOTIFY request to send to
	  the subscriber at the same time that Thread C attempts to generate a
	  state change NOTIFY request to send to the subscriber.

	  The result is that Threads A and C can step on the same memory area,
	  resulting in a crash. The crash has been observed as happening when
	  attempting to allocate more space to hold the body for the NOTIFY.

	  The solution presented here is to queue the subscription establishment
	  and initial NOTIFY generation onto the subscription serializer thread
	  (Thread C in the above scenario). This way, there is no way that a state
	  change notification can occur before the initial NOTIFY is sent, and if
	  there is a quick succession of NOTIFYs, we can guarantee that the two
	  NOTIFY requests will be sent in succession.

	* scheduler: Use queue for allocating sched IDs.

	  It has been observed that on long-running busy systems, a scheduler
	  context can eventually hit INT_MAX for its assigned IDs and end up
	  overflowing into a very low negative number. When this occurs, this can
	  result in odd behaviors, because a negative return is interpreted by
	  callers as being a failure. However, the item actually was successfully
	  scheduled. The result may be that a freed item remains in the scheduler,
	  resulting in a crash at some point in the future.

	  The scheduler can overflow because every time that an item is added to
	  the scheduler, a counter is bumped and that counter's current value is
	  assigned as the new item's ID.

	  This patch introduces a new method for assigning scheduler IDs. Instead
	  of assigning from a counter, a queue of available IDs is maintained.
	  When assigning a new ID, an ID is pulled from the queue. When a
	  scheduler item is released, its ID is pushed back onto the queue. This
	  way, IDs may be reused when they become available, and the growth of ID
	  numbers is directly related to concurrent activity within a scheduler
	  context rather than the uptime of the system.

	* main/config_options: Check for existance of internal object before derefing

	  Asterisk can load and register an object type while still having an invalid
	  sorcery mapping. This can cause an issue when a creation call is invoked.
	  For example, mis-configuring PJSIP's endpoint identifier by IP address mapping
	  in sorcery.conf will cause the sorcery mechanism to be invalidated; however, a
	  subsequent ARI invocation to create the object will cause a crash, as the
	  internal type may not be registered as sorcery expects.

	  Merely checking for a NULL pointer here solves the issue.

	* res/res_pjsip: Purge contacts when an AoR is deleted

	  When an AoR is deleted by an external mechanism, such as through ARI, we
	  currently do not remove dynamic contacts that were created for that AoR as a
	  result of a received REGISTER request. As a result, re-creating the AoR will
	  cause the dynamic contact to be interpreted as a persistent contact, leading

	  This patch adds a sorcery observer for the 'aor' object. When a delete is
	  issued on the underlying sorcery object, the observer is called, and all
	  contacts created and persisted in sorcery for that AoR are also removed. Note
	  that we don't want to perform this action when an AO2 object that is an AoR is
	  destroyed, as the AoR can still exist in the backing storage (and we would
	  thus be removing valid contacts from an AoR that still "exists".)

	* res_pjsip: Change default from user value.

	  When Asterisk sends an outbound SIP request, if there is no direct

	  Asterisk would generate a UUID. For example, this would happen when
	  sending outbound OPTIONS requests when qualifying or when sending
	  outbound INVITE requests when originating (if no explicit caller ID were

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: re-re-fix persistent subscription storage.

	  A recent change to res_pjsip_pubsub switched to using pjsip_msg_print as
	  a means of writing an appropriate packet to persistent storage. While
	  this partially solved the issue, it had its own problems.
	  pjsip_msg_print will always add a Content-Length header to the message
	  it prints. Frequent restarts of Asterisk can result in persistent
	  subscriptions being written with five or more Content-Length headers. In
	  addition, sometimes some apparent corruption of individual headers could
	  be seen.

	  This aims to fix the problem by not running a parsed message through an
	  interpreter but rather by taking the raw message and saving it. The
	  logic for what to save is going to be different depending on whether a
	  SUBSCRIBE was received from the wire or if it was pulled from
	  persistence. When receiving a packet from the wire, when using a
	  streaming transport, the rdata->pkt_info.packet may contain multiple SIP
	  messages or fragments. However, the rdata->msg_info.msg_buf will always
	  contain the current SIP message to be processed. When pulling from
	  persistence, though, the rdata->msg_info.msg_buf will be NULL since no
	  transport actually handled the packet. However, since we know that we
	  will always ever pull one SIP message from persistence, we are free to
	  save directly from rdata->pkt_info.packet instead.

	* res_pjsip: Add common ast_sip_get_host_ip API.

	  Modules commonly used the pj_gethostip function for retrieving the
	  IP address of the host. This function does not cache the result and may
	  result in a DNS lookup occurring, or additional work. If the DNS
	  server is unreachable or network issues arise this can cause the
	  pj_gethostip function to block for a period of time.

	  This change adds an ast_sip_get_host_ip and ast_sip_get_host_ip_string
	  function which does the same thing but caches the host IP address at
	  module load time. This results in no additional work being done each
	  time the local host IP address is needed.

	* bridge: Kick channel from bridge if hung up during action.

	  When executing an action in a bridge it is possible for the
	  channel to be hung up without the bridge becoming aware of it.
	  This is most easily reproducible by hanging up when the bridge
	  is streaming DTMF due to a feature timeout. This change makes
	  it so after action execution the channel is checked to determine
	  if it has been hung up and if it has it is kicked from the bridge.

	  When an endpoint is backed by a non-static conf file backend (such as
	  the AstDB or Realtime), the 'auth' object may be returned as being an
	  empty string. Currently, res_pjsip will interpret that as being a valid
	  auth object, and will attempt to authenticate inbound requests. This
	  isn't desired; is an auth value is empty (which the name of an auth
	  object cannot be), we should instead interpret that as being an invalid
	  auth object and skip it.

	* rtp_engine.c: Initial split of payload types into rx and tx mappings.

	  There are numerous problems with the current implementation of the RTP
	  payload type mapping in Asterisk.  It uses only one mapping structure to
	  associate payload types to codecs.  The single mapping is overkill if all
	  of the payload type values are well known values.  Dynamic payload type
	  mappings do not work as well with the single mapping because RFC3264
	  allows each side of the link to negotiate different dynamic mappings for
	  what they want to receive.  Not only could you have the same codec mapped
	  for sending and receiving on different payload types you could wind up
	  with the same payload type mapped to different codecs for each direction.

	  1) An independent payload type mapping is needed for sending and
	  receiving.

	  2) The receive mapping needs to keep track of previous mappings because of
	  the slack to when negotiation happens and current packets in flight using
	  the old mapping arrive.

	  3) The transmit mapping only needs to keep track of the current negotiated
	  values since we are sending the packets and know when the switchover takes
	  place.

	  * Needed to create ast_rtp_codecs_payload_code_tx() and make some callers
	  use the new function because ast_rtp_codecs_payload_code() was used for
	  mappings in both directions.

	  * Needed to create ast_rtp_codecs_payloads_xover() for cases where we need
	  to pass preferred codec mappings to the peer channel for early media
	  bridging or when we need to prefer the offered mapping that RFC3264 says
	  we SHOULD use.

	  * ast_rtp_codecs_payloads_xover() and ast_rtp_codecs_payload_code_tx() are
	  the only new public functions created.  All the others were only used for
	  the tx or rx mapping direction so the function doxygen now reflects which
	  direction the function operates.

	  * chan_mgcp.c: Removed call to ast_rtp_codecs_payloads_clear() as doing
	  that makes no sense when processing an incoming SDP.  We would be wiping
	  out any mappings that we set for the possible outgoing SDP we sent
	  earlier.

	* chan_dahdi.c: Flush the DAHDI write buffer after starting DTMF.

	  Pressing DTMF digits on a phone to go out on a DAHDI channel can result in
	  the digit not being recognized or even heard by the peer.

	  Phone -> Asterisk -> DAHDI/channel

	  Turns out the DAHDI behavior with DTMF generation (and any other generated
	  tones) is exposed by the "buffers=" setting in chan_dahdi.conf.  When
	  Asterisk requests to start sending DTMF then DAHDI waits until its write
	  buffer is empty before generating any samples for the DTMF tones.  When
	  Asterisk subsequently requests DAHDI to stop sending DTMF then DAHDI
	  immediately stops generating the DTMF samples.  As a result, the more
	  samples there are in the DAHDI write buffer the shorter the time DTMF
	  actually gets sent on the wire.  If there are more samples in the write
	  buffer than the time DTMF is supposed to be sent then no DTMF gets sent on
	  the wire.  With the "buffers=12,half" setting and each buffer representing
	  20 ms of samples then the DAHDI write buffer is going to contain around
	  120 ms of samples.  For DTMF to be recognized by the peer the actual sent
	  DTMF duration needs to be a minimum of 40 ms.  Therefore, the intended
	  duration needs to be a minimum of 160 ms for the peer to receive the
	  minimum DTMF digit duration to recognize it.

	  A simple and effective solution to work around the DAHDI behavior is for
	  Asterisk to flush the DAHDI write buffer when sending DTMF so the full
	  duration of DTMF is actually sent on the wire.  When someone is going to
	  send DTMF they are not likely to be talking before sending the tones so
	  the flushed write samples are expected to just contain silence.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: More accurately persist packet.

	  The pjsip_rx_data structure has a pkt_info.packet field on it that is
	  the packet that was read from the transport. For datagram transports,
	  the packet read from the transport will correspond to the SIP message
	  that arrived. For streamed transports, however, it is possible to read
	  multiple SIP messages in one packet.

	  In a recent case, Asterisk crashed on a system where TCP was being used.
	  This is because at some point, a read from the TCP socket resulted in a
	  200 OK response as well as an incoming SUBSCRIBE request being stored in
	  rdata->pkt_info.packet. When the SUBSCRIBE was processed, the
	  combination 200 OK and SUBSCRIBE was saved in persistent storage. Later,
	  a restart of Asterisk resulted in the crash because the persistent
	  subscription recreation code ended up building the 200 OK response
	  instead of a SUBSCRIBE request, and we attempted to access
	  request-specific data.

	  The fix here is to use the pjsip_msg_print() function in order to
	  persist SUBSCRIBE requests. This way, rather than using the raw socket
	  data, we use the parsed SIP message that PJSIP has given us. If we
	  receive multiple SIP messages from a single read, we will be sure only
	  to save off the relevant SIP message. There also is a safeguard put in
	  place to make sure that if we do end up reconstructing a SIP response,
	  it will not cause a crash.

	* res_pjsip: Ensure sanitized XML is NULL terminated.

	  The ast_sip_sanitize_xml function is used to sanitize
	  a string for placement into XML. This is done by examining
	  an input string and then appending values to an output
	  buffer. The function used by its implementation, strncat,
	  has specific behavior that was not taken into account.
	  If the size of the input string exceeded the available
	  output buffer size it was possible for the sanitization
	  function to write past the output buffer itself causing
	  a crash. The crash would either occur because it was
	  writing into memory it shouldn't be or because the resulting
	  string was not NULL terminated.

	  This change keeps count of how much remaining space is
	  available in the output buffer for text and only allows
	  strncat to use that amount.

	  Since this was exposed by the res_pjsip_pidf_digium_body_supplement
	  module attempting to send a large message the maximum allowed
	  message size has also been increased in it.

	  A unit test has also been added which confirms that the
	  ast_sip_sanitize_xml function is providing NULL terminated
	  output even when the input length exceeds the output
	  buffer size.

	* res_http_websocket: Debug write lengths.

	  Commit 39cc28f6ea2140ad6d561fd4c9e9a66f065cecee attempted to fix a
	  test failure observed on 32 bit test agents by ensuring that a cast from
	  a 32 bit unsigned integer to a 64 bit unsigned integer was happening in
	  a predictable place. As it turns out, this did not cause test runs to
	  succeed.

	  This commit adds several redundant debug messages that print the payload
	  lengths of websocket frames. The idea here is that this commit will not
	  cause tests to succeed for the faulty test agent, but we might deduce
	  where the fault lies more easily this way by observing at what point the
	  expected value (537) changes to some ungangly huge number.

	  If you are wondering why something like this is being committed to the
	  branch, keep in mind that in commit
	  39cc28f6ea2140ad6d561fd4c9e9a66f065cecee I noted that the observed test
	  failures only happen when automated tests are run. Attempts to run the
	  tests by hand manually on the test agent result in the tests passing.

	* res_http_websocket: Avoid passing strlen() to ast_websocket_write().

	  We have seen a rash of test failures on a 32-bit build agent. Commit
	  48698a5e21d7307f61b5fb2bd39fd593bc1423ca solved an obvious problem where
	  we were not encoding a 64-bit value correctly over the wire. This
	  commit, however, did not solve the test failures.

	  In the failing tests, ARI is attempting to send a 537 byte text frame
	  over a websocket. When sending a frame this small, 16 bits are all that
	  is required in order to encode the payload length on the websocket
	  frame. However, ast_websocket_write() thinks that the payload length is
	  greater than 65535 and therefore writes out a 64 bit payload length.
	  Inspecting this payload length, the lower 32 bits are exactly what we
	  would expect it to be, 537 in hex. The upper 32 bits, are junk values
	  that are not expected to be there.

	  In the failure, we are passing the result of strlen() to a function that
	  expects a uint64_t parameter to be passed in. strlen() returns a size_t,
	  which on this 32-bit machine is 32 bits wide. Normally, passing a 32-bit
	  unsigned value to somewhere where a 64-bit unsigned value is expected
	  would cause no problems. In fact, in manual runs of failing tests, this
	  works just fine. However, ast_websocket_write() uses the Asterisk
	  optional API, which means that rather than a simple function call, there
	  are a series of macros that are used for its declaration and
	  implementation. These macros may be causing some sort of error to occur
	  when converting from a 32 bit quantity to a 64 bit quantity.

	  This commit changes the logic by making existing ast_websocket_write()
	  calls use ast_websocket_write_string() instead. Within
	  ast_websocket_write_string(), the 64-bit converted strlen is saved in a
	  local variable, and that variable is passed to ast_websocket_write()
	  instead.

	  Note that this commit message is full of speculation rather than
	  certainty. This is because the observed test failures, while always
	  present in automated test runs, never occur when tests are manually
	  attempted on the same test agent. The idea behind this commit is to fix
	  a theoretical issue by performing changes that should, at the least,
	  cause no harm. If it turns out that this change does not fix the failing
	  tests, then this commit should be reverted.

	* ARI: Channels added to Stasis application during WebSocket creation ...

	  Prior to ASTERISK-24988, the WebSocket handshake was resolved before Stasis
	  applications were registered. This was done such that the WebSocket would be
	  ready when an application is registered. However, by creating the WebSocket
	  first, the client had the ability to make requests for the Stasis application
	  it thought had been created with the initial handshake request. The inevitable
	  conclusion of this scenario was the cart being put before the horse.

	  ASTERISK-24988 resolved half of the problem by ensuring that the applications
	  were created and registered with Stasis prior to completing the handshake
	  with the client. While this meant that Stasis was ready when the client
	  received the green-light from Asterisk, it also meant that the WebSocket was
	  not yet ready for Stasis to dispatch messages.

	  This patch introduces a message queuing mechanism for delaying messages from
	  Stasis applications while the WebSocket is being constructed. When the ARI
	  event processor receives the message from the WebSocket that it is being
	  created, the event processor instantiates an event session which contains a
	  message queue. It then tries to create and register the requested applications
	  with Stasis. Messages that are dispatched from Stasis between this point and
	  the point at which the event processor is notified the WebSocket is ready, are
	  stashed in the queue. Once the WebSocket has been built, the queue's messages
	  are dispatched in the order in which they were originally received and the
	  queue is concurrently cleared.

	* dns_core: Allow zero-length DNS responses.

	* res_http_websocket: Properly encode 64 bit payload

	  A test agent was continuously failing all ARI tests when run against
	  Asterisk 13. As it turns out, the reason for this is that on those test
	  runs, for some reason we decided to use the super extended 64 bit
	  payload length for websocket text frames instead of the extended 16 bit
	  payload length. For 64-bit payloads, the expected byte order over the
	  network is

	  7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

	  However, we were sending the payload as

	  3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5, 4

	  This meant that we were saying to expect an absolutely MASSIVE payload
	  to arrive. Since we did not follow through on this expected payload
	  size, the client would sit patiently waiting for the rest of the payload
	  to arrive until the test would time out.

	  With this change, we use the htobe64() function instead of htonl() so
	  that a 64-bit byte-swap is performed instead of a 32 bit byte-swap.

	* Local channels: Alternate solution to ringback problem.

	  Commit 54b25c80c8387aea9eb20f9f4f077486cbdf3e5d solved an issue where a
	  specific scenario involving local channels and a native local RTP bridge
	  could result in ringback still being heard on a calling channel even
	  after the call is bridged.

	  That commit caused many tests in the testsuite to fail with alarming
	  consequences, such as not sending DialBegin and DialEnd events, and
	  giving incorrect hangup causes during calls.

	  This commit reverts the previous commit and implements and alternate
	  solution. This new solution involves only passing AST_CONTROL_RINGING
	  frames across local channels if the local channel is in AST_STATE_RING.
	  Otherwise, the frame does not traverse the local channels. By doing
	  this, we can ensure that a playtones generator does not get started on
	  the calling channel but rather is started on the local channel on which
	  the ringing frame was initially indicated.

	* Local channels: Do not block control -1 payloads.

	  Control frames with a -1 payload are used as a special signal to stop
	  playtones generators on channels. This indication is sent both by
	  app_dial as well as by ast_answer() when a call is answered in case any
	  tones were being generated on a calling channel.

	  This control frame type was made to stop traversing local channel pairs
	  as an optimization, because it was thought that it was unnecessary to
	  send these indications, and allowing such unnecessary control frames to
	  traverse the local channels would cause the local channels to optimize
	  away less quickly.

	  As it turns out, through some special magic dialplan code, it is
	  possible to have a tones being played on a non-local channel, and it is
	  important for the local channel to convey that the tones should be
	  stopped. The result of having tones continue to be played on the
	  non-local channel is that the tones play even once the channel has been
	  bridged. By not blocking the -1 control frame type, we can ensure that
	  this situation does not happen.

	* audiohook: Read the correct number of samples based on audiohook format.

	  Due to changes in audiohooks to support different sample rates the
	  underlying storage of samples is in the format of the audiohook
	  itself and not of the format being requested. This means that if a
	  channel is using G722 the samples stored will be at 16kHz. If
	  something subsequently reads from the audiohook at a format which
	  is not the same sample rate as the audiohook the number of samples
	  needs to be adjusted.

	  Given the following example:
	  1. Channel writing into audiohook at 16kHz (as it is using G722).
	  2. Chanspy reading from audiohook at 8kHz.

	  The original code would read 160 samples from the audiohook for
	  each 20ms of audio. This is incorrect. Since the audio in the
	  audiohook is at 16kHz the actual number needing to be read is 320.
	  Failure to read this much would cause the audiohook to reset
	  itself constantly as the buffer became full.

	  This change adjusts the requested number of samples by determining
	  the duration of audio requested and then calculating how many
	  samples that would be in the audiohook format.

	* cdr/cdr_adaptive_odbc.c: Fix quoted identifier usage when inserting CDR records

	  Commit a24ce38 added support for the use of quoted indentifiers when inserting
	  CDR records into the database. However, the if statement logic responsible for
	  determining whether to use those identifiers is reversed, resulting in a
	  reference to the quoted identifier character buffer which will be null, hence
	  null terminating the SQL query, resulting in a truncated statement which
	  fails to execute.

	* ARI: Add support for push configuration of dynamic object

	  This patch adds support for push configuration of dynamic, i.e.,
	  sorcery, objects in Asterisk. It adds three new REST API calls to the
	  'asterisk' resource:
	   * GET /asterisk/{configClass}/{objectType}/{id}: retrieve the current
	     object given its ID. This returns back a list of ConfigTuples, which
	     define the fields and their present values that make up the object.
	   * PUT /asterisk/{configClass}/{objectType}/{id}: create or update an
	     object. A body may be passed with the request that contains fields to
	     populate in the object. The same format as what is retrieved using
	     the GET operation is used for the body, save that we specify that the
	     list of fields to update are contained in the "fields" attribute.
	   * DELETE /asterisk/{configClass}/{objectType}/{id}: remove a dynamic
	     object from its backing storage.

	  Note that the success/failure of these operations is somewhat
	  configuration dependent, i.e., you must be using a sorcery wizard that
	  supports the operation in question. If a sorcery wizard does not support
	  the create or delete mechanisms, then the REST API call will fail with a
	  403 forbidden.

	  VarSet event to not get posted if the new value was an empty string.

	  * Fixed dest buffer overwrite potential in ast_escape() and
	  ast_escape_c().  If the dest buffer size is smaller than the space needed
	  by the escaped s parameter string then the dest buffer would be written
	  beyond the end by the nul string terminator.  The num parameter was really
	  the dest buffer size parameter so I renamed it to size.

	* res_pjsip_session.c: Fix crash on call disconnect.

	  The crash fix for ASTERISK-25183 backported some code from master to try
	  to make sure that a BYE response is processed by the same serializer used
	  by the BYE request.  The identified race condition causing that backport
	  was the BYE request code had not finished processing after sending the BYE
	  before the BYE response came in for processing under a different thread.
	  Unfortunately, there is still a race condition.  Now the race condition is
	  between destroying the call session's serializer in
	  ast_taskprocessor_unreference() and using ast_taskprocessor_get() to get a
	  reference to the serializer for a BYE response.  Even worse, the new race
	  condition is a design limitation of the taskprocessor implementation that
	  didn't matter in versions before v12.  Back then, taskprocessors were only
	  destroyed when a module unloaded.  Now res_pjsip can destroy them when a
	  call ends.

	  However, as noted on the ASTERISK-25183 commit,
	  session_inv_on_state_changed() is disassociating the dialog from the
	  session when the invite dialog state becomes PJSIP_INV_STATE_DISCONNECTED.
	  This is a tad too soon because our BYE request transaction has not
	  completed yet.

	  * Split session_end() that is called by session_inv_on_state_changed() to
	  hold off session destruction until the BYE transaction timeout occurs or a
	  failed initial INVITE transaction timeout occurs in
	  session_inv_on_tsx_state_changed().

	* media cache: Add a core API and facade for a backend agnostic media cache

	  This patch adds a new API to the Asterisk core that acts as a media
	  cache. The core API itself is mostly a thin wrapper around some bucket
	  API provided implementation that itself acts as the mechanism of
	  retrieval for media. The media cache API in the core provides the
	  following:
	   * A very thin in-memory cache of the active bucket_file items. Unlike a
	     more traditional cache, it provides no expiration mechanisms. Most
	     queries that hit the in-memory cache will also call into the bucket
	     implementations as well. The bucket implementations are responsible
	     for determining whether or not the active record is active and valid.
	     This makes sense for the most likely implementation of a media cache
	     backend, i.e., HTTP. The HTTP layer itself is the actual arbiter of
	     whether or not a record is truly active; as such, the in-memory cache
	     in the core has to defer to it.
	   * The ability to create new items in the media cache from local
	     resources. This allows for re-creation of items in the cache on
	     restart.
	   * Synchronization of items in the media cache to the AstDB. This
	     also includes various pieces of important metadata.

	  The API provides sufficient access that higher level APIs, such as the
	  file or app APIs, do not have to worry about the semantics of the bucket
	  APIs when needing to playback a resource.

	  In addition, this patch provides unit tests for the media cache API. The
	  unit tests use a fake bucket backend to verify correctness.

	  ao2_callback_fn callback on each piece of metadata associated with the

	  This is particularly useful when a bucket backend has added metadata,
	  and a higher level API wants to be aware of/access said metadata,

	* main/format_cap: Parse capabilities generated by ast_format_cap_get_names

	  We have a strange relationship between the parsing of format
	  capabilities from a string and their representation as a string. We
	  expect the format capabilities to be expressed as a string in the
	  following format:

	  allow = !all,ulaw,alaw
	  disallow = g722

	  While we would generate the string representation of those formats as:

	  allow = (ulaw|alaw)
	  disallow = (ulaw|alaw|g729...)

	  When the configuration framework needs to store values as a string, it
	  generates the format capabilities using the second representation; this
	  representation however cannot be parsed when the entry is rehydrated.
	  This patch fixes that by updating
	  ast_format_cap_update_by_allow_disallow to parse an entry as if it were
	  in the generated format if it has a leading '(' and a trailing ')'.

	    is documented to be 'no', this will now apply that as the default
	    value.

	* bridge_native_rtp.c: Don't start native RTP bridging after attended transfer.

	  The bridge_native_rtp module adds a frame hook to channels which are in
	  a native RTP bridge. This frame hook is used to intercept when a hold
	  or unhold frame traverses the bridge so native RTP can be stopped or
	  started as appropriate. This is expected but exposes a specific bug
	  when attended transfers are involved.

	  Upon completion of an attended transfer an unhold frame is queued up
	  to take one of the channels involved off hold. After this is done
	  the channel is moved between bridges.

	  When the frame hook is involved in this case for the unhold it
	  releases the channel lock and acquires the bridge lock. This
	  allows the bridge core to step in and move the channel
	  (potentially changing the bridging techology) from another thread.
	  Once completed the bridge lock is released by the bridge core.
	  The frame hook is then able to acquire the bridge lock and
	  wrongfully starts native RTP again, despite the channel no longer
	  being in the bridge or needing to start native RTP. In fact at
	  this point the frame hook is no longer attached to the channel.

	  This change makes it so the native RTP bridge data is available to
	  the frame hook when it is invoked. Whether the frame hook has
	  been detached or not is stored on the native RTP bridge data and
	  is checked by the frame hook before starting or stopping native
	  RTP bridging. If the frame hook has been detached it does nothing.

	* DNS: Create a system-level DNS resolver

	  Prior to this patch, the DNS core present in master had no default system-level

	  perform resolutions unless the libunbound library was installed and the
	  res_resolver_unbound module was loaded.

	  This patch introduces a system-level DNS resolver implementation that will
	  register itself with the lowest consideration priority available (to ensure
	  that it is to be used only as a last resort). The resolver relies on low-level
	  DNS search functions to perform a rudimentary DNS search based on a provided
	  query and then supplies the search results to the DNS core.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Prevent simultaneous access to DTLS SSL context.

	  This change moves logic for setting up the DTLS SSL contexts to
	  when the SDP is done being processed instead of when ICE negotiation
	  completes. It also stops handshakes from being initiated when we
	  are acting as a server.

	  Manipulating the SSL context when ICE negotiation has completed
	  is problematic as the SSL context is not protected and if acting
	  as a client the remote side may have started DTLS negotiation
	  already.

	  The retransmission timeout timer code has also been split up
	  and simplified some. Both RTP and RTCP now have their own timers
	  and the points at which the timer is stopped and started is now
	  more specific. When a packet is sent the timer is started. When
	  a response is received but before it is processed the timer is
	  stopped. This provides a guarantee that the timeout is not
	  occurring while the response is processed.

	* bucket: Add clone/staleness operations for ast_bucket/ast_bucket_file

	  This patch enhances the bucket API in two ways.

	  First, since ast_bucket and ast_bucket_file instances are immutable, a 'clone'
	  operation has been added that provides a 'clone' of an existing
	  ast_bucket/ast_bucket_file object. Note that this makes use of the
	  ast_sorcery_copy operation, along with the copy callback handler on the
	  "bucket" and "file" object types for the bucket sorcery instance.

	  Second, there is a need for the bucket API to ask a wizard if an object
	  is stale. This is particularly useful with the upcoming media cache
	  enhancements, where we want to ask the backing data storage if the
	  object we are currently operating on has known updates. This patch adds
	  API calls for ast_bucket and ast_bucket_file objects, which callback
	  into their respective sorcery wizards via the sorcery API.

	  Unit tests have also been added to cover the respective
	  ast_bucket/ast_bucket_file clone and staleness operations.

	    sorcery objects are immutable, this can be used by sorcery wizards to
	    determine if an object is stale.

	  * A new API call has been added, ast_sorcery_is_stale. This API call
	    queries the wizards associated with the object, calling a new callback
	    function 'is_stale'. Note that if a wizard does not support the new
	    callback, objects are always assumed to not be stale.

	* res_sorcery_realtime: Fix leak of sorcery object type.

	  This prevents a leak of a sorcery object type when realtime sorcery
	  objects are retrieved by fields or when multiple objects are retrieved.

	  The extent of this leak is that sorcery object types would be leaked.
	  These are allocated whenever an object type is registered with sorcery,
	  meaning that on module shutdown, these objects would be leaked. This
	  could be problematic if many reloads were performed, but it is not as
	  severe as if every sorcery object retrieved from realtime were being
	  leaked.

	* res/res_corosync: Always decline module load, instead of failing

	  Returns a 'failure' from the module load routine indicates to Asterisk
	  that it should abort loading completely. This is rarely - in fact,
	  really, never - a good option. Aborting load of Asterisk from a dynamic
	  module implies that the core, and the rest of the dynamic modules, don't
	  matter: we should abandon all processing.

	  res_corosync is really not that important.

	  This patch updates the module such that, if it fails to load, it
	  politely declines (emitting ERROR messages along the way), and allows
	  Asterisk to continue to function.

	  Note that this issue was keeping Asterisk unit tests from running on
	  certain build agents.

	* main/pbx: Resolve case sensitivity regression in PBX hints

	  When 8297136f was merged for ASTERISK-25040, a regression was introduced
	  surrounding the case sensitivity of device names within hints.
	  Previously, device names - such as 'sip/foo' - were compared in a case
	  insensitive fashion. Thus, 'sip/foo' was equivalent to 'SIP/foo'. After
	  that patch, only the case sensitive name would match, i.e., 'SIP/foo'.
	  As a result, some dialplan hints stopped working.

	  This patch re-introduces case insensitive matching for device names in
	  hints.

	* res_pjsip_nat: Adjust when contact should be rewritten.

	  A previous change made the contact only get rewritten if the dialog's
	  route set was not marked frozen. Unfortunately, while the intent of this
	  is correct, the dialog's route set actually gets marked as frozen
	  earlier than expected, especially for UAS dialogs.

	  Instead, the idea is that the contact needs to not be rewritten if there
	  is a pre-existing route set on the dialog. This is now accomplished by
	  checking the dialog's route set list instead of checking if the route
	  set is frozen.

	  Doing this causes some broken tests to begin passing again.

	* res_pjsip_nat: Rewrite route set when required.

	  When performing some provider testing, the rewrite_contact option was
	  interfering with proper construction of a route set when sending an ACK
	  after receiving a 200 OK response to an INVITE.

	  The initial INVITE was sent to address sip:foo. The 200 OK had a Contact
	  header with URI sip:bar. In addition, the 200 OK had Record-Route
	  headers for sip:baz and sip:foo, in that order. Since the Record-Route
	  headers had the lr parameter, the result should have been:

	  * Set R-URI of the ACK to sip:bar.
	  * Add Route headers for sip:foo and sip:baz, in that order.

	  However, the rewrite_contact option resulted in our rewriting the
	  Contact header on the 200 OK to sip:foo. The result was:

	  * R-URI remained sip:foo.
	  * We added Route headers for sip:foo and sip:baz, in that order.

	  The result was that sip:bar was not indicated in the ACK at all, so the
	  far end never received our ACK. The call eventually dropped.

	  The intention of rewrite_contact is to rewrite the most immediate
	  destination of our SIP request to be the same address on which we
	  received a request or response. In the case of processing a SIP response
	  with Record-Route headers, this means that instead of rewriting the
	  Contact header, we should instead rewrite the bottom-most Record-Route
	  header. In the case of processing a SIP request with Record-Route
	  headers, this means we rewrite the top-most Record-route header.
	  Like when we rewrite the Contact header, we also ensure to update
	  the dialog's route set if it exists.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration.c: Fix handle_client_state_destruction() refs

	  * handle_client_state_destruction() must always be passed a ref to
	  client_state because it will always unref client_state.
	  handle_registration_response() was not passing a client_state ref.

	  * Made the final un-REGISTER message get sent normally using the pjproject
	  register control structure in handle_client_state_destruction().  The
	  previous code attempted to short circuit the response handling for the
	  module to unload.  That doesn't work for a couple reasons.  One,
	  pjsip_regc_send() may call the registered callback before it returns and
	  unbalance the client_state ref count.  Two, the registered callback
	  handles any authentication for the un-REGISTER message.

	  * Made the distinction between internal registration state and external
	  registration status with sip_outbound_registration_status_str().  This is
	  necessary to avoid altering documented AMI messages with internal
	  changes.

	  * Removed references to client_state->client outside of the serializer
	  thread.  When handle_client_state_destruction() destroys the pjproject
	  register control structure that memory is freed and cannot be referenced
	  anymore.  These accesses were to provide information for debug and
	  off-nominal warning messages.

	  * In sip_outbound_registration_timer_cb() you should not access entry->id
	  after unrefing client_state because the passed in entry is normally
	  pointing to the timer entry in the client_state object.

	* channel: Remove ignore of answer on non-outgoing channels.

	  Due to the way that channels can now be moved around inside of
	  Asterisk it is possible for the outgoing flag of a channel to get

	  not receiving notification that the outgoing leg has been answered.

	  This most easily exhibits itself with DTMF based blond transfers.

	  continues to receive both a locally generated ringing and the
	  media stream of the outgoing leg upon its answer. This results

	* Resolve race conditions involving Stasis bridges.

	  This resolves two observed race conditions.

	  First, a bit of background on what the Stasis application does:

	  1a Creates a stasis_app_control structure. This structure is linked into
	     a global container and can be looked up using a channel's unique ID.
	  2a Puts the channel in an event loop. The event loop can exit either
	     because the stasis_app_control structure has been marked done, or
	     because of some other factor, such as a hangup. In the event loop, the
	     stasis_app_control determines if any specific ARI commands need to be
	     run on the channel and will run them from this thread.
	  3a Checks if the channel is bridged. If the channel is bridged, then
	     ast_bridge_depart() is called since channels that are added to Stasis
	     bridges are always imparted as departable.
	  4a Unlink the stasis_app_control from the container.

	  When an ARI command is received by Asterisk, the following occurs
	  1b A thread is spawned to handle the HTTP request
	  2b The stasis_app_control(s) that corresponds to the channel(s) in the
	     request is/are retrieved. If the stasis_app_control cannot be
	     retrieved, then it is assumed that the channel in question has exited
	     the Stasis app or perhaps was never in Stasis in the first place.
	  3b A command is queued onto the stasis_app_control, and the channel's
	     event loop thread is signaled to run the command.
	  4b While most ARI commands do nothing further, some, such as adding or
	     removing channels from a bridge, will block until the command they
	     issued has been completed by the channel's event loop.

	  The first race condition that is solved by this patch involves a crash
	  that can occur due to faulty detection of the channel's bridged status
	  in step 3a. What can happen is that in step 2a, the event loop may run
	  the ast_bridge_impart() function to asynchronously place the channel
	  into a bridge, then immediately exit the event loop because the channel
	  has hung up. In step 3a, we would detect that the channel was not
	  bridged and would not call ast_bridge_depart(). The reason that the
	  channel did not appear to be bridged was that the depart_thread that is
	  spawned by ast_bridge_impart() had not yet started. That is the thread
	  where the channel is marked as being bridged. Since we did not call
	  ast_bridge_depart(), the Stasis application would exit, and then the
	  channel would be destroyed Then the depart_thread would start up and
	  try to manipulate the destroyed channel, causing a crash.

	  The fix for this is to switch from using ast_channel_is_bridged() to
	  checking the NULLity of ast_channel_internal_bridge_channel() to
	  determine if ast_bridge_depart() needs to be called. The channel's
	  internal bridge_channel is set when ast_bridge_impart() is called and
	  is NULLed by the call to ast_bridge_depart(). If the channel's internal
	  bridge_channel is non-NULL, then the channel must have been imparted
	  into the bridge and needs to be departed, even if the actual bridging
	  operation has not yet started. By departing the channel when necessary,
	  the thread that is running the Stasis application will block until the
	  bridge gives the okay that the depart_thread has exited.

	  The second race condition that is solved by this patch involves a leak
	  of HTTP handler threads. The problem was that step 2b would successfully
	  retrieve a stasis_app_control structure. Then step 2a would exit the
	  channel from the event loop due to a hangup. Steps 3a and 4a would
	  execute, and then finally steps 3b and 4b would. The problem is that at
	  step 4b, when attempting to add a channel to a bridge, the thread would
	  block forever since the channel would never execute the queued command
	  since it was finished with the event loop. This meant that the HTTP
	  handling thread would be leaked, along with any references that thread
	  may have owned (in my case, I was seeing bridges leaked).

	  The fix for this is to hone in better on when the channel has exited the
	  event loop. The stasis_app_control structure has an is_done field that
	  is now set at each point where the channel may exit the event loop. If
	  step 2b retrieves a valid stasis_app_control structure but the control
	  is marked as done, then the attempted operation exits immediately since
	  there will be nothing to service the attempted command.

	* main/cdr: Carry over the disable flag when 'disable all' is specified

	  The CDR_PROP function (as well as the NoCDR application) set the
	  'disable all' flag (AST_CDR_FLAG_DISABLE_ALL) on the current CDR. This
	  flag is supposed to be applied to all CDRs that are currently in the
	  chain, as well as all CDRs that may be created in the future. Currently,
	  however, the flag is only applied to the existing CDRs in the chain; new
	  CDRs do not receive the 'disable all' flag. In particular, this affects
	  parallel dials, which generate new CDRs for each pair of channels in
	  the dial attempt.

	  This patch carries over the 'disable all' flag when it is specified on a
	  CDR and a new CDR is generated for the chain.

	* main/cdr: Copy context/exten on chained CDRs for parallel dials in subroutines

	  When a parallel dial occurs, a new CDR will be created for each dial
	  attempt that is made. In most circumstances, the act of creating each
	  CDR in the chain will include a step that updates the Party A snapshot,
	  which causes the context/extension of the Party A to be copied onto the
	  CDR object.

	  However, when the Party A is in a subroutine, we explicitly do *not*
	  copy the context/extension onto the CDR. This prevents the Macro or
	  GoSub routine name from blowing away the context/extension that the
	  channel was originally executing in. For the original CDR, this is not a
	  problem: the original CDR already recorded the last known 'good' state
	  of the channel just prior to it going into the subroutine. However, for
	  newly generated CDRs in a chain, there is no context/extension set on
	  them. Since we are in a subroutine, we will never set the Party A's
	  context/extension on the CDR, and we end up with a CDR with no
	  destination recorded on it.

	  This patch updates the creation of a chained CDR such that it copies
	  over the original CDR's context/extension. This is the last known "good"
	  state of the CDR, and is a reasonable starting point for the newly
	  generated CDR. In the case where we are not in a subroutine, subsequent
	  code will update the location of the CDR from the Party A information;
	  in the case where we are in a subroutine, the context/extension on the
	  original CDR is the correct information.

	* chan_sip.c: Update dialog fromtag after request with auth

	  If a client sends and INVITE which is 401 rejected, then subsequently
	  sends a new INVITE with the auth info and uses a different fromtag
	  from the first INVITE, Asterisk will accept the new INVITE as part of
	  the original dialog - match_req_to_dialog() specifically ignores the
	  fromtag. However it does not update the stored dialog with the new
	  fromtag.

	  This results in Asterisk being unable to match future packets that are
	  part of this dialog (such as the ACK to the OK or the OK to the BYE),
	  and the call is dropped.

	  This problem was originally found when using an NEC-i SV8100-GE (NEC SIP
	  Card).

	  * After a successful match of a packet to the dialog, if the packet is
	    not a SIP_RESPONSE, authentication is present and the fromtags are
	    different, the stored fromtag is updated with the one from the recent
	    INVITE.

	* chan_pjsip: Set the context and extension on the channel when created

	  Prior to this patch, chan_pjsip was failing to pass the endpoint's
	  context and the desired extension to the ast_channel_alloc_* routine.
	  This caused a new channel snapshot to be issued without a context and
	  extension, which can cause some reporting issues for users of AMI, CEL,
	  and other APIs. The channel driver would later set the context and
	  extension on the channel such that the channel would start in the
	  correct location in the dialplan, but the information reported in the
	  initial event would be incorrect.

	  This patch modifies the channel driver such that it now passes the
	  context and extension directly into the allocation routine. This
	  provides the information in the new channel snapshot published over
	  Stasis.

	* bridge: When performing a blonde transfer update connected line information.

	  When performing a blonde transfer the code uses the old masquerade
	  mechanism to move a channel around. As a result of this certain information,
	  such as connected line, is moved between the channels involved. Upon
	  completion of the move a frame is queued which is supposed to update the
	  connected line information on the channel. This does not occur as the
	  code considers it a redundant update since the masquerade operation
	  updated the channel (but did not inform it of the new connected line
	  information). The code also does not queue a connected line update
	  to be handled by the thread handling the channel. Without this any
	  other channel that may be loosely involved does not know it is
	  talking to a different caller.

	  This change does the following to resolve this:

	  1. The indicated connected line information is cleared upon
	  completion of the masquerade operation when doing a blonde transfer.
	  This prevents the connected line update from being considered
	  redundant.

	  2. A connected line update frame is now queued upon the completion
	  of the masquerade operation so any other channel loosely involved
	  knows that there is a different caller.

	* DNS: Need to use the same serializer for a pjproject SIP transaction.

	  All send/receive processing for a SIP transaction needs to be done under
	  the same threadpool serializer to prevent reentrancy problems inside
	  pjproject when using an external DNS resolver to process messages for the
	  transaction.

	  * Add threadpool API call to get the current serializer associated with
	  the worker thread.

	  * Pick a serializer from a pool of default serializers if the caller of
	  res_pjsip.c:ast_sip_push_task() does not provide one.

	  This is a simple way to ensure that all outgoing SIP request messages are
	  processed under a serializer.  Otherwise, any place where a pushed task is
	  done that would result in an outgoing out-of-dialog request would need to
	  be modified to supply a serializer.  Serializers from the default
	  serializer pool are picked in a round robin sequence for simplicity.

	  A side effect is that the default serializer pool will limit the growth of
	  the thread pool from random tasks.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.

	  * Made pjsip_resolver.c use the requesting thread's serializer to execute
	  the async callback.

	  * Made pjsip_distributor.c save the thread's serializer name on the
	  outgoing request tdata struct so the response can be processed under the
	  same serializer.

	* res_pjsip_transport_websocket: Fix use-after-free bugs.

	  This patch fixes use-after-free bugs caught by AddressSanitizer.

	  1. PJSIP transport manager may decide to destroy transport on its own.
	  For example, when the contact registered via websocket has not renewed
	  its registration in time. The transport was destoyed, but the websocket
	  listener thread was still active until the socket closes, and then tried
	  to call transport_shutdown on transport that has been freed.

	  Also, the transport destructor accessed wstransport->rdata.tp_info.pool
	  right after freeing memory that contained wstransport itself.

	  This patch converts transport to an ao2 object, allowing it to be
	  refcounted, so that it is available until both websocket listener and
	  pjsip transport manager are finished with it.

	  2. The websocket listener deletes the last reference on websocket session
	  when the tcp connection is closed, and it gets destroyed, but
	  the transport manager may still use it, for example when disconnect
	  happens in the middle of a SIP transaction.

	  A new reference to websocket session has been added that is released
	  with the transport to prevent this.

	* AMI: Escape string values.

	  So this issue is a bit complicated. Since it is possible to pass values to AMI
	  that contain a '\r\n' (or other similar sequences) these values need to be
	  escaped. One way to solve this is to escape the values and then pass the escaped
	  values to the AMI variable parameter string building function. However, this
	  puts the onus on the pre-build function to escape all string values. This
	  potentially requires a fair amount of changes along with a lot of string
	  allocations/freeing for all values.

	  Surely there is a way to push this complexity down a level into the string
	  building function itself? This of course is possible, but ends up requiring a
	  way to distinguish between strings that need to be escaped and those that don't.
	  The best way to handle this is by introducing a new format specifier in the
	  format string. For instance a %s (no escape) and %S (escape). However, that is
	  a bit weird and unexpected.

	  So faced with those possibilities this patch implements a limited version of the
	  first option. Instead of attempting to escape all string values this patch only
	  escapes those values that make sense. This approach limits the number of changes
	  and doesn't suffer from the odd format specifier problem.

	* res_pjsip_session: Fix in-dialog authentication.

	  When the remote peer requires authentication for in-dialog requests then
	  re-INVITEs to the peer cause the call to be disconnected and other
	  in-dialog requests to the peer like MESSAGE just don't go through.

	  * Made session_inv_on_tsx_state_changed() handle in-dialog authentication
	  for re-INVITEs and other methods.  Initial INVITEs cannot be handled here
	  because the INVITE transaction must be restarted earlier.

	  * Pulled needed code from res/res_pjsip/pjsip_outbound_auth.c in
	  preparation for removing the file.  The generic outbound authentication
	  code did not work as well as anticipated.

	  * Created outbound_invite_auth() to only handle initial outbound INVITEs.
	  Re-INVITEs cannot be handled here.  The re-INVITE transaction is still in
	  progress and the PJSIP library cannot handle the overlapping INVITE
	  transactions.  Other method types should not be handled here as this code
	  only works on outgoing calls and we need to handle incoming and outgoing
	  calls.

	* endpoint/stasis: Eliminate duplicate events on endpoint status change

	  When an endpoint was created, it's messages were being forwarded to
	  both the tech endpoint topic and the all endpoints topic.  Since
	  the tech topic was also forwarded to all, this was resulting in
	  duplicate messages whenever an endpoint published.  This patch
	  causes the endpoint to only forward to the tech topic and lets
	  the tech topic forward to all.

	  To accomplish this, the existing stasis_cp_single_create function
	  (which both creates and forwards) was cloned and split into 2
	  functions, one that creates the topic and one that sets up the
	  forwarding.  This allows endpoint_internal_create to create
	  the topic from the endpoint_all cache without forwarding it there,
	  then allows it to do the forward to the tech's topic.

	* res_sorcery_memory_cache: Add support for refreshing stale objects.

	  This change introduces a check of object_lifetime_stale when retrieving
	  cached objects. If the amount of time the object has been in the cache
	  exceeds the lifetime, then a task is scheduled to update the cached
	  object based on an object retrieved from other sorcery wizards instead.

	  To prevent the cached object from being retrieved during a refresh,
	  thread-local storage is used to mark the thread as being a stale object
	  update. This results in the cache returning no object, leading to
	  sorcery querying other wizards for the object instead.

	  A test has been added for stale objects as well. This test ensures that
	  stale objects are retrieved the same as freshly-cached objects. The test
	  also ensures that after an object is stale, changes in the backend are
	  reflected in the cache, to include if the object has been deleted from
	  the backend.

	* res/ari: Register Stasis application on WebSocket attempt

	  Prior to this patch, when a WebSocket connection is made, ARI would not
	  be informed of the connection until after the WebSocket layer had
	  accepted the connection. This created a brief race condition where the
	  ARI client would be notified that it was connected, a channel would be
	  sent into the Stasis dialplan application, but ARI would not yet have
	  registered the Stasis application presented in the HTTP request that
	  established the WebSocket.

	  This patch resolves this issue by doing the following:
	   * When a WebSocket attempt is made, a callback is made into the ARI
	     application layer, which verifies and registers the apps presented in
	     the HTTP request. Because we do not yet have a WebSocket, we cannot
	     have an event session for the corresponding applications. Some
	     defensive checks were thus added to make the application objects
	     tolerant to a NULL event session.
	   * When a WebSocket connection is made, the registered application is
	     updated with the newly created event session that wraps the WebSocket
	     connection.

	* res_pjsip: Refactor endpt_send_transaction (qualify_timeout)

	  This patch refactors the transaction timeout processing to eliminate
	  calling the lower level public pjsip functions and reverts to calling
	  pjsip_endpt_send_request again.  This is the result of me noticing
	  a possible incompatibility with pjproject-2.4 which was causing
	  contact status flapping.

	  The original version of this feature used the lower level calls to
	  get access to the tsx structure in order to cancel the transaction
	  when our own timer expires. Since we no longer have that access,
	  if our own timer expires before the pjsip timer, we call the callbacks
	  and just let the pjsip transaction take it's own course.  When the
	  transaction ends, it discovers the callbacks have already been run
	  and just cleans itself up.

	  A few messages in pjsip_configuration were also added/cleaned up.

	* res_sorcery_memory_cache: Add support for object_lifetime_maximum.

	  This makes the "object_lifetime_maximum" option operational.

	  On the addition of an object to an empty memory cache a scheduled
	  task is created which, when invoked, expires objects from the cache
	  which have exceeded their lifetime. If more objects have been added
	  the remaining life of the oldest object is used to schedule the
	  next invocation of the scheduled task.

	  If the oldest object is removed from the cache before it can be
	  expired automatically the scheduled task is cancelled, if possible,
	  and the lifetime of the next oldest is used to schedule the task.

	  If during these two operations no additional objects exist in the
	  cache then no task is scheduled.

	* audiohook.c: Difference in read/write rates caused continuous buffer resets

	  Currently, everytime a sample rate change occurs (on read or write) the

	  attempted, but before we accept it. Consumers can choose to reject the
	  connection, if their application specific logic allows for it.

	  As a result, this patch pulls out the previously private
	  websocket_protocol struct and makes it public, as
	  ast_websocket_protocol. In order to preserve backwards compatibility
	  with existing modules, the existing APIs were left as-is, and new APIs
	  were added for the creation of the ast_websocket_protocol as well as for
	  adding a sub-protocol to a WebSocket server.

	  In particular, the following new API calls were added:
	  * ast_websocket_add_protocol2 - add a protocol to the core WebSocket
	    server
	  * ast_websocket_server_add_protocol2 - add a protocol to a specific
	    WebSocket server
	  * ast_websocket_sub_protocol_alloc - allocate a sub-protocol object.
	    Consumers can populate this with whatever callbacks they wish to
	    support, then add it to the core server or a specified server.

	  * A number of files incorrectly places a '\brief' tag immediately after

	* tcptls: Enable multiple TLS certificate chains (RSA+ECC+DSA) for server socket.

	  When a client connects to a server via SSL/TLS, the server commonly utilizes an

	  the server socket is configured with a certificate for either one of those, it
	  would lose its compatibility with RSA-only clients.

	  Now, the server socket can be configured with up to one RSA, ECDSA and DSA key
	  each. For example, if a client is not compatible with SHA-2 hashed certificates
	  like Nokia mobile phones, the server socket still can use RSA/SHA-1 for legacy
	  clients and ECDSA/SHA-2 for everyone else.

	* MALLOC_DEBUG: Replace WRAP_LIBC_MALLOC with ASTMM_LIBC.

	  There are 3 ways that calls directly to standard allocator functions can
	  be dealt with:
	  1. Block their use, cause them to generate an error.  This is the default.
	  2. Replace them with the Asterisk equivalent function calls.
	  3. Leave them alone.

	  This change allows one of these 3 options to be selected by any source.
	  The source just needs to define ASTMM_LIBC to ASTMM_BLOCK, ASTMM_REDIRECT,
	  or ASTMM_IGNORE to use option 1, 2 or 3 respectively.  Normally ASTMM_BLOCK
	  is the correct option, so it is default when ASTMM_LIBC is not defined.
	  In some cases when building 3rd party code it is desirable to have it use
	  Asterisk functions, without changing the whole source - ASTMM_REDIRECT
	  accomplishes this.  When using 3rd party libraries sometimes a static
	  inline function will make use of malloc or free.  In these cases it may
	  be unsafe to replace the allocator in the header, as it's possible the
	  memory could be freed by the library using standard allocators.  For
	  those cases ASTMM_IGNORE is needed.

	* Allow command-line options to override asterisk.conf.

	  Previous versions of Asterisk processed command-line options before
	  processing asterisk.conf.  This meant that if an option was set in
	  asterisk.conf, it could not be overridden with the equivelent command
	  line option.  This change causes Asterisk to process the command-line
	  twice.  First it processes options that are needed to load asterisk.conf,
	  then it processes the remaining options after the config is read.

	  This changes the function of -X slightly.  Previously using -X without
	  disabling execincludes in asterisk.conf caused #exec to be usable in any
	  config.  Now -X only enables #exec for the load of asterisk.conf, if it
	  is wanted in the rest of the system it must be enabled with execincludes
	  in asterisk.conf.  Updated 'asterisk -h' and 'man asterisk' to reflect
	  the limited function of -X.

	  This switches codecs/lpc10/lpcini.c back to including "asterisk.h"
	  instead of <stdlib.h>.  lpcini.c allocates memory that is freed by
	  codec_lpc10.c, so it is important to use MALLOC_DEBUG allocator.

	* res_pjsip_exten_state: Fix race condition between sending NOTIFY and termination

	  The res_pjsip_exten_state module currently has a race condition between
	  processing the extension state callback from the PBX core and processing
	  the subscription shutdown callback from res_pjsip_pubsub. There is currently
	  no synchronization between the two. This can present a problem as while
	  the SIP subscription will remain valid the tree it points to may not.
	  This is in particular a problem as a task to send a NOTIFY may get queued
	  which will try to use the tree that may no longer be valid.

	  This change does the following to fix this problem:

	  1. All access to the subscription tree is done within the task that
	  sends the NOTIFY to ensure that no other thread is modifying or
	  destroying the tree. This task executes on the serializer for the
	  subscriptions.

	  2. A reference to the subscription serializer is kept to ensure it
	  remains valid for the lifetime of the extension state subscription.

	  3. The NOTIFY task has been changed so it will no longer attempt
	  to send a NOTIFY if the subscription has already been terminated.

	* vector:  Additional enhancements and fixes

	  After using the new vector stuff for real I found...

	  A bug in AST_VECTOR_INSERT_AT that could cause a seg fault.

	  The callbacks needed to be closer to ao2_callback in behavior
	  WRT to CMP_MATCH and CMP_STOP behavior and the ability to return
	  a vector of matched entries.

	  A pre-existing issue with APPEND and REPLACE was also fixed.

	  I also added a new macro to test.h that acts like ast_test_validate
	  but also accepts a return code variable and a cleanup label.  As well
	  as printing the error, it sets the rc variable to AST_TEST_FAIL and
	  does a goto to the specified label on error.  I had a local version
	  of this in test_vector so I just moved it.

	* res_stasis_snoop: Spying on a single direction continually increases CPU

	  Creating a snoop channel in ARI and spying only on a single direction (in or
	  out) results in CPU utilization continually increasing until the CPU is fully
	  consumed. This occurs because frames are being put in the opposing direction's
	  slin factory queue, but not being removed.

	  Fixed the problem by always reading and disposing of frames from the opposite
	  queue of the direction selected.

	* features: Fix crash when transferee hangs up during DTMF attended transfer.

	  A crash happens with this sequence of steps:
	  1) Party A is connected to party B.
	  2) Party B starts a DTMF attended transfer.
	  3) Party A hangs up while party B is dialing party C.

	  When party A hangs up the bridge that party A and party B are in is
	  dissolved and party B is kicked out of the bridge.  When party B finishes
	  dialing party C he attempts to move to the new bridge with party C.  Since
	  party B is no longer in a bridge the attempted move dereferences a NULL
	  bridge_channel pointer and crashes.

	  * Made the hold(), unhold(), ringing(), and the bridge_move() functions
	  tolerant of the channel not being in a bridge.  The assertion that party B
	  is always in a bridge is not true if the bridged peer of party B hangs up
	  and dissolves the bridge.  Being tolerant of not being in a bridge allows
	  the peer hangup stimulus to be processed by the FSM.

	  * Made the bridge_move() function return void since where the return value
	  for a failed move was checked generated a FSM coding ERROR message for a
	  normal off-nominal condition.

	  * Eliminated most uses of RAII_VAR in bridge_basic.c.

	* stasis: Fix dial masquerade datastore lifetime

	  A recent change went into Asterisk which added reference counts to the
	  channels stored in a dial masquerade datastore. Unfortunately this
	  included a reference to the caller in a dialing operation. While all
	  of the dialed targets have the datastore removed from them upon dialing
	  completion this did not occur for the caller, causing it to have a
	  reference to itself that could go never go away (as it depended on
	  the destruction of the datastore which only happened when the channel
	  was destroyed). This resulted in the caller channel remaining on the
	  system despite it having hung up.

	  This change does the following to fix this issue:

	  1. The dial masquerade datastore is now removed from the caller upon
	  dialing completion, just like the dialed targets.
	  2. Upon destruction of the caller all the dialed targets are also
	  removed from the dial masquerade datastore (just in case).
	  3. The reference to the caller has been removed as it should not be
	  possible for the datastore to now be valid/useful after the lifetime
	  of the caller has ended.

	* Update configure.ac/Makefile for clang

	  Created autoconf/ast_check_raii.m4: contains AST_CHECK_RAII which
	  checks compiler requirements for RAII:
	  gcc: -fnested-functions support
	  clang: -fblocks (and if required -lBlocksRuntime)
	  The original check was implemented in configure.ac and now has it's
	  own file. This function also sets C_COMPILER_FAMILY to either gcc or
	  clang for use by makefile

	  Created autoconf/ast_check_strsep_array_bounds.m4 (contains
	  AST_CHECK_STRSEP_ARRAY_BOUNDS):
	  which checks if clang is able to handle the optimized strsep & strcmp
	  functions (linux). If not, the standard libc implementation should be
	  used instead. Clang + the optimized macro's work with:
	  strsep(char *, char []), but not with strsepo(char *, char *).
	  Instead of replacing all the occurences throughout the source code,
	  not using the optimized macro version seemed easier

	  See 'define __strcmp_gc(s1, s2, l2) in bits/string2.h':
	  llvm-comment: Normally, this array-bounds warning are suppressed for
	  macros, so that unused paths like the one that accesses __s1[3] are
	  not warned about.  But if you preprocess manually, and feed the
	  result to another instance of clang, it will warn about all the
	  possible forks of this particular if statement. Instead of switching
	  of this optimization, another solution would be to run the preproces-
	  sing step with -frewrite-includes, which should preserve enough
	  information so that clang should still be able to suppress the diag-
	  nostic at the compile step later on.

	* Astobj2: Fix initialization order of refdebug and AO2_DEBUG.

	  This ensures that refdebug is initialized before AO2_DEBUG if
	  both are enabled, since AO2_DEBUG allocates a container.

	  This change also makes AO2_DEBUG initialization critical, a
	  failure will abort Asterisk startup.  This is needed since
	  the failure would be caused by reg_containers allocation
	  failure, and that would result in a segmentation fault by
	  ao2_container_register later in startup.

	* main/pbx: Improve performance of dialplan reloads with a large number of hints

	  The PBX core maintains two hash tables for hints: a container of the
	  actual hints (hints), along with a container of devices that are watching that
	  hint (hintdevices). When a dialplan reload occurs, each hint in the hints
	  container is destroyed; this requires a lookup in the container of devices to
	  find the device => hint mapping object. In the current code, this performs an
	  ao2_callback, iterating over each of the device to hint objects in the
	  hintdevices container. For a large number of hints, this is extremely
	  expensive: dialplan reloads with 20000 hints could take several minutes
	  in just this phase.

	  This patch improves the performance of this step in the dialplan reloads
	  by caching which devices are watching a hint on the hint object itself.
	  Since we don't want to create a circular reference, we just cache the
	  name of the device. This allows us to perform a smarter ao2_callback on
	  the hintdevices container during hint removal, hashing on the name of the
	  device and returning an iterator to the matching names. The overall
	  performance improvement is rather large, taking this step down to a number of
	  seconds as opposed to minutes.

	  In addition, this patch also registers the hint containers in the PBX
	  core with the astobj2 library. This allows for reasonable debugging to
	  hash collisions in those containers.

	* Prevent potential crash on blond transfer.

	  Scenario:
	  Alice calls Bob. Bob performs a blond transfer to Carol. Carol rejects
	  the incoming call (or some other immediate circumstance causes Carol not
	  to answer the call)

	  What occurs in this case is that when the bridge between Alice and Bob
	  breaks, Alice is told to masquerade into Bob's channel that had placed
	  the call to Carol. The actual masquerade goes down without a hitch.
	  However, a channel fixup callback that attempts to publish dial events
	  over Stasis has a crash. The reason for this crash is that the datastore
	  on Bob's channel that placed the outbound call to Carol only had a bare
	  pointer to Carol's channel. Since Carol rejected the incoming call,
	  Carol's channel has been hung up and freed, meaning accessing her
	  channel results in a crash.

	  The fix here is simple. The dial fixup code has been altered to hold
	  references to the involved channels and to drop those references when
	  freeing data.

	* Restrict functionality when ACLs are misconfigured.

	  This patch has two main purposes:

	  1) Improve warning messages when ACLs are configured improperly.
	  2) Prevent misconfigured ACLs from allowing potentially unwanted
	  traffic.

	  To acomplish point (2) in most cases, whatever configuration object that
	  the ACL belonged to was not allowed to load.

	  The one exception is res_pjsip_acl. In that case, ACLs are their own
	  configuration object. Furthermore, the module loading code has no
	  indication that a ACL configuration had a failure. So the tactic taken
	  here is to create an ACL that just blocks everything.

	* chan_dahdi: Add the chan_dahdi.conf force_restart_unavailable_chans option.

	  Some telco switches occasionally ignore ISDN RESTART requests.  The fix
	  for ASTERISK-19608 added an escape clause for B channels in the restarting
	  state if the telco ignores a RESTART request.  If the telco fails to
	  acknowledge the RESTART then Asterisk will assume the telco acknowledged
	  the RESTART on the second call attempt requesting the B channel by the
	  telco.  The escape clause is good for dealing with RESTART requests in
	  general but it does cause the next call for the restarting B channel to be
	  rejected if the telco insists the call must go on that B channel.

	  chan_dahdi doesn't really need to issue a RESTART request in response to
	  receiving a cause 44 (Requested channel not available) code.  Sending the
	  RESTART in such a situation is not required (nor prohibited) by the
	  standards.  I think chan_dahdi does this for historical reasons to deal
	  with buggy peers to get channels unstuck in a similar fashion as the
	  chan_dahdi.conf resetinterval option.

	  * Add the chan_dahdi.conf force_restart_unavailable_chans compatability
	  option that when disabled will prevent chan_dahdi from trying to RESTART
	  the channel in response to a cause 44 code.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Fix double unref on error return.

	  When the PJSIP pjsip_regc_send function is invoked and an error
	  status returned the caller currently decrements the reference count
	  of the client state that it just incremented, assuming the
	  registration callback would not have been invoked. In practice
	  this is not correct. If the failure happens after the transaction
	  has been set up the callback will still be invoked. This will
	  cause the reference count to be incorrectly decremented twice, once
	  by the registration callback and second by the caller of
	  pjsip_regc_send.

	  This change makes it so that whether the callback is invoked or
	  not is known by the caller of pjsip_regc_send. Depending on
	  this it can know whether it is responsible for decrementing the
	  reference count of the client state or not.

	* res_fax: allow 2400 transmission rate according to v.27ter standard

	  A previous set of patches (see: ASTERISK-22790 & ASTERISK-23231) made it so
	  a v.27 modem was not allowed to have a minimum transmission rate of 2400 bits
	  per second. This reverts all or some of those patches since according to the

	  One of the original patches also added 9600 bits per second support for v.27.
	  This patch also removes that since v.27ter only supports 2400/4800 bits per
	  second.

	  Also, since Asterisk specifically supports v.27ter the enum was renamed to
	  better reflect this.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Don't fail on delayed processing.

	  Odd behaviors have been observed during outbound registrations. The most
	  common problem witnessed has been one where a request with
	  authentication credentials cannot be created after receiving a 401
	  response. Other behaviors include apparently processing an incorrect SIP
	  response.

	  Inspecting the code led to an apparent issue with regards to how we
	  handle transactions in outbound registration code. When a response to a
	  REGISTER arrives, we save a pointer to the transaction and then push a
	  task onto the registration serializer. Between the time that we save the
	  pointer and push the task, it's possible for the transaction to be
	  destroyed due to a timeout. It's also possible for the address to be
	  reused by the transaction layer for a new transaction.

	  To allow for authentication of a REGISTER request to be authenticated
	  after the transaction has timed out, we now hold a reference to the
	  original REGISTER request instead of the transaction. The function for
	  creating a request with authentication has been altered to take the
	  original request instead of the transaction where the original request
	  was sent.

	  request as a template. This means that the authenticated request will
	  have the same Call-ID, From header (including tag), and CSeq as the
	  original request. PJSIP generates a new branch on the Via header to
	  indicate that this is a new transaction, though.

	  There are some SIP implementations, though, that do not notice the
	  change in the branch and therefore will match the authed request to the
	  original request's transaction. Since the CSeq is the same, the server
	  will repeat the response it sent to the original request.

	  This patch aids interoperability by increasing the CSeq of the authed
	  request by one.

	* res_pjsip_t38: Don't crash on authenticated reinvite after originated T.38 FAX.

	  When Asterisk originates a channel to an application, the channel is
	  hung up once the application finishes executing. When the application
	  in question is SendFax, the Asterisk PJSIP code will attempt to reinvite
	  the T.38 session to audio after the FAX completes. The hangup of the
	  channel happens in the midst of this reinvite transaction. In most
	  circumstances, this works out okay because the BYE is delayed until the
	  reinvite transaction can complete.

	  However, if the reinvite that Asterisk sends receives a 401/407
	  response, then Asterisk's attempt to re-send the reinvite with
	  authentication will fail. This is because the session supplement in
	  res_pjsip_t38 makes the assumption that the channel on the session will
	  always be non-NULL. Since the channel has been hung up, though, the
	  channel is now NULL. Attempting to operate on the channel causes a
	  crash.

	  This patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the channel on the session
	  is not NULL before attempting to mess with the T.38 framehook.

	  This patch also contains some corrections for comments that were
	  incorrect and really confused me when I first started looking at the
	  code.

	  On some systems, res_corosync isn't compatible with the installed version of

	  and Asterisk terminates.  The work around has been to remember to add

	* dns: Make query sets hold on to queries for their lifetime.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Set the endpoint on SUBSCRIBE dialogs.

	  When SUBSCRIBE dialogs were established, we never associated
	  the endpoint that created the subscription with the dialog
	  we end up creating. In most cases, this ended up not causing
	  any problems.

	  The actual bug that was observed was that when a device that
	  was behind NAT established a subscription with Asterisk, Asterisk
	  would end up sending in-dialog NOTIFY requests to the device's
	  private IP addres instead of the public address of the NAT router.

	  When Asterisk receives the initial SUBSCRIBE from the device,
	  res_pjsip_nat rewrites the contact to the public address on which the
	  SUBSCRIBE was received. This allows for the dialog to have its target
	  address set to the proper public address. Asterisk then would send a 200
	  OK response to the SUBSCRIBE, then a NOTIFY with the initial
	  subscription state. The device would then send a 200 OK response to
	  Asterisk's NOTIFY.

	  Here's where things went wrong. When the 200 OK arrived, res_pjsip_nat
	  did not rewrite the address in the Contact header. Then, when the PJSIP
	  dialog layer processed the 200 OK, PJSIP would perform a comparison
	  between the IP address in the Contact header and its saved target
	  address for the dialog. Since they differed, PJSIP would update the
	  target dialog address to be the address in the Contact header. From this
	  point, if Asterisk needed to send a NOTIFY to the device, the result was
	  that the NOTIFY would be sent to the private address that the device
	  placed in the Contact header.

	  The reason why res_pjsip_nat did not rewrite the address when it
	  received the 200 OK response was that it could not associate the
	  incoming response with a configured endpoint. This is because on a
	  response, the only way to associate the response to an endpoint is by
	  finding the dialog that the response is associated with and then finding
	  the endpoint that is associated with that dialog. We do not perform
	  endpoint lookups on responses. res_pjsip_pubsub skipped the step of
	  associating the endpoint with the dialog we created, so res_pjsip_nat
	  could not find the associated endpoint and therefore couldn't rewrite
	  the contact.

	  This commit message is like 50x longer than the actual fix.

	* main/pbx: Don't attempt to destroy a previously destroyed exten/priority tuple

	  When a PBX registrar is unloaded, it will fail to remove its extension from
	  the context root_table if a dialplan application used by that extension is
	  still loaded. This can be the case for AGI, which can be unloaded after several
	  of the standard PBX providers. Often, this is harmless; however, if the
	  extension's priorities are removed during the failed unloading *and* the
	  dialplan application later unregisters, it leaves a ticking timebomb for the
	  next PBX provider that attempts to iterate over the extensions. When that
	  occurs, the peer_table pointer on the extension will already be set to NULL.
	  The current code does not check to see if the pointer is NULL before passing
	  it to a hashtab function this is not NULL tolerant.

	  Since it is possible for the peer_table to be NULL when we normally would not
	  expect that to be the case, the solution in this patch is to simply skip over
	  processing an extension's priorities if peer_table is NULL.

	  Prior to this patch, the tests/pbx/callerid_match test would crash during
	  module unload. With this patch, the test no longer crashes after running.

	* Detect potential forwarding loops based on count.

	  A potential problem that can arise is the following:

	  * Bob's phone is programmed to automatically forward to Carol.
	  * Carol's phone is programmed to automatically forward to Bob.
	  * Alice calls Bob.

	  If left unchecked, this results in an endless loops of call forwards
	  that would eventually result in some sort of fiery crash.

	  Asterisk's method of solving this issue was to track which interfaces
	  had been dialed. If a destination were dialed a second time, then
	  the attempt to call that destination would fail since a loop was
	  detected.

	  The problem with this method is that call forwarding has evolved. Some
	  SIP phones allow for a user to manually forward an incoming call to an
	  ad-hoc destination. This can mean that:

	  * There are legitimate use cases where a device may be dialed multiple
	  times, or
	  * There can be human error when forwarding calls.

	  This change removes the old method of detecting forwarding loops in
	  favor of keeping a count of the number of destinations a channel has
	  dialed on a particular branch of a call. If the number exceeds the
	  set number of max forwards, then the call fails. This approach has
	  the following advantages over the old:

	  * It is much simpler.
	  * It can detect loops involving local channels.
	  * It is user configurable.

	  The only disadvantage it has is that in the case where there is a
	  legitimate forwarding loop present, it takes longer to detect it.
	  However, the forwarding loop is still properly detected and the
	  call is cleaned up as it should be.

	  Address review feedback on gerrit.

	  * Correct "mfgium" to "Digium"
	  * Decrement max forwards by one in the case where allocation of the
	    max forwards datastore is required.
	  * Remove irrelevant code change from pjsip_global_headers.c

	* res_pjsip: Add global option to limit the maximum time for initial qualifies

	  Currently when Asterisk starts initial qualifies of contacts are spread out
	  randomly between 0 and qualify_timeout to prevent network and system overload.
	  If a contact's qualify_frequency is 5 minutes however, that contact may be
	  unavailable to accept calls for the entire 5 minutes after startup.  So while
	  staggering the initial qualifies is a good idea, basing the time on
	  qualify_timeout could leave contacts unavailable for too long.

	  This patch adds a new global parameter "max_initial_qualify_time" that sets the
	  maximum time for the initial qualifies.  This way you could make sure that all
	  your contacts are initialy, randomly qualified within say 30 seconds but still
	  have the contact's ongoing qualifies at a 5 minute interval.

	  If max_initial_qualify_time is > 0, the formula is initial_interval =
	  min(max_initial_interval, qualify_timeout * random().  If not set,
	  qualify_timeout is used.

	  The default is "0" (disabled).

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: On notify fail deleted sub_tree is then referenced

	  This change makes the send_notify of the sub_tree
	  not happen when the sub_tree has been deleted due
	  to the notify call failing, which avoids a crash.

	* pjsip_options: Add qualify_timeout processing and eventing

	  This is the second follow-on to https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4572/ and the
	  discussion at
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2015-March/073921.html

	  The basic issues are that changes in contact status don't cause events to be
	  emitted for the associated endpoint.  Only dynamic contact add/delete actions
	  update the endpoint.  Also, the qualify timeout is fixed by pjsip at 32 seconds
	  which is a long time.

	  This patch makes use of the new transaction timeout feature in r4585 and
	  provides the following capabilities...

	  1.  A new aor/contact variable 'qualify_timeout' has been added that allows the
	  user to specify the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a response to an
	  OPTIONS message.  The default is 3000ms.  When the timer expires, the contact is
	  marked unavailable.

	  2.  Contact status changes are now propagated up to the endpoint as follows...
	  When any contact is 'Available', the endpoint is marked as 'Reachable'.  When
	  all contacts are 'Unavailable', the endpoint is marked as 'Unreachable'.  The
	  existing endpoint events are generated appropriately.

	* res_pjsip: Refactor endpt_send_request to include transaction timeout

	  This is the first follow-on to https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4572/ and the
	  discussion at
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2015-March/073921.html

	  Since we currently have no control over pjproject transaction timeout, this
	  patch pulls the pjsip_endpt_send_request function out of pjproject and into
	  res_pjsip/endpt_send_transaction in order to implement that capability.

	  Now when the transaction is initiated, we also schedule our own pj_timer with
	  our own desired timeout.

	  If the transaction completes before either timeout, pjproject cancels its timer,
	  and calls our tsx callback where we cancel our timer and run the app callback.

	  If the pjproject timer times out first, pjproject calls our tsx callback where
	  we cancel our timer and run the app callback.

	  If our timer times out first, we terminate the transaction which causes
	  pjproject to cancel its timer and call our tsx callback where we run the app
	  callback.

	  Regardless of the scenario, pjproject is calling the tsx callback inside the
	  group_lock and there are checks in the callback to make sure it doesn't run
	  twice.

	  As part of this patch ast_sip_send_out_of_dialog_request was created to replace
	  its similarly named private function.  It takes a new timeout argument in
	  milliseconds (<= 0 to disable the timeout).

	  The Makefile claims that you can set default menuselect options by creating
	  ~/.asterisk.makeopts or /etc/asterisk.makeopts, but they are never read.
	  The rule for menuselect.makeopts is only allowed to run if the active target
	  is 'menuselect', but the menuselect target doesn't depend on
	  menuselect.makeopts.  A dot (wildcard character) was added so the rule will
	  be active for the targets that cause it to run: nmenuselect, cmenuselect,
	  and gmenuselect.

	* res_pjsip: Add external PJSIP resolver implementation using core DNS API.

	  This change adds the following:

	  1. A query set implementation. This is an API that allows queries to be executed in parallel and once all have completed a callback is invoked.
	  2. Unit tests for the query set implementation.
	  3. An external PJSIP resolver which uses the DNS core API to do NAPTR, SRV, AAAA, and A lookups.

	  For the resolver it will do NAPTR, SRV, and AAAA/A lookups in parallel. If NAPTR or SRV
	  are available it will then do more queries. And so on. Preference is NAPTR > SRV > AAAA/A,
	  with IPv6 preferred over IPv4. For transport it will prefer TLS > TCP > UDP if no explicit
	  transport has been provided. Configured transports on the system are taken into account to
	  eliminate resolved addresses which have no hope of completing.

	* build_tools/make_version: Update version parsing for Git migration

	  External systems - such as the Asterisk Test Suite - require knowledge of the
	  upstream branch. Unfortunately, after moving to Git, the Asterisk version
	  currently consists of only a 'GIT" prefix followed by an object blob,
	  e.g., GIT-as08d7. This makes it difficult for such systems to know what
	  features are available in a particular check out of Asterisk.

	  This patch fixes this by hardcoding the branch in a variable in the
	  make_version script. Since the mainline branches are not changed often -
	  typically only once a year - this is a reasonable approach to solving
	  the problem, and is more reliable than parsing the output of 'git branch
	  -vv'. Branches that track off of an upstream primary branch will then get the
	  benefit of knowing which mainline branch they are currently based off
	  of.

	* Optional API: Fix handling of sources that are both provider and user.

	  OPTIONAL_API has conditionals to define AST_OPTIONAL_API and
	  AST_OPTIONAL_API_ATTR differently based on if AST_API_MODULE is defined.
	  Unfortunately this is inside the include protection block, so only the
	  first status of AST_API_MODULE is respected.  For example res_monitor
	  is an optional API provider, but uses func_periodic_hook.  This makes
	  func_periodic_hook non-optional to res_monitor.

	  This changes optional_api.h so that AST_OPTIONAL_API and
	  AST_OPTIONAL_API_ATTR is redefined every time the header is included.

	* git migration: Refactor the ASTERISK_FILE_VERSION macro

	  Git does not support the ability to replace a token with a version
	  string during check-in. While it does have support for replacing a
	  token on clone, this is somewhat sub-optimal: the token is replaced
	  with the object hash, which is not particularly easy for human
	  consumption. What's more, in practice, the source file version was often
	  not terribly useful. Generally, when triaging bugs, the overall version
	  of Asterisk is far more useful than an individual SVN version of a file. As a
	  result, this patch removes Asterisk's support for showing source file
	  versions.

	  Specifically, it does the following:

	  * Rename ASTERISK_FILE_VERSION macro to ASTERISK_REGISTER_FILE, and
	    remove passing the version in with the macro. Other facilities
	    than 'core show file version' make use of the file names, such as
	    setting a debug level only on a specific file. As such, the act of
	    registering source files with the Asterisk core still has use. The
	    macro rename now reflects the new macro purpose.

	  * main/asterisk:
	    - Refactor the file_version structure to reflect that it no longer
	      tracks a version field.
	    - Remove the "core show file version" CLI command. Without the file
	      version, it is no longer useful.
	    - Remove the ast_file_version_find function. The file version is no
	      longer tracked.
	    - Rename ast_register_file_version/ast_unregister_file_version to
	      ast_register_file/ast_unregister_file, respectively.

	  * main/manager: Remove value from the Version key of the ModuleCheck
	    Action. The actual key itself has not been removed, as doing so would
	    absolutely constitute a backwards incompatible change. However, since
	    the file version is no longer tracked, there is no need to attempt to
	    include it in the Version key.

	  * UPGRADE: Add notes for:
	    - Modification to the ModuleCheck AMI Action
	    - Removal of the "core show file version" CLI command

	* chan_pjsip/res_pjsip/bridge_softmix/core: Improve translation path choices.

	  With this patch, chan_pjsip/res_pjsip now sets the native formats to the
	  codecs negotiated by a call.

	  * The changes in chan_pjsip.c and res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c set the native
	  formats to include all the negotiated audio codecs instead of only the
	  initial preferred audio codec and later the currently received audio
	  codec.

	  * The audio frame handling in channel.c:ast_read() is more streamlined and
	  will automatically adjust to changes in received frame formats.  The new
	  policy is to remove translation and pass the new frame format to the
	  receiver except if the translation was to a signed linear format.  A more
	  long winded version is commented in ast_read() along with some caveats.

	  * The audio frame handling in channel.c:ast_write() is more streamlined
	  and will automatically adjust any needed translation to changes in the
	  frame formats sent.  Frame formats sent can change for many reasons such
	  as a recording is being played back or the bridged peer changed the format
	  it sends.  Since it is a normal expectation that sent formats can change,
	  the codec mismatch warning message is demoted to a debug message.

	  * Removed the short circuit check in
	  channel.c:ast_channel_make_compatible_helper().  Two party bridges need to
	  make channels compatible with each other.  However, transfers and moving
	  channels among bridges can result in otherwise compatible channels having
	  sub-optimal translation paths if the make compatible check is short
	  circuited.  A result of forcing the reevaluation of channel compatibility
	  is that the asterisk.conf:transcode_via_slin and codecs.conf:genericplc
	  options take effect consistently now.  It is unfortunate that these two
	  options are enabled by default and negate some of the benefits to the
	  changes in channel.c:ast_read() by forcing translation through signed
	  linear on a two party bridge.

	  * Improved the softmix bridge technology to better control the translation
	  of frames to the bridge.  All of the incoming translation is now normally
	  handled by ast_read() instead of splitting any translation steps between
	  ast_read() and the slin factory.  If any frame comes in with an unexpected
	  format then the translation path in ast_read() is updated for the next
	  frame and the slin factory handles the current frame translation.

	  This is the final patch in a series of patches aimed at improving
	  translation path choices.  The other patches are on the following reviews:

	* res_pjsip_config_wizard: Cleanup load unload

	  While investigating other unload issues I realized that the load/unload process 
	  for the config wizard was pretty ugly so I've refactored it as follows...

	  When the res_pjsip sorcery instance is created the config_wizard bumps it's own 
	  module reference to prevent it from unloading while the sorcery instance is 
	  still active.  When res_pjsip unloads and it's sorcery instance is destroyed, 
	  the config wizard unrefs itself which then allows itself to unload cleanly.  
	  Since the config wizard now can't load after res_pjsip or unload before it 
	  (which should have been the correct behavior all along), I was able to remove 
	  the chunks of code in both load_module and unload_module that handled that case.

	  Ran the testsuite tests to insure there were no functional changes and REF_DEBUG 
	  to insure that Asterisk was shutting down cleanly with no FRACKs or leaks.

	* translate.c: Only select audio codecs to determine the best translation choice.

	  Given a source capability of h264 and ulaw, a destination capability of
	  h264 and g722 then ast_translator_best_choice() would pick h264 as the
	  best choice even though h264 is a video codec and Asterisk only supports
	  translation of audio codecs.  When the audio starts flowing, there are
	  warnings about a codec mismatch when the channel tries to write a frame to
	  the peer.

	  * Made ast_translator_best_choice() only select audio codecs.

	  * Restore a check in channel.c:set_format() lost after v1.8 to prevent
	  trying to set a non-audio codec.

	  This is an intermediate patch for a series of patches aimed at improving
	  translation path choices for ASTERISK-24841.

	  This patch is a complete enough fix for ASTERISK-21777 as the v11 version
	  of ast_translator_best_choice() does the same thing.  However, chan_sip.c
	  still somehow tries to call ast_codec_choose() which then calls
	  ast_best_codec() with a capability set that doesn't contain any audio
	  formats for the incoming call.  The remaining warning message seems to be
	  a benign transient.

	* res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider: Fix reference leak on unload

	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider was leaking references to phoneprov objects due to 
	  a missing OBJ_NODATA in an ao2_callback in load_users().  Rather than adding the 
	  OBJ_NODATA, I changed load_users to use a more straightforward ao2_iterator.  
	  This plugged the leak but exposed an unload order issue between 
	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider, res_phoneprov and res_pjsip.

	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider unloads first, then res_phoneprov, then res_pjsip.  
	  Since res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider uses res_pjsip's sorcery instance, when it 
	  unloads, it's objects are still in the sorcery instance.  When res_pjsip 
	  unloads, it destroys all its objects including res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider's.  
	  The phoneprov destructor then attempts to unregister the extension from 
	  res_phoneprov but because res_phoneprov is already cleaned up, its users 
	  container is gone and we get a FRACK.

	  Simple solution, check for the NULL users container before attempting to remove 
	  the entry. Duh.

	  Ran tests/res_phoneprov/res_phoneprov_provider.  No leaks in 
	  res_pjsip_phoneprov_provider and no FRACKs.

	* loader/main: Don't set ast_fully_booted until deferred reloads are processed

	  Until we have a true module management facility it's sometimes necessary for one 
	  module to force a reload on another before its own load is complete.  If 
	  Asterisk isn't fully booted yet, these reloads are deferred.  The problem is 
	  that asterisk reports fully booted before processing the deferred reloads which 
	  means Asterisk really isn't quite ready when it says it is.

	  This patch moves the report of fully booted after the processing of the deferred 
	  reloads is complete.

	  Since the pjsip stack has the most number of related modules, I ran the 
	  channels/pjsip testsuite to make sure there aren't any issues.  All tests 
	  passed.

	* Bridging: Eliminate the unnecessary make channel compatible with bridge operation.

	  When a channel enters the bridging system it is first made compatible with
	  the bridge and then the bridge technology makes the channel compatible
	  with the technology.  For all but the DAHDI native and softmix bridge
	  technologies the make channel compatible with the bridge step is an
	  effective noop because the other technologies allow all audio formats.
	  For the DAHDI native bridge technology it doesn't matter because it is not
	  an initial bridge technology and chan_dahdi allows only one native format
	  per channel.  For the softmix bridge technology, it is a noop at best and
	  harmful at worst because the wrong translation path could be setup if the
	  channel's native formats allow more than one audio format.

	  This is an intermediate patch for a series of patches aimed at improving
	  translation path choices.

	* Security/tcptls: MitM Attack potential from certificate with NULL byte in CN.

	  When registering to a SIP server with TLS, Asterisk will accept CA signed
	  certificates with a common name that was signed for a domain other than the
	  one requested if it contains a null character in the common name portion of
	  the cert. This patch fixes that by checking that the common name length
	  matches the the length of the content we actually read from the common name
	  segment. Some certificate authorities automatically sign CA requests when
	  the requesting CN isn't already taken, so an attacker could potentially
	  register a CN with something like www.google.com\x00www.secretlyevil.net
	  and have their certificate signed and Asterisk would accept that certificate
	  as though it had been for www.google.com - this is a security fix and is
	  noted in AST-2015-003.

	  be stored in a struct with an AF_INET6 address type. However, the current
	  NAT handling code won't handle the IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses correctly.
	  This patch adds an additional check for the mapped address case, allowing
	  the NAT code to handle clients even when the address is IPv6.

	* clang compiler warnings: Fix pointer-bool-converesion warnings

	  This patch fixes several warnings pointed out by the clang compiler.
	  * chan_pjsip: Removed check for data->text, as it will always be non-NULL.
	  * app_minivm: Fixed evaluation of etemplate->locale, which will always
	    evaluate to 'true'. This patch changes the evaluation to use
	    ast_strlen_zero.
	  * app_queue:
	    - Fixed evaluation of qe->parent->monfmt, which always evaluates to
	      true. Instead, we just check to see if the dereferenced pointer
	      evaluates to true.
	    - Fixed evaluation of mem->state_interface, wrapping it with a call to
	      ast_strlen_zero.
	  * res_smdi: Wrapped search_msg->mesg_desk_term with calls to ast_strlen_zero.

	* ARI: Add the ability to intercept hold and raise an event

	  For some applications - such as SLA - a phone pressing hold should not behave
	  in the fashion that the Asterisk core would like it to. Instead, the hold
	  action has some application specific behaviour associated with it - such as
	  disconnecting the channel that initiated the hold; only playing MoH to channels
	  in the bridge if the channels are of a particular type, etc.

	  One way of accomplishing this is to use a framehook to intercept the
	  hold/unhold frames, raise an event, and eat the frame. Tasty. This patch
	  accomplishes that using a new dialplan function, HOLD_INTERCEPT.

	  In addition, some general cleanup of raising hold/unhold Stasis messages was
	  done, including removing some RAII_VAR usage.

	  Versions of Asterisk prior to 12 defaulted to 8000 as a sample rate

	  The result was that some calculations which involve dividing by the

	  This is a change to align behavior with that of Asterisk 11 and previous versions.
	  In those versions, if a parked call were retrieved, and the call ended, the parked
	  call retriever would be hung up after the ParkedCall application ran. Prior to this
	  patch, in Asterisk 13, the same situation would result in the parked call retriever
	  falling through to additional priorities in the extension where the ParkedCall
	  application was called. With this patch, the behavior between Asterisk 11 and 13
	  aligns.

	* stasis: set a channel variable on websocket disconnect error

	  When an error occurs while writing to a web socket, the web socket is
	  disconnected and the event is logged. A side-effect of this, however, is that
	  any application on the other side waiting for a response from Stasis is left
	  hanging indefinitely (as there is no mechanism presently available for
	  notifying interested parties about web socket error states in Stasis).

	  To remedy this scenario, this patch introduces a new channel variable:
	  STASISSTATUS.

	  The possible values for STASISSTATUS are:
	  SUCCESS         - The channel has exited Stasis without any failures
	  FAILED          - Something caused Stasis to croak. Some (not all) possible
	                    reasons for this:
	                      - The app registry is not instantiated;
	                      - The app requested is not registered;
	                      - The app requested is not active;
	                      - Stasis couldn't send a start message

	* Fix an ABI compatibility issue with ast_log_safe for modules.

	  Binary modules are sometimes built against the latest release of
	  Asterisk in each branch, and need to be compatible with all
	  releases of that branch.  This change ensures that utils.h only
	  uses ast_log_safe from the core.  For modules and utilities ast_log
	  is used instead.

	* main/stdtime/localtime: Fix warning introduced in r433720

	  The patch in r433720 caused a warning to be kicked back by gcc. It occurred
	  due to this check in unistd.h:

	      if (__nbytes > __bos0 (__buf))
	          return __read_chk_warn (__fd, __buf, __nbytes, __bos0 (__buf));

	  That is, if __nbytes is greater than the result of GCC's built-in object size
	  for the struct, we'll kick back a warning.

	  As it turns out, this is because there is an error in the code in the patch.
	  We are passing the address of the pointer to the struct, not iev, which is a
	  pointer to the struct. Hence, the number of bytes is probably going to be lot
	  larger than the number of bytes that make up a pointer! This patch changes
	  the code just read from the pointer to the struct - which fixes the warning.

	* clang compiler warnings: Ignore -Wunused-command-line-argument

	  Assigning a variable to itself isn't super useful. However, the WAV format

	  Asterisk had an issue where retransmissions of MESSAGE requests resulted in
	  Asterisk processing the retransmission as if it were a new MESSAGE request.

	  This patch fixes the issue by creating a transaction in PJSIP on the incoming

	  will resend the response and Asterisk will not ever see the retransmission.

	* res/res_timing_kqueue: Update the module to conform to current timer API

	  This patch updates the kqueue timing module to conform to current timer API.

	  This fixes issues with using the kqueue timing source on Asterisk 13 on
	  FreeBSD 10. These issues include:

	  - Remove support for kevent64().  The values used to support Asterisk timers
	    fit within 32bits and so can be handled on all platforms via kevent().

	  - Provide debug logging for, but do not track, unacked events.  This matches
	    the behavior of all other timer implementations.

	  - Implement continuous mode by triggering and leaving active, a user event.
	    This ensures that the file descriptor for the timer returns immediately from
	    poll(), without placing the load of a high speed timer on the kernel.

	  - In kqueue_timer_get_max_rate(), don't overstate the capability of the timer.
	    On some platforms, UINT_MAX is greater than INTPTR_MAX, the largest integer
	    type kqueue supports for timers.

	  - In kqueue_timer_get_event(), assume the caller woke up from poll() and just
	    return the mode the timer is currently in. This matches all other timer
	    implementations.

	  - Adjust the test code now that unacked events are not tracked.

	* Improved and portable ast_log recursion avoidance

	  This introduces a new logger routine ast_log_safe.  This routine should be
	  used for all error messages in code that can be run as a result of ast_log.
	  ast_log_safe does nothing if run recursively.  All error logging in
	  astobj2.c, strings.c and utils.h have been switched to ast_log_safe.

	  This required adding support for raw threadstorage.  This provides direct
	  access to the void* pointer in threadstorage.  In ast_log_safe, NULL is used
	  to signify that this thread is not already running ast_log_safe, (void*)1 when
	  it is already running.  This was done since it's critical that ast_log_safe
	  do nothing that could log during recursion checking.

	* Replace most uses of ast_register_atexit with ast_register_cleanup.

	  Since 'core stop now' and 'core restart now' do not stop modules,
	  it is unsafe for most of the core to run cleanups.  Originally all
	  cleanups used ast_register_atexit, and were only changed when it
	  was shown to be unsafe.  ast_register_atexit is now used only when
	  absolutely required to prevent corruption and close child processes.

	  Exceptions that need to use ast_register_atexit:
	  * CDR: Flush records.
	  * res_musiconhold: Kill external applications.
	  * AstDB: Close the DB.
	  * canary_exit: Kill canary process.

	  This change adds an abstracted core DNS API which resembles the API described
	  here[1]. The API provides a pluggable mechanism for resolvers and also a
	  consistent view for records. Both synchronous and asynchronous queries are
	  supported.

	  This change also adds a res_resolver_unbound module which uses the libunbound
	  library to provide resolution.

	  Unit tests have also been written for all of the above to confirm the API and
	  functionality.

	* chan_pjsip: Add "rpid_immediate" option to prevent unnecessary "180 Ringing" messages.

	  Incoming PJSIP call legs that have not been answered yet send unnecessary
	  "180 Ringing" or "183 Progress" messages every time a connected line
	  update happens.  If the outgoing channel is also PJSIP then the incoming
	  channel will always send a "180 Ringing" or "183 Progress" message when
	  the outgoing channel sends the INVITE.

	  Consequences of these unnecessary messages:

	  * The caller can start hearing ringback before the far end even gets the
	  call.

	  * Many phones tend to grab the first connected line information and refuse
	  to update the display if it changes.  The first information is not likely
	  to be correct if the call goes to an endpoint not under the control of the
	  first Asterisk box.

	  When connected line first went into Asterisk in v1.8, chan_sip received an
	  undocumented option "rpid_immediate" that defaults to disabled.  When
	  enabled, the option immediately passes connected line update information
	  to the caller in "180 Ringing" or "183 Progress" messages as described
	  above.

	  * Added "rpid_immediate" option to prevent unnecessary "180 Ringing" or
	  "183 Progress" messages.  The default is "no" to disable sending the
	  unnecessary messages.

	* funcs/func_env: Fix regression caused in FILE read operation

	  When r432935 was merged, it did correctly fix a situation where a FILE read
	  operation on the middle of a file buffer would not read the requested length
	  in the parameters passed to the FILE function. Unfortunately, it would also
	  allow the FILE function to append more bytes than what was available in the
	  buffer if the length exceeded the end of the buffer length.

	  This patch takes the minimum of the remaining bytes in the buffer along with
	  the calculated length to append provided by the original patch, and uses
	  that as the length to append in the return result. This patch also updates
	  the unit tests with the scenarios that were originally pointed out in

	* various: cleanup issues found during leak hunt

	  In this collection of small patches to prevent
	  Valgrind errors are: fixes for reference leaks
	  in config hooks, evaluating a parameter beyond
	  bounds, and accessing a structure after a lock
	  where it could have been already free'd.

	* Audit ast_sockaddr_resolve() usage for memory leaks.

	  Valgrind found some memory leaks associated with ast_sockaddr_resolve().
	  Most of the leaks had already been fixed by earlier memory leak hunt
	  patches.  This patch performs an audit of ast_sockaddr_resolve() and found
	  one more.

	  * Fix ast_sockaddr_resolve() memory leak in
	  apps/app_externalivr.c:app_exec().

	  * Made main/netsock2.c:ast_sockaddr_resolve() always set the addrs
	  parameter for safety so the pointer will never be uninitialized on return.
	  The same goes for res/res_pjsip_acl.c:extract_contact_addr().

	  * Made functions that call ast_sockaddr_resolve() with RAII_VAR()
	  controlling the addrs variable use ast_free instead of ast_free_ptr to
	  provide better MALLOC_DEBUG information.

	* main/frame: Don't report empty disallow values as an error

	  In realtime, it is normal to have a database with both 'allow' and 'disallow'
	  columns in the schema. It is perfectly valid to have an 'allow' value of
	  '!all,g722,ulaw,alaw' and no 'disallow' value. Unlike in static conf files,
	  you can't *not* provide the disallow value. Thus, the empty disallow value
	  causes a spurious WARNING message, which is kind of annoying.

	  This patch makes it so that a 'disallow' value with no ... value ... is
	  ignored. Granted, you can still screw this up as well, as technically
	  specifying 'disallow=all,!ulaw' allows only ulaw, and then you would have no
	  'allow' value in your database. But really, why would you do that? WHY?

	* chan_pjsip/res_pjsip_callerid: Make Party ID handling simpler and consistent.

	  The res_pjsip modules were manually checking both name and number
	  presentation values when there is a function that determines the combined
	  presentation for a party ID struct.  The function takes into account if
	  the name or number components are valid while the manual code rarely
	  checked if the data was even valid.

	  * Made use ast_party_id_presentation() rather than manually checking party
	  ID presentation values.

	  * Ensure that set_id_from_pai() and set_id_from_rpid() will not return
	  presentation values other than what is pulled out of the SIP headers.  It
	  is best if the code doesn't assume that AST_PRES_ALLOWED and

	  privacy.

	  * Pulled the id->number.valid test from add_privacy_header() and

	  adding PAI/RPID headers earlier.

	  * Made update_connected_line_information() not send out connected line
	  updates if the connected line number is invalid.  Lower level code would
	  not add the party ID information and thus the sent message would be

	* main/audiohook: Update internal sample rate on reads

	  When an audiohook is created (which is used by the various Spy applications
	  and Snoop channel in Asterisk 13+), it initially is given a sample rate of
	  8kHz. It is expected, however, that this rate may change based on the media
	  that passes through the audiohook. However, the read/write operations on the
	  audiohook behave very differently.

	  When a frame is written to the audiohook, the format of the frame is checked
	  against the internal sample rate. If the rate of the format does not match
	  the internal sample rate, the internal sample rate is updated and a new SLIN
	  format is chosen based on that sample rate. This works just fine.

	  When a frame is read, however, we do something quite different. If the format
	  rate matches the internal sample rate, all is fine. However, if the rates
	  don't match, the audiohook attempts to "fix up" the number of samples that
	  were requested. This can result in some seriously large number of samples
	  being requested from the read/write factories.

	  Consider the worst case - 192kHz SLIN. If we attempt to read 20ms worth of
	  audio produced at that rate, we'd request 3840 samples (192000 / (1000 / 20)).
	  However, if the audiohook is still expecting an internal sample rate of 8000,
	  we'll attempt to "fix up" the requested samples to:

	    samples_converted = samples * (ast_format_get_sample_rate(format) /
	                                   (float) audiohook->hook_internal_samp_rate);

	    which is:

	    92160 = 3840 * (192000 / 8000)

	  This results in us attempting to read 92160 samples from our factories, as
	  opposed to the 3840 that we actually wanted. On a 64-bit machine, this
	  miraculously survives - despite allocating up to two buffers of length 92160
	  on the stack. The 32-bit machines aren't quite so lucky. Even in the case where
	  this works, we will either (a) get way more samples than we wanted; or (b) get
	  about 3840 samples, assuming the timing is pretty good on the machine.

	  Either way, the calculation being performed is wrong, based on the API users
	  expectations.

	  My first inclination was to allocate the buffers on the heap. As it is,
	  however, there's at least two drawbacks with doing this:
	  (1) It's a bit complicated, as the size of the buffers may change during the
	      lifetime of the audiohook (ew).
	  (2) The stack is faster (yay); the heap is slower (boo).

	  Since our calculation is flat out wrong in the first place, this patch fixes
	  this issue by instead updating the internal sample rate based on the format
	  passed into the read operation. This causes us to read the correct number of
	  samples, and has the added benefit of setting the audihook with the right
	  SLIN format.

	  Note that this issue was caught by the Asterisk Test Suite as a result of
	  r432195 in the 13 branch. Because this issue is also theoretically possible
	  in Asterisk 11, the change is being made here as well.

	* Add support for the clang compiler; update RAII_VAR to use BlocksRuntime

	  RAII_VAR, which is used extensively in Asterisk to manage reference counted
	  resources, uses a GCC extension to automatically invoke a cleanup function
	  when a variable loses scope. While this functionality is incredibly useful
	  and has prevented a large number of memory leaks, it also prevents Asterisk
	  from being compiled with clang.

	  This patch updates the RAII_VAR macro such that it can be compiled with clang.
	  It makes use of the BlocksRuntime, which allows for a closure to be created
	  that performs the actual cleanup.

	  Note that this does not attempt to address the numerous warnings that the clang
	  compiler catches in Asterisk.

	  Much thanks for this patch goes to:
	  * The folks on StackOverflow who asked this question and Leushenko for
	    providing the answer that formed the basis of this code:

	* res_pjsip: Fix pjsip.conf type=global object default value handling.

	  When a type=global section is not defined in pjsip.conf the global
	  defaults are not applied.  As a result the mandatory Max-Forwards header
	  is not added to SIP messages for res_pjsip/chan_pjsip.

	  The handling of pjsip.conf type=global objects has several problems:

	  1) If the global object is missing the defaults are not applied.

	  2) If the global object is missing the default_outbound_endpoint's default
	  value is not returned by ast_sip_global_default_outbound_endpoint().

	  3) Defines are needed so default values only need to be changed in one
	  place.

	  * Added a sorcery instance observer callback to check if there were any
	  type=global sections loaded.  If there were more than one then issue an
	  error message.  If there were none then apply the global defaults.

	  * Fixed ast_sip_global_default_outbound_endpoint() to return the
	  documented default when no type=global object is defined.

	  * Made defines for the global default values.

	  * Increased the default_useragent[] size because SVN version strings can
	  get lengthy and 128 characters may not be enough.

	  * Fixed an off-nominal code path ref leak in global_alloc() if the string
	  fields fail to initialize.

	  * Eliminated RAII_VAR in get_global_cfg() and
	  ast_sip_global_default_outbound_endpoint().

	* res/res_config_odbc: Fix improper escaping of backslashes with MySQL

	  When escaping backslashes with MySQL, the proper way to escape the characters
	  in a LIKE clause is to escape the '\' four times, i.e., '\\\\'. To quote the
	  MySQL manual:

	  "Because MySQL uses C escape syntax in strings (for example, “\n” to represent
	  a newline character), you must double any “\” that you use in LIKE strings.
	  For example, to search for “\n”, specify it as “\\n”. To search for “\”,
	  specify it as “\\\\”; this is because the backslashes are stripped once by the
	  parser and again when the pattern match is made, leaving a single backslash to
	  be matched against."

	* app_voicemail: Fix crash with IMAP backends when greetings aren't present

	  When an IMAP backend is in use and greetings are set to be used, but aren't
	  present for a user in their IMAP folder, Asterisk will crash. This occurs
	  due to the mailstream being set to the 'greetings' folder and being left
	  in that particular state, regardless of the success/failure of the attempt
	  to access the folder the mailstream points to. Later access of the mailstream
	  assumes that it points to the 'INBOX' (or some other folder), resulting in
	  either a crash (if the greetings folder didn't exist and the mailstream is
	  invalid) or an inability to read messages from the 'INBOX' folder.

	  This patch restores the mailstream to its correct state after accessing the
	  greetings. This fixes the crash, and sets the mailstream to the state that
	  VoiceMailMain expects.

	  Note that while ASTERISK-23390 also contained a patch for this issue, the
	  patch on ASTERISK-24786 is the one being merged here.

	* localtime: Fix file descriptor leak on kqueue(2) systems

	  The localtime management in the Asterisk core contains a thread that watches
	  for changes in the local timezone. On systems where the directory containing
	  /etc/localtime is modified frequently, the thread monitoring the changes will
	  be woken up to determine if any changes in timezone have occurred. When using
	  kqueue(2), this can cause a leak of file descriptors due to some improper
	  management of resources.

	  This patch updates the kqueue(2) handling in localtime, such that is no longer
	  leaks resources.

	* res_pjsip: allow configuration of endpoint identifier query order

	  It's possible to have a scenario that will create a conflict between endpoint
	  identifiers. For instance an incoming call could be identified by two different
	  endpoint identifiers and the one chosen depended upon which identifier module
	  loaded first. This of course causes problems when, for example, the incoming
	  call is expected to be identified by username, but instead is identified by ip.
	  This patch adds a new 'global' option to res_pjsip called
	  'endpoint_identifier_order'. It is a comma separated list of endpoint
	  identifier names that specifies the order by which identifiers are processed
	  and checked.

	* chan_dahdi/sig_analog: Fix distinctive ring detection to suck less.

	  The distinctive ring feature interferes with detecting Caller ID and
	  appears to have been broken for years.  What happens is if you have a
	  ring-ring cadence as used in the UK you get too many DAHDI events for the
	  distinctive ring pattern array and Caller ID detection is aborted.  I
	  think when Zapata/DAHDI added the ring begin event it broke distinctive
	  ring.  More events happen than before and the code does no filtering of
	  which event times are recorded in the pattern array.

	  * Made distinctive ring only record the ringt count when the ring ends
	  instead of on just any DAHDI event.  Distinctive ring can be ring,
	  ring-ring, ring-ring-ring, or different ring durations for the up to three
	  rings.

	  * Fixed the distinctive ring detection enable (chan_dahdi.conf option
	  usedistinctiveringdetection) to be per port instead of somewhat per port
	  and somewhat global.  This has been broken since v1.8.

	  * Fixed using the default distinctive ring context when the detected
	  pattern does not match any configured dringX patterns.  The default
	  context did not get set when the previous call was a matched distinctive
	  ring pattern and the current call is not matched.  This has been broken
	  since v1.8.

	  * Made distinctive ring have no effect on Caller ID detection when it is
	  disabled.  Caller ID detection just monitors for 10 seconds before giving
	  up.

	  * Fixed leak of struct callerid_state memory when a polarity reversal
	  during Caller ID detection causes the incoming call to be aborted.

	* translate: Prevent invalid memory accesses on fast shutdown

	  When a 'core restart now' or 'core stop now' is executed and a channel is
	  currently in a media operation, the translator matrix can be destroyed while a
	  channel is currently blocked on getting the best translation choice
	  (see ast_translator_best_choice). When the channel gets the mutex, the
	  translation matrix now has invalid memory, and Asterisk crashes.

	  This patch does two things:
	  (1) We now only clean up the translation matrix on a graceful shutdown. In that
	      case, there are no channels, and so there is no risk of this occurring.
	  (2) We also now set the __matrix and __indextable to NULL. In some initial
	      backtraces when this occurred, it looked as if there was a memory corruption
	      occurring, and it wasn't until we determined that something had restarted
	      Asterisk that the issue became clear. By setting these to NULL on shutdown,
	      it becomes a bit easier to determine why a crash is occurring.

	  Note that we could litter the code with NULL checks on the __matrix, but the
	  act of making the translation matrix cleaned up on shutdown should preclude
	  this issue from occurring in the first place, and this part of the code needs
	  to be as fast as possible.

	* Dial API: add self destruct option when complete

	  This patch adds a self-destruction option to the
	  dial api.  The usefulness of this is mostly when
	  using async mode to spawn a separate thread used
	  to handle the new call, while the calling thread
	  is allowed to go on about other business.

	  The only alternative to this option would be the
	  calling thread spawning a new thread, or hanging
	  around itself waiting to destroy the dial struct
	  after completion.

	  Example of use (minus error checking):

	    struct ast_dial *dial = ast_dial_create();

	    ast_dial_append(dial, "PJSIP", "200", NULL);

	    ast_dial_option_global_enable(dial, AST_DIAL_OPTION_ANSWER_EXEC, "Echo");
	    ast_dial_option_global_enable(dial, AST_DIAL_OPTION_SELF_DESTROY, NULL);

	    ast_dial_run(dial, NULL, 1);

	  The dial_run call will return almost immediately
	  after spawning the new thread to run and monitor
	  the dial.  If the call is answered, it is placed
	  into the echo app.  When completed, it will call
	  ast_dial_destroy() on the dial structure.

	  Note that any allocations made to pass values to
	  ast_dial_set_user_data() or dial options must be
	  free'd in a state callback function on any of:
	    AST_DIAL_RESULT_UNASWERED,
	    AST_DIAL_RESULT_ANSWERED,
	    AST_DIAL_RESULT_HANGUP, or 
	    AST_DIAL_RESULT_TIMEOUT.

	* channels/chan_sip: Don't send a BYE after final response when PBX thread fails

	  When Asterisk fails to start a PBX thread for a new channel - for example, when
	  the maxcalls setting in asterisk.conf is exceeded - we currently send a final
	  response, and then attempt to send a BYE request to the UA. Since that's all
	  sorts of wrong, this patch fixes that by setting sipalreadygone on the sip_pvt
	  such that we don't get stuck sending BYE requests to something that does not
	  want it.

	  Note that this patch is a slight modification of the one on ASTERISK-15434.
	  For clarity, it explicitly calls sipalreadygone with the calls to transmit a
	  final response.

	* channels/chan_sip: Clarify WARNING message in mismatched SRTP scenario

	  When we receive an SDP as part of an offer/answer for a peer/friend has been
	  configured to require encryption, and that SDP offer/answer failed to provide
	  acceptable crypto attributes, we currently issue a WARNING that uses the phrase
	  "we" and "requested". In this case, both of those terms are ambiguous - the
	  user will probably think "we" is Asterisk (it most likely isn't) and it may
	  not be a "request", so much as an SDP that was received in some fashion.

	  This patch makes the WARNING messages slightly less bad and a bit more
	  accurate as well.

	* channels/sip/sdp_crypto: Handle SRTP keys negotiated with key lifetime/MKI

	  Prior to this patch, SDP offers negotiating SDES-SRTP crypto attributes would
	  be rejected if those crypto attributes contained either a key lifetime or a
	  MKI parameter. While from a theoretical point of view this was defensible -
	  Asterisk does not support key lifetimes or multiple crypto keys - from a
	  practical point of view, this is quite a problem. A large number of endpoints
	  offer lifetimes/MKI, which Asterisk can tolerate so long as it doesn't actually
	  have to support anything more than a single key or refresh the key.
	  In reality, this is (so far as we've seen) always the case.

	  This patch is a forward port of Olle's work in the lingon-srtp-key-lifetime-1.8
	  branch. To quote Olle from ASTERISK-17721, it handles lifetime/MKI parameters
	  in the following fashion:

	  > The Lingon branch now handle lifetime and MKI parameters.
	  >
	  > We only accept lifetimes up to max for the crypto and higher than 10 hours
	  > for packetization of 20 ms (50 pps).
	  >
	  > We only handle MKI with index 1.
	  >
	  > We do not really bother with counting packets and reinviting at end of
	  > lifetime, so the min of 10 hours kind of takes care of most calls. If there
	  > are longer ones, we rely on the other side for re-invites.
	  >
	  > It's still not perfect, but I personally think this is an improvement. A
	  > configuration option for minimum lifetime accepted could be added.

	  When the patch was ported forward, I decided against adding a configuration
	  option as Olle's handling was more than sufficient for every case I've seen
	  come through the issue tracker or through interoperability testing. We can
	  revisit that decision if it proves to be false.

	  A few small other tweaks were made to the surrounding code to reduce
	  indentation and provide better type safety for the 'tag' parameter.

	* Increase WebSocket frame size and improve large read handling

	  Some WebSocket applications, like [chan_respoke][], require a larger
	  frame size than the default 8k; this patch bumps the default to 16k.
	  This patch also fixes some problems exacerbated by large frames.

	  The sanity counter was decremented on every fread attempt in
	  ws_safe_read(), regardless of whether data was read from the socket or
	  not. For large frames, this could result in loss of sanity prior to
	  reading the entire frame. (16k frame / 1448 bytes per segment = 12
	  segments).

	  This patch changes the sanity counter so that it only decrements when
	  fread() doesn't read any bytes. This more closely matches the original
	  intention of ws_safe_read(), given that the error message is
	  "Websocket seems unresponsive".

	  This patch also properly logs EOF conditions, so disconnects are no
	  longer confused with unresponsive connections.

	* channels/chan_sip: Fix crash when transmitting packet after thread shutdown

	  When the monitor thread is stopped, its pthread ID is set to a specific value
	  (AST_PTHREADT_STOP) so that later portions of the code can determine whether
	  or not it is safe to manipulate the thread. Unfortunately, __sip_reliable_xmit
	  failed to check for that value, checking instead only for AST_PTHREAD_STOP.
	  Passing the invalid yet very specific value to pthread_kill causes a crash.

	  This patch adds a check for AST_PTHREADT_STOP in __sip_reliable_xmit such that
	  it doesn't attempt to poke the thread if the thread has already been stopped.

	* ARI/PJSIP: Apply requesting channel's format cap to created channels

	  This patch addresses the following problems:
	  * ari/resource_channels: In ARI, we currently create a format capability
	    structure of SLIN and apply it to the new channel being created. This was
	    originally done when the PBX core was used to create the channel, as there
	    was a condition where a newly created channel could be created without any
	    formats. Unfortunately, now that the Dial API is being used, this has two
	    drawbacks:
	    (a) SLIN, while it will ensure audio will flows, can cause a lot of
	        needless transcodings to occur, particularly when a Local channel is
	        created to the dialplan. When no format capabilities are available, the
	        Dial API handles this better by handing all audio formats to the requsted
	        channels. As such, we defer to that API to provide the format
	        capabilities.
	    (b) If a channel (requester) is causing this channel to be created, we
	        currently don't use its format capabilities as we are passing in our own.
	        However, the Dial API will use the requester channel's formats if none
	        are passed into it, and the requester channel exists and has format
	        capabilities. This is the "best" scenario, as it is the most likely to
	        create a media path that minimizes transcoding.
	    Fixing this simply entails removing the providing of the format capabilities
	    structure to the Dial API.

	  * chan_pjsip: Rather than blindly picking the first format in the format
	    capability structure - which actually *can* be a video or text format - we
	    select an audio format, and only pick the first format if that fails. That
	    minimizes the weird scenario where we attempt to transcode between video/audio.

	  * res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Applied the joint capapbilites to the format structure.
	    Since ast_request already limits us down to one format capability once the
	    format capabilities are passed along, there's no reason to squelch it here.

	  * channel: Fixed a comment. The reason we have to minimize our requested
	    format capabilities down to a single format is due to Asterisk's inability
	    to convey the format to be used back "up" a channel chain. Consider the
	    following:

	      PJSIP/A => L;1 <=> L;2 => PJSIP/B
	      g,u,a     g,u,a    g,u,a      u

	    That is, we have PJSIP/A dialing a Local channel, where the Local;2 dials
	    PJSIP/B. PJSIP/A has native format capabilities g722,ulaw,alaw; the Local
	    channel has inherited those format capabilities down the line; PJSIP/B
	    supports only ulaw. According to these format capabilities, ulaw is
	    acceptable and should be selected across all the channels, and no
	    transcoding should occur. However, there is no way to convey this: when L;2
	    and PJSIP/B are put into a bridge, we will select ulaw, but that is not
	    conveyed to PJSIP/A and L;1. Thus, we end up with:

	      PJSIP/A <=> L;1 <=> L;2 <=> PJSIP/B
	        g          g   X   u        u

	    Which causes g722 to be written to PJSIP/B.

	    Even if we can convey the 'ulaw' choice back up the chain (which through
	    some severe hacking in Local channels was accomplished), such that the chain
	    looks like:

	      PJSIP/A <=> L;1 <=> L;2 <=> PJSIP/B
	        u          u       u         u

	    We have no way to tell PJSIP/A's *channel driver* to Answer in the SDP back
	    with only 'ulaw'. This results in all the channel structures being set up
	    correctly, but PJSIP/A *still* sending g722 and causing the chain to fall
	    apart.

	    There's a lot of difficulty just in setting this up, as there are numerous
	    race conditions in the act of bridging, and no clean mechanism to pass the
	    selected format backwards down an established channel chain. As such, the
	    best that can be done at this point in time is clarifying the comment.

	* bridge_softmix: G.729 codec license held

	  When more than one call using the same codec type enters into a softmix bridge
	  and no audio is present for a channel the bridge optimizes the out frame by
	  using the same one for all channels with the same codec type. Unfortunately,
	  when that number (channels with same codec type) dropped to <= 1 the codec
	  was not dereferenced. At least not until all parties left the bridge. Thus in
	  the case of G.729 the license was not released. This patch ensures that the
	  codec is dereferenced immediately when the optimization no longer applies.

	* apps/app_voicemail: Demote an ERROR message to a WARNING message

	  When using IMAP voicemail with FreePBX, you will often get ERROR messages
	  complaining about not being able to find a mailbox. This is due to how FreePBX
	  handles voicemail mailboxes. Unfortunately, app_voicemail has to consider this
	  a configuration error, as in any other system it would be indicative of
	  someone misconfiguring their system.

	  Regardless, a misconfiguration is a WARNING, and not an ERROR. This patch
	  demotes the message so that system administrators can hopefully reduce some
	  of the noise in their log files.

	  Note that in the original patch this was made into a NOTICE, but that's a
	  too forgiving.

	* apps/app_voicemail: Fix IMAP header compatibility issue with Microsoft Exchange

	  When interfacing with Microsoft Exchange, custom headers will be returned as
	  all lower case. Currently, the IMAP header code will fail to parse the returned
	  custom headers, as it will be performing a case sensitive comparison. This can
	  cause playback of messages to fail, as needed information - such as origtime -
	  will not be present.

	  This patch updates app_voicemail's header parsing code to perform a case
	  insensitive lookup for the requested custom headers. Since the headers are
	  specific to Asterisk, e.g., 'x-asterisk-vm-orig-time', and headers should be
	  unique in an IMAP message, this should cause no issues with other systems.

	* ISDN AOC: Fix crash from an AOC-E message that doesn't have a channel association.

	  Processing an AOC-E event that does not or no longer has a channel
	  association causes a crash.

	  The problem with posting AOC events to the channel topic is that AOC-E
	  events don't always have a channel association and posting the event to
	  the all channels topic is just wrong.  AOC-E events do however have their
	  own charging association method to refer to the agreement with the
	  charging entity.

	  * Changed the AOC events to post to the AMI manager topic instead of the
	  channel topics.  If a channel is associated with the event then channel
	  snapshot information is supplied with the AMI event.

	  * Eliminated RAII_VAR() usage in aoc_to_ami() and ast_aoc_manager_event().

	  This patch supercedes the patch on Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/4427/

	* res_pjsip_refer: Fix crash from a REFER and BYE collision.

	  Analyzing a one-off crash on a busy system showed that processing a REFER
	  request had a NULL session channel pointer.  The only way I can think of
	  that could cause this is if an outgoing BYE transaction overlapped the
	  incoming REFER transaction in a collision.  Asterisk sends a BYE while the
	  phone sends a REFER to complete an attended transfer.

	  * Made check the session channel pointer before processing an incoming
	  REFER request in res_pjsip_refer.

	  * Fixed similar crash potential for res_pjsip supplement incoming request
	  processing for res_pjsip_sdp_rtp INFO, res_pjsip_caller_id INVITE/UPDATE,
	  res_pjsip_messaging MESSAGE, and res_pjsip_send_to_voicemail REFER
	  messages.

	  * Made res_pjsip_messaging respond to a message body too large with a 413
	  instead of ignoring it.

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk: Fix crash in debug from RTCP reports without report block

	  When RTCP debugging was enabled, an RTCP report without a report block would

	* res_sorcery_config: Improve object lookup times.

	  The res_sorcery_config module currently uses a fixed bucket
	  size of 53. This means that depending on the number of objects
	  you either end up with excess buckets or a lot of collisions.
	  Due to the way that res_sorcery_config is implemented it's actually
	  possible to make the bucket size dynamic based on the number of
	  objects. This is due to the fact that each loading of the config file
	  produces a new container and does not modify the existing one.
	  This change uses the number of expected objects and finds a prime
	  number near it. In practice depending on the number of objects this
	  can speed up lookups anywhere from 2X to 15X. This change also removes
	  the lock from the container as it is not needed.

	* apps/app_mixmonitor: Move Test Event for MIXMONITOR_END to after it finishes

	  The Test Event for MIXMONITOR_END - which signals that a MixMonitor has

	  used this to trigger a condition to verify that the file was written, it
	  could result in a race condition where the file size would not be what the
	  test expected.

	  Luckily, no tests were using this (although they should have been). Since the
	  test event needed to be moved after the point where the MixMonitor autochan has
	  been destroyed, the test event no longer emits the channel name. Luckily,
	  nothing needs it.

	* res_pjsip_session: Fix double re-INVITE collision crash.

	  A multi-asterisk box setup with direct media enabled would occasionally
	  crash when two re-INVITE collisions on a call leg happen in a row.

	  The re-INVITE logic only had one timer struct to defer the re-INVITE.
	  When the second collision happens the timer struct is overwritten and put
	  into the timer heap again.  Resources for the first timer are leaked and
	  the heap has two positions occupied by the same timer struct.  Now the
	  heap ordering is potentially corrupted, the timer will fire twice, and any
	  resources allocated for the second timer will be released twice.

	  * The solution is to put the collided re-INVITE into the delayed requests
	  queue with all the other delayed requests and cherry pick the next request
	  that can come off the queue when an event happens.

	  * Changed to put delayed BYE requests at the head of the delayed queue.
	  There is no sense in processing delayed UPDATEs and re-INVITEs when a BYE
	  has been requested.

	  * Made the start of a BYE request flush the delayed requests queue to
	  prevent a delayed request from overlapping the BYE transaction.  I saw a
	  few cases where a delayed re-INVITE got started after the BYE transaction
	  started.

	  * Changed the delayed_request struct to use an enum instead of a string
	  for the request method.  Cherry picking the queue is easier with an enum
	  than string comparisons and the compiler can warn if a switch statement
	  does not cover all defined enum values.

	  * Improved the debug output to give more information.  It helps to know
	  which channel is involved with an endpoint.  Trunks can have many channels
	  associated with the endpoint at the same time.

	* ARI/PJSIP: Add the ability to redirect (transfer) a channel in a Stasis app

	  This patch adds a new feature to ARI to redirect a channel to another server,
	  and fixes a few bugs in PJSIP's handling of the Transfer dialplan
	  application/ARI redirect capability.

	  *New Feature*
	  A new operation has been added to the ARI channels resource, redirect. With
	  this, a channel in a Stasis application can be redirected to another endpoint
	  of the same underlying channel technology.

	  *Bug fixes*
	  In the process of writing this new feature, two bugs were fixed in the PJSIP
	  stack:
	  (1) The existing .transfer channel callback had the limitation that it could
	      only transfer channels to a SIP URI, i.e., you had to pass
	      'PJSIP/sip:foo@my_provider.com' to the dialplan application. While this is
	      still supported, it is somewhat unintuitive - particularly in a world full
	      of endpoints. As such, we now also support specifying the PJSIP endpoint to
	      transfer to.
	  (2) res_pjsip_multihomed was, unfortunately, trying to 'help' a 302 redirect by
	      updating its Contact header. Alas, that resulted in the forwarding
	      destination set by the dialplan application/ARI resource/whatever being
	      rewritten with very incorrect information. Hence, we now don't bother
	      updating an outgoing response if it is a 302. Since this took a looong time
	      to find, some additional debug statements have been added to those modules
	      that update the Contact headers.

	* res_pjsip: dtls_handler causes Asterisk to crash

	  There have been a couple of times where a crash occurred in the dtls_handler
	  section of the code for res_pjsip. Unfortunately, in working this issue the
	  problem was unable to be reproduced. After looking at the backtraces and
	  through the code the current best guess as to why this happened might be due
	  to a reentrance problem and the strtok function. So, the current fix is to
	  convert the strtok function into the reentrant version of the function,
	  strtok_r.

	* HTTP: Stop accepting requests on final system shutdown.

	  There are three CLI commands to stop and restart Asterisk each.

	  1) core stop/restart now - Hangup all calls and stop or restart Asterisk.
	  New channels are prevented while the shutdown request is pending.

	  2) core stop/restart gracefully - Stop or restart Asterisk when there are
	  no calls remaining in the system.  New channels are prevented while the
	  shutdown request is pending.

	  3) core stop/restart when convenient - Stop or restart Asterisk when there
	  are no calls in the system.  New calls are not prevented while the
	  shutdown request is pending.

	  ARI has made stopping/restarting Asterisk more problematic.  While a
	  shutdown request is pending it is desirable to continue to process ARI
	  HTTP requests for current calls.  To handle the current calls while a
	  shutdown request is pending, a new committed to shutdown phase is needed
	  so ARI applications can deal with the calls until the system is fully
	  committed to shutdown.

	  * Added a new shutdown committed phase so ARI applications can deal with
	  calls until the final committed to shutdown phase is reached.

	  * Made refuse new HTTP requests when the system has reached the final
	  system shutdown phase.  Starting anything while the system is actively
	  releasing resources and unloading modules is not a good thing.

	  * Split the bridging framework shutdown to not cleanup the global bridging
	  containers when shutting down in a hurry.  This is similar to how other
	  modules prevent crashes on rapid system shutdown.

	  * Moved ast_begin_shutdown(), ast_cancel_shutdown(), and
	  ast_shutting_down().  You should not have to include channel.h just to
	  access these system functions.

	* channels/chan_sip: Fix RealTime error during SIP unregistration with MariaDB

	  When a SIP device that has its registration stored in RealTime unregisters,
	  the entry for that device is updated with blank values, i.e., "", indicating
	  that it is no longer registered. Unfortunately, one of those values that is
	  'blanked' is the device's port. If the column type for the port is not a
	  string datatype (the recommended type is integer), an ODBC or database error
	  will be thrown. MariaDB does not coerce empty strings to a valid integer value.

	  This patch updates the query run from chan_sip such that it replaces the port
	  value with a value of '0', as opposed to a blank value. This is the value that
	  other database backends coerce the empty string ("") to already, and the
	  handling of reading a RealTime registration value from a backend already
	  anticipates receiving a port of '0' from the backends.

	* res_pjsip_config_wizard: Add ability to auto-create hints.

	  Looking at the Super Awesome Company sample reminded me that creating hints is 
	  just plain gruntwork.  So you can now have the pjsip conifg wizard auto-create 
	  them for you.

	  Specifying 'hint_exten' in the wizard will create 
	  'exten => <hint_exten>,hint/PJSIP/<wizard_id>'
	  in whatever is specified for 'hint_context'.

	  Specifying 'hint_application' in the wizard will create
	  'exten => <hint_exten>,1,<hint_application>'
	  in whatever is specified for 'hint_context'.

	  The default for 'hint_context' is the endpoint's context.
	  There's no default for 'hint_application'.  If not specified, no app is added.
	  There's no default for 'hint_exten'.  If not specified, neither the hint itself 
	  nor the application will be created.

	  Some may think this is the slippery slope to users.conf but hints are a basic 
	  necessity for phones unlike voicemail, manager, etc that users.conf creates.

	  When an SDP is created for an outgoing request/response, the ICE candidates

	* sorcery: Don't try to load object types which haven't been defined.

	  The act of defining wizards for an object type in sorcery.conf will
	  create a minimal object type. This can cause a problem when a module
	  has multiple sorcery instances (which all get the wizards from sorcery.conf
	  applied) but the sorcery instances do not all contain full information
	  about the object types. Upon loading errors will occur stating that
	  the objects can not be created. This is confusing and is actually
	  perfectly fine.

	  This change makes it so that only object types which have been fully
	  defined will be loaded.

	* app_agent_pool: Fix initial module load agent device state reporting.

	  When the app_agent_pool module initially loads there is a race condition
	  between the thread loading agents.conf and the device state internal
	  processing thread.  If the device state internal processing thread handles
	  the agent creation state updates before the thread that loaded agents.conf
	  registers the device state provider callback then the cached agent state
	  is "Invalid".  When a consumer module like app_queue asks for the agent state
	  it gets the cached "Invalid" state instead of the real state from the provider.

	  * Moved loading the agents.conf configuration to the last thing setup by
	  app_agent_pool in load_module().  Now the device state provider callback
	  is registered before the config is loaded so the agent creation state
	  updates are guaranteed to get the initial device state.

	  * Removed some now redundant config cleanup on error in load_config().

	  * Added lock protection when accessing the device state in
	  agent_pvt_devstate_get() and eliminated the RAII_VAR() usage.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_publish: eventually crashes when no response is ever received

	  When Asterisk attempts to send SIP outbound publish information and no response
	  is ever received (no 200 okay, 412, 423) the system eventually crashes. A
	  response is never received because the system Asterisk is attempting to send
	  publish information to is not available. The underlying pjsip framework attempts
	  to send publish information. After several attempts it calls back into the
	  Asterisk outbound publish code. At this point if the "client->queue" is empty
	  Asterisk attempts to schedule a refresh which utilizes "rdata" and since no
	  response was received the given "rdata" struture is NULL. Attempting to
	  dereference a NULL object of course results in a crash.

	  The fix here removes the dependency on rdata for schedule_publish_refresh.
	  Instead param->expiration is now passed to it as this is set to -1 if no
	  response is received. Also added a notification when no response is received.

	* stasis transfer: fix stasis bridge push race part two

	  When swapping a Local channel in place of one already
	  in a bridge (to complete a bridge attended transfer),
	  the channel that was swapped out can actually be hung
	  up before the stasis bridge push callback executes on
	  the independant transfer thread.  This results in the
	  stasis app loop dropping out and removing the control
	  that has the the app name which the local replacement
	  channel needs so it can re-enter stasis.

	  To avoid this race condition a new push_peek callback
	  has been added, and called from the ast_bridge_impart
	  thread before it launches the independant thread that
	  will complete the transfer.  Now the stasis push_peek
	  callback can copy the stasis app name before the swap
	  channel can hang up.

	* media formats: update res_format_attr_opus & silk

	  In r419044, we changed how formats were handled, but the return value
	  of the format_parse_sdp_fmtp functions in res_format_attr_opus and
	  res_format_attr_silk were not updated, causing calls to fail.  Ran
	  into this when getting codec_opus working with Asterisk 13.

	  Once the return value was corrected, we were crashing in opus_getjoint

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Fix reload race condition.

	  Performing a CLI "module reload" command when there are new pjsip.conf
	  registration objects defined frequently failed to load them correctly.

	  What happens is a race condition between res_pjsip pushing its reload into
	  an asynchronous task processor task and the thread that does the rest of
	  the reloads when it gets to reloading the res_pjsip_outbound_registration
	  module.  A similar race condition happens between a reload and the CLI/AMI
	  show registrations commands.  The reload updates the current_states
	  container and the CLI/AMI commands call get_registrations() which builds a
	  new current_states container.

	  * Made res_pjsip.c reload_module() use ast_sip_push_task_synchronous()
	  instead of ast_sip_push_task() to eliminate two threads processing config
	  reloads at the same time.

	  * Made get_registrations() not replace the global current_states container
	  so the CLI/AMI show registrations command cannot interfere with reloading.
	  You could never add/remove objects in the container without the
	  possibility of the container being replaced out from under you by
	  get_registrations().

	  * Added a registration loaded sorcery instance observer to purge any dead
	  registration objects since get_registrations() cannot do this job anymore.
	  The struct ast_sorcery_instance_observer callbacks must be used because
	  the callback happens inline with the load process.  The struct
	  ast_sorcery_observer callbacks are pushed to a different thread.

	  * Added some global current_states NULL pointer checks in case the
	  container disappears because of unload_module().

	  * Made sorcery's struct ast_sorcery_instance_observer.object_type_loaded
	  callbacks guaranteed to be called before any struct
	  ast_sorcery_observer.loaded callbacks will be called.

	  * Moved the check for non-reloadable objects to before the sorcery
	  instance loading callbacks happen to short circuit unnecessary work.
	  Previously with non-reloadable objects, the sorcery instance
	  loading/loaded callbacks would always happen, the individual wizard
	  loading/loaded would be prevented, and the non-reloadable type logging
	  message would be logged for each associated wizard.

	* tcptls: Bad file descriptor error when reloading chan_sip

	  While running through some scenarios using chan_sip and tcp a problem would
	  occur that resulted in a flood of bad file descriptor messages on the cli:

	  tcptls.c:712 ast_tcptls_server_root: Accept failed: Bad file descriptor

	  The message is received because the underlying socket has been closed, so is
	  valid. This is probably happening because unloading of chan_sip is not atomic.
	  That however is outside the scope of this patch. This patch simply stops the
	  logging of multiple occurrences of that message.

	* chan_sip: stale nonce causes failure

	  When refreshing (with a small expiration) a registration that was sent to
	  chan_sip the nonce would be considered stale and reject the registration.
	  What was happening was that the initial registration's "dialog" still existed
	  in the dialogs container and upon refresh the dialog match algorithm would
	  choose that as the "dialog" instead of the newly created one. This occurred
	  because the algorithm did not check to see if the from tag matched if
	  authentication info was available after the 401. So, it ended up assuming
	  the original "dialog" was a match and stopped the search. The old "dialog"
	  of course had an old nonce, thus the stale nonce message.

	  This fix attempts to leave the original functionality alone except in the case
	  of a REGISTER. If a REGISTER is received if searches for an existing "dialog"
	  matching only on the callid. If the expires value is low enough it will reuse
	  dialog that is there, otherwise it will create a new one.

	* res_pjsip: make it unloadable (take 2)

	  Due to the original patch causing memory corruptions it was removed until the
	  problem could be resolved. This patch is the original patch plus some added
	  locking around stasis router subcription that was needed to avoid the memory
	  corruption.

	  Description of the original problem and patch (still applicable):

	  The res_pjsip module was previously unloadable. With this patch it can now
	  be unloaded.

	  This patch is based off the original patch on the issue (listed below) by Corey
	  Farrell with a few modifications. Namely, removed a few changes not required to
	  make the module unloadable and also fixed a bug that would cause asterisk to
	  crash on unloading.

	  This patch is the first step (should hopefully be followed by another/others at
	  some point) in allowing res_pjsip and the modules that depend on it to be
	  unloadable. At this time, res_pjsip and some of the modules that depend on
	  res_pjsip cannot be unloaded without causing problems of some sort.

	  The goal of this patch is to get res_pjsip and only res_pjsip to be able to
	  unload successfully and/or shutdown without incident (crashes, leaks, etc...).
	  Other dependent modules may still cause problems on unload.

	  Basically made sure, with the patch applied, that res_pjsip (with no other
	  dependent modules loaded) could be succesfully unloaded and Asterisk could
	  shutdown without any leaks or crashes that pertained directly to res_pjsip.

	* app_confbridge: Repeatedly starting and stopping recording ref leaks the recording channel.

	  Starting and stopping conference recording more than once causes the
	  recording channels to be leaked.  For v13 the channels also show up in the
	  CLI "core show channels" output.

	  * Reworked and simplified the recording channel code to use
	  ast_bridge_impart() instead of managing the recording thread in the
	  ConfBridge code.  The recording channel's ref handling easily falls into
	  place and other off nominal code paths get handled better as a result.

	* bridge / res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Fix issues with media not being reinvited during direct media.

	  This change fixes two issues:

	  1. During a swap operation bridging added the new channel before having the swap channel
	  leave. This was not handled in bridge_native_rtp and could result in a channel not getting
	  reinvited back to Asterisk. After this change the swap channel will leave first and the
	  new channel will then join.

	  2. If a re-invite was received after a session had been established any upstream elements
	  (such as bridge_native_rtp) were not notified that they may want to re-evaluate things.
	  After this change an UPDATE_RTP_PEER control frame is queued when this situation occurs
	  and upstream can react.

	* ARI: Improve wiki documentation

	  This patch improves the documentation of ARI on the wiki. Specifically, it
	  addresses the following:
	  * Allowed values and allowed ranges weren't documented. This was particularly
	    frustrating, as Asterisk would reject query parameters with disallowed values
	    - but we didn't tell anyone what the allowed values were.
	  * The /play/id operation on /channels and /bridges failed to document all of
	    the added media resource types.
	  * Documentation for creating a channel into a Stasis application failed to
	    note when it occurred, and that creating a channel into Stasis conflicts with
	    creating a channel into the dialplan.
	  * Some other minor tweaks in the mustache templates, including italicizing the
	    parameter type, putting the default value on its own sub-bullet, and some
	    other nicities.

	* app_confbridge: Restore user's menu name to CLI output of 'confbridge list'

	  When issuing a 'confbridge list XXXX' CLI command, the resulting output no
	  longer displays the menu associated with a ConfBridge participant.

	  The issue was caused by ASTERISK-22760. When that patch was done, it removed
	  the copying of the menu name associated with the user from the actual user
	  profile.

	  This patch fixes the issue by copying the menu name over to the user profile
	  when the menu hooks are applied to the user. Since that function now does a
	  little bit more than just apply the hooks, the name of the function has been
	  changed to cover the copying of the menu name over as well.

	  In addition, there is a disparity between the menu name length as it is stored
	  on the conf_menu structure and the confbridge_user structure; this patch makes
	  the lengths match so that a strcpy can be used.

	* dynamic realtime: Updates fail to work due to update fields being passed over

	  When a crash was fixed due to usage of the REALTIME function in r423003, a
	  regression was introduced into ast_update2_realtime where the update fields
	  passed to the function would be skipped and the lookup field processed twice.

	  The use of this function is a bit interesting: A variable argument list is
	  used with two sentinel values - the first marks the end of the lookup
	  fields/values; the second marks the end of the update fields/values.
	  Unfortunately, ast_update2_realtime parses over the lookup fields twice, as
	  opposed to parsing over the update fields. This causes the lookups to succeed,
	  but the updates itself to have no effect.

	  Note that the most common instance of this problem occurred in app_voicemail
	  during the updating of a mailbox password.

	  Thanks to the issue reporter, Paddy Grice, for pointing out the problem.

	* stasis transfer: fix a race condition on stasis bridge push

	  After a bridge transfer completes where a local replacement
	  channel is used, a stasis transfer message with the details
	  of the transfer is sent.  This is processed by stasis which
	  then sets the stasis app name and replaced channel snapshot
	  on the replacement channel.

	  However, since a separate thread was already started to run
	  stasis on the new replacement channel, a race was on to see
	  if the message processing would be completed before the app
	  name was needed, otherwise the channel would be hung up.

	  This change moves the calls used to set the stasis app name

	* apps/app_voicemail: Trigger MWI notification with MixMonitor m() option

	  The MixMonitor m() option allows a recording to be pushed to a specific
	  voicemail mailbox. If the message is delivered to the mailbox's INBOX, however,
	  no MWI notification is currently raised.

	  This patch corrects the issue by properly calling notify_new_state from the

	  message was placed in the mailbox's INBOX.

	* channels/chan_sip: Fix registration leak during reload

	  When the SIP registrations were migrated to using ao2 in what was then trunk,
	  the explicit destruction of the registrations on module reload was removed and
	  not replaced with an ao2 equivalent. Debugging done by Stefan Engström, the
	  issue reporter, on ASTERISK-24673 confirmed that the reference in the
	  registry_list container was being leaked.

	  Since the purpose of cleanup_all_regs is to prep a registration for
	  destruction, this function now calls an ao2_callback function callback with the
	  OBJ_MULTIPLE | OBJ_NODATA | OBJ_UNLINK flags used to remove the registrations.
	  This cleans up each registration, and also removes it from the registration
	  container registry_list.

	* apps/app_dial: Don't publish DialEnd twice on unexpected GoSub/Macro values

	  The Dial application has some interesting options with the mid-call Macro (M)
	  and GoSub (U) options. If the MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT returns specific
	  values, the Dial application will take some action upon the channels involved
	  in the dial operation (such as hanging up a particular party, etc.) The Dial
	  application ensures that a Stasis message is published in the event that
	  MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT returns a value that kills the dial operation, so
	  that there is a corresponding DialEnd event published in AMI/ARI for the
	  DialBegin event that preceeded it.

	  A bug exists where that same DialEnd event will be published on Stasis even if
	  the value returned in MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT is not one that the Dial
	  application cares about. This causes two DialEnd events to be published - one
	  with the MACRO_RESULT/GOSUB_RESULT and another with "ANSWERED" - which is all
	  sorts of wrong.

	  This patch fixes the bug by ensuring that we only publish a DialEnd message to
	  Stasis if the Dial application's mid-call Macro/GoSub returns something that
	  Dial cares about.

	  Prior to this changeset, posting to the: /ari/bridges/{bridgeId} endpoint without specifying a value for the [name] query parameter, would crash Asterisk if the bridge you are attempting to create (or update) had the same ID as an existing bridge. The internal mechanism of the POST operation interpreted a null value for name, thus resulting in an error condition that crashed Asterisk.

	* CHANNEL(peer), chan_iax2, res_fax, SNMP agent: Fix deadlock from reaching across a bridge.

	  Calling ast_channel_bridge_peer() cannot be done while holding any channel
	  locks.  The reported issue hit the deadlock in chan_iax2, but an audit of
	  the ast_channel_bridge_peer() calls found three more locations where the

	  had to rework the logic to not hold the channel lock.

	  * Made chan_iax2 no longer call ast_channel_bridge_peer().  It was done
	  for legacy reasons that no longer apply.

	* app_voicemail: Temp message left after review/hangup with ODBC/IMAP backend

	  When using ODBC or IMAP storage, temporary files created on the file system
	  must be disposed of using the DISPOSE macro. The DELETE macro will map to a
	  deletion function for the backend storage, but does not clean up any local
	  files created as a result of the operation.

	  When using voicemail with the operator and review options enabled, pressing
	  0 to enter the menu, followed by 1 to save the message, followed by any
	  other DTMF press to delete the message, will result in the temporary file
	  lingering on the file system.

	  This patch properly calls DISPOSE after the DELETE. This causes the local
	  file to be disposed of.

	* res_pjsip / res_pjsip_multihomed: Use the correct transport and addressing information on UAS sessions.

	  The first thing this patch fixes is UAS dialogs. Previously if a transport was
	  configured on an endpoint and an inbound session was created there was no guarantee
	  that requests sent on the dialog would use the correct transport and address
	  information. This has now been fixed so an explicitly configured transport
	  is taken into account.

	  The second thing this patch fixes is res_pjsip_multihomed. The res_pjsip_multihomed
	  module attempts to determine what transport a message should go out on and what
	  addressing information should go into the message itself. In a scenario where
	  multiple transports exist bound to the same IP address but a different port the
	  code would incorrectly alter the transport and change the message to the wrong
	  transport. This change makes the res_pjsip_multihomed module smarter so it will
	  only change the transport and address information in the message when it is
	  possible and makes sense.

	* configure: If cross-compiling, assume we have working semaphores

	  The Asterisk 13 configure.ac checks for HAS_WORKING_SEMAPHORE but does not have
	  an option for cross-compiling so it fails with an exit. Since we're cross-
	  compiling, we can't exactly go looking for the header. The semaphore.h header
	  is relatively common:
	  * It's part of the POSIX standard
	  * It's part of GNU C Library
	  As such, we assume that it will be present when cross-compiling.

	  As such, this patch defaults "HAS_WORKING_SEMAPHORE" to "1" if cross-compiling
	  is detected.

	  If you're cross-compiling to a platform that doesn't support this, then make
	  sure you re-define this to 0.

	* res_pjsip: make it unloadable

	  The res_pjsip module was previously unloadable. With this patch it can now
	  be unloaded.

	  This patch is based off the original patch on the issue (listed below) by Corey
	  Farrell with a few modifications. Namely, removed a few changes not required to
	  make the module unloadable and also fixed a bug that would cause asterisk to
	  crash on unloading.

	  This patch is the first step (should hopefully be followed by another/others at
	  some point) in allowing res_pjsip and the modules that depend on it to be
	  unloadable. At this time, res_pjsip and some of the modules that depend on
	  res_pjsip cannot be unloaded without causing problems of some sort.

	  The goal of this patch is to get res_pjsip and only res_pjsip to be able to
	  unload successfully and/or shutdown without incident (crashes, leaks, etc...).
	  Other dependent modules may still cause problems on unload.

	  Basically made sure, with the patch applied, that res_pjsip (with no other
	  dependent modules loaded) could be succesfully unloaded and Asterisk could
	  shutdown without any leaks or crashes that pertained directly to res_pjsip.

	  The code was missing the case for explicitly destroying an outbound publication

	  Cflags: -I/usr/include/libxml2 -g3

	* app_macro: Don't restore the calling location on a channel redirect.

	  v11: If a channel redirect to a macro exten of a macro that is active
	  happens, the redirect location doesn't get executed.  Instead the original
	  macro location is restored and gets reexecuted.

	  v13: An additional effect happens if a parked call times out to an
	  extension in the macro that parked the call then the macro is reexecuted
	  instead of the expected park return location.

	  * Made not restore the macro calling location on an
	  AST_SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO.

	  * Increased the locked channel range when setting up the macro execution
	  environment to cover things that should be done while the channel is
	  locked.

	* chan_pjsip: Add configure check for 'pjsip_get_dest_info' function.

	  The 'pjsip_get_dest_info' function is used to determine if the signaling transport
	  of the dialog is secure or not. This function was added in PJSIP 2.3 and does not
	  exist in earlier versions.

	  This configure check allows Asterisk to build and run with older versions at the

	  this argument will require upgrading to PJSIP 2.3.

	* app_bridge: return to the next dialplan priority

	  ended.   Although it stores the current dialplan

	  of going to the next priority.   By swapping the

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Fix persistent subscriptions not surviving graceful shutdown

	  If you do a 'core (shutdown|restart) graceful' persistent subscriptions won't 
	  survive.  If you do a 'core (shutdown|restart) now' or asterisk terminates for 
	  some reason, they do.  Here's why...

	  When asterisk shuts down gracefully, it sends a 'NOTIFY/terminated' to 
	  subscribers for each subscription.  This not only tells the subscribers that the 
	  dialog/state machine is done, it also frees the last reference to the 
	  subscription tree which causes the persistent subscription to get deleted from 
	  astdb.  When asterisk restarts, nothing's left.  Just preventing the delete from 
	  astdb doesn't work because we already told the subscriber to terminate the 
	  dialog so we can't restart it even if it was still in astdb.  Everything works 
	  OK if asterisk terminates unexpectedly because we never send the 'terminated' 
	  message so on restart, the subscription is still in astdb and the subscriber is 
	  none the wiser.

	  This patch suppresses the sending of 'NOTIFY/terminated' on shutdown for 
	  persistent connections.

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Fix several reload issues

	  There are 2 issues with reloading registrations...

	  1.  The 'can_reuse_registration' test wasn't considering the intervals or 
	  expiration in its determination of whether a registration changed or not so if 
	  you changed any of the intervals or the expiration and reloaded, the object 
	  would get reloaded but the actual timers wouldn't change.  
	  can_reuse_registration now does a sorcery diff on the old and new objects 
	  instead of discretely testing certain fields.  Now if you change expiration for 
	  instance, and reload, the timer is updated and re-registration will occur on the 
	  new value.

	  2.  If you mung up your password on an outbound registration you get a permanent 
	  failure.  If you fix the password (on the outbound_auth object) and reload, 
	  nothing tells outbound_registration to try again because the registration itself 
	  didn't change.  This patch adds an observer on the "auth" object type and if any 
	  auth changes, existing registration states are searched and those in a 
	  REJECTED_PERMANENT state are retried.

	  POST /channels
	  POST /channels/{id}/continue

	  Accept a new parameter, label, that can be used to continue to or originate

	* func_config: Add ability to retrieve specific occurrence of a variable

	  I guess nobody uses templates with AST_CONFIG because today if you have a

	  context.  This is because AST_CONFIG only gets the first occurrence which is

	* config: Add option to NOT preserve effective context when changing a template

	  Let's say you have a template T with variable VAR1 = ON and you have a
	  context C(T) that doesn't specify VAR1.  If you read C, the effective value
	  of VAR1 is ON.  Now you change T VAR1 to OFF and call
	  ast_config_text_file_save.  The current behavior is that the file gets
	  re-written with T/VAR1=OFF but C/VAR1=ON is added.  Personally, I think this
	  is a bug. It's preserving the effective state of C even though I didn't
	  specify C/VAR1 in th first place.  I believe the behavior should be that if
	  I didn't specify C/VAR1 originally, then the effective value of C/VAR1 should
	  continue to follow the inherited state.  Now, if I DID explicitly specify
	  C/VAR1, the it should be preserved even if the template changes.

	  Even though I think the existing behavior is a bug, it's been that way forever
	  so I'm not changing it.  Instead, I've created ast_config_text_file_save2()
	  that takes a bitmask of flags, one of which is to preserve the effective context
	  (the current behavior).  The original ast_config_text_file_save calls *2 with
	  the preserve flag.  If you want the new behavior, call *2 directly without a
	  flag.

	  I've also updated Manager UpdateConfig with a new parameter
	  'PreserveEffectiveContext' whose default is 'yes'.  If you want the new behavior
	  with UpdateConfig, set 'PreserveEffectiveContext: no'.

	  contrib/ast-db-manage: Correct down_revision path for user_eq_phone

	  When the user_eq_phone patch was backported to 13, it referenced the downward
	  revision that the PJSIP optimistic encryption option also references. This
	  creates a multi-path upgrade Exception when generating the SQL files.

	  This patch corrects this in the 13 branch. Note that trunk, which already
	  contained both of these features, is unaffected by this problem.

	* res_pjsip_mwi: Change warning to notice

	  When res_pjsip loads and an endpoint auto-subscribes a mailbox for mwi,
	  if a contact hasn't registered yet, res_pjsip_mwi spits out a warning.
	  This is a perfectly normal situation though and doesn't require something
	  as serious as a warning.  It's also self correcting. The device will start
	  getting mwi as soon as it registers.

	  This patch changes the warning to a notice.

	* outbound_registration: Add 'pjsip send register' and update 'send unregister'

	  The current behavior of 'pjsip send unregister' is to send the unregister
	  (REGISTER with 0 exp) but let the next scheduled register proceed normally.
	  I don't think that's a good idea.  If you unregister, it should stay
	  unregistered until you decide to start registrations again.  So this patch
	  just adds a cancel_registration call to the current unregister_task to
	  cancel the timer.

	  Of course, now you need  a way to start registration again so I've added
	  a 'pjsip send register' command that unregisters and cancels any existing
	  registration (the same as send unregister), then sends an immediate
	  registration and starts the timer back up again.

	  Both changes also ripple to AMI.  There's a new PJSIPRegister command.

	  There's no harm in calling either command repeatedly.  They don't care
	  about the actual state.

	* bridge: avoid leaking channel during blond transfer pt2

	  A blond transfer to a failed destination, when followed
	  by a recall attempt, lead to a leak of the reference to
	  the destination channel.  In addition to correcting the
	  regression on the previous attempt (r429826) this fixes
	  the leak and two additional reference leaks on failures
	  of bridge_import.

	* DTMF atxfer: Setup recall channels as if the transferee initiated the call.

	  After the initial DTMF atxfer call attempt to the transfer target fails to

	  the recall callback to the transferrer does not have callid, channel

	  but it is less visible.  The recall callback to the transfer target does

	* chan_sip: Send CANCEL via original INVITE destination even after UPDATE request

	  Given the following scenario:
	  * Three SIP phones (A, B, C), all communicating via a proxy with Asterisk
	  * A call is established between A and B. B performs a SIP attended transfer of
	    A to C. B sets the call on hold (A is hearing MOH) and dials the extension of
	    C. While phone C is ringing, B transfers the call (that is, what we typically
	    call a 'blond transfer').
	  * When the transfer completes, A hears the ringing of phone C, while B is idle.

	  In the SIP messaging for the above scenario, a REFER request is sent to
	  transfer the call. When "sendrpid=yes" is set in sip.conf, Asterisk may send an
	  UPDATE request to phone C to update party information. This update is sent
	  directly to phone C, not through the intervening proxy. This has the unfortunate
	  side effect of providing route information, which is then set on the sip_pvt
	  structure for C. If someone (e.g. B) is trying to get the call back (through a
	  directed pickup), Asterisk will send a CANCEL request to C. However, since we
	  have now updated the route set, the CANCEL request will be sent directly to C
	  and not through the proxy. The phone ignores this CANCEL according to RFC3261
	  (Section 9.1).

	  This patch updates reqprep such that the route is not updated if an UPDATE
	  request is being sent while the INVITE state is INV_PROCEEDING or
	  INV_EARLY_MEDIA. This ensures that a subsequent CANCEL request is still sent
	  to the correct location.

	* bridge: avoid leaking channel during blond transfer

	  After a blond transfer (start attended and hang up)
	  to a destination that also hangs up without answer,
	  the Local;1 channel was leaked and would show up on
	  core show channels.  This was happening because the
	  attended state blond_nonfinal_enter() resetting the
	  props->transfer_target to null while releasing it's
	  own reference, which would later prevent props from
	  releasing another reference during destruction. The
	  change made here is simply to not assign the target
	  to NULL.

	  property, AST_RTP_PROPERTY_DTMF, for the appropriate DTMF mode(s) for pjsip.
	  It was not being set before, meaning all DTMF modes for pjsip were being treated

	  shouldn't have been.

	* Prevent potential infinite outbound authentication loops in registration.

	  Prior to this patch, Asterisk would always respond to 401 responses to
	  registration attempts by trying to provide a registration with authentication
	  credentials. Even if subsequent attempts were rejected with 401 responses,
	  Asterisk would continue this behavior. If authentication credentials were
	  incorrect, this could continue forever.

	  With this patch, we keep track of whether we have attempted authentication
	  on an outbound registration attempt. If we already have, we don not try
	  again until the next attempt. This prevents the infinite loop scenario.

	  The AST_FLAG_BRIDGE_DUAL_REDIRECT_WAIT flag was created to prevent bridges from
	  prematurely acting on orphaned channels in bridges. The problem with the AMI
	  redirect action was that it was setting this flag on channels based on the presence
	  of a PBX, not whether the channel was in a bridge. Whether a channel has a PBX
	  is irrelevant, so the condition has been altered to check if the channel is in a

	* Fix printf problems with high ascii characters after r413586 (1.8).

	  In r413586 (1.8) various casts were added to silence gcc 4.10 warnings.
	  Those fixes included things like:

	      -out += sprintf(out, "%%%02X", (unsigned char) *ptr);
	      +out += sprintf(out, "%%%02X", (unsigned) *ptr);

	  That works for low ascii characters, but for the high range that yields
	  e.g. FFFFFFC3 when C3 is expected.

	  This changeset:
	  - fixes those casts to use the 'hh' unsigned char modifier instead
	  - consistently uses %02x instead of %2.2x (or other non-standard usage)
	  - adds a few 'h' modifiers in various places
	  - fixes a 'replcaes' typo
	  - dev/urandon typo (in 13+ patch)

	* DEBUG_THREADS: Fix regression and lock tracking initialization problems.

	  This patch started with David Lee's patch at
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2826/ and includes a regression fix
	  introduced by the ASTERISK-22455 patch.

	  The initialization of a mutex's lock tracking structure was not protected
	  in a critical section.  This is fine for any mutex that is explicitly
	  initialized, but a static mutex may have its lock tracking double
	  initialized if multiple threads attempt the first lock simultaneously.

	  * Added a global mutex to properly serialize initialization of the lock
	  tracking structure.  The painful global lock can be mitigated by adding a
	  double checked lock flag as discussed on the original review request.

	  * Defer lock tracking initialization until first use.

	  * Don't be "helpful" and initialize an uninitialized lock when
	  DEBUG_THREADS is enabled.  Debug code is not supposed to fix or change
	  normal code behavior.  We don't need a lock initialization race that would
	  force a re-setup of lock tracking.  Lock tracking already handles
	  initialization on first use.

	  * Properly handle allocation failures of the lock tracking structure.

	  * No need to initialize tracking data in __ast_pthread_mutex_destroy()
	  just to turn around and destroy it.


	  The regression introduced by ASTERISK-22455 is the result of manipulating
	  a pthread_mutex_t struct outside of the pthread library code.  The
	  pthread_mutex_t struct seems to have a global linked list pointer member
	  that can get changed by other threads.  Therefore, saving and restoring
	  the contents of a pthread_mutex_t struct is a bad thing.

	  Thanks to Thomas Airmont for finding this obscure regression.

	  * Don't overwrite the struct ast_lock_track.reentr_mutex member to restore
	  tracking data in __ast_cond_wait() and __ast_cond_timedwait().  The
	  pthread_mutex_t struct must be treated as a read-only opaque variable.


	  Miscellaneous other items fixed by this patch:

	  * Match ast_suspend_lock_info() with ast_restore_lock_info() in
	  __ast_cond_timedwait().

	  * Made some uninitialized lock sanity checks return EINVAL and try a
	  DO_THREAD_CRASH.

	  * Fix bad canlog initialization expressions.

	  When shutting down Asterisk the codecs are cleaned up. As a result anything

	  This code did not take this situation into account.

	  This change fixes this by getting the codec directly from the format and

	  that the codec will exist and will be valid.

	* chan_pjsip: Race between channel answer and bridge setup when using direct media

	  When direct media is enabled and a pjsip channel is answered a race would occur
	  between the handling of the answer and bridge setup. Sometimes the media
	  negotiation would take place after the native bridge was setup. This resulted

	  as the remote media address when sending a reinvite.  This patch makes the

	  This allows use of the 'inactive' stream direction identifier to be
	  used for hold where 'sendonly' is normally used. Some Seimens phones
	  use 'inactive' and this change allows music on hold to operate

	* res_pjsip_session: Delay sending BYE if a re-INVITE transaction is in progress.

	  Given the scenario where a PJSIP channel is in a native RTP bridge with direct
	  media and the channel is then hung up the code will currently re-INVITE the channel
	  back to Asterisk and send a BYE at the same time. Many SIP implementations dislike
	  this greatly.

	  This change makes it so that if a re-INVITE transaction is in progress the BYE
	  is queued to occur after the completion of the transaction (be it through normal
	  means or a timeout).

	* res_pjsip_session: Fix issue where a declined media stream in a re-INVITE would fail SDP negotiation.

	  In the past the SDP negotiation within res_pjsip_session was made more tolerant of
	  certain situations. The only case where SDP negotiation will fail is when a major
	  error occurs during negotiation. Receiving an already declined media stream is
	  not considered a major error.

	  When producing the local SDP the logic took this into account so on the initial INVITE
	  the declined media stream did not cause an SDP negotiation failure. Unfortunately
	  the logic for handling media streams with a handler did not mirror this logic and
	  considered an already declined media stream an error and thus failed the SDP
	  negotiation.

	  This change makes the logic between both situations match so only under major
	  errors will the SDP negotiation fail.

	* res_http_websocket: Fix crash due to double freeing memory when receiving a payload length of zero.

	  Frames with a payload length of 0 were incorrectly handled in res_http_websocket.
	  Provided a frame with a payload had been received prior it was possible for a double
	  free to occur. The realloc operation would succeed (thus freeing the payload) but be
	  treated as an error. When the session was then torn down the payload would be
	  freed again causing a crash. The read function now takes this into account.

	  This change also fixes assumptions made by users of res_http_websocket. There is no
	  guarantee that a frame received from it will be NULL terminated.

	* Direct Media calls within private network sometimes get one way audio

	  When endpoints with direct_media enabled, behind a firewall (Asterisk on a
	  separate network) and were bridged sometimes Asterisk would send the ip
	  address of the firewall in the sdp to one of the phones in the reinvite
	  resulting in one way audio. When sending the reinvite Asterisk will retrieve
	  the media address from the associated rtp instance, but if frames were being
	  read this can be overwritten with another address (in this case the
	  firewall's).  This patch ensures that Asterisk uses the original device
	  address when using direct media.

	* Fix a crash that would occur when receiving a 491 response to a reinvite.

	  The reviewboard description does a fine job of summarizing this, so here it is:

	  A reporter discovered that Asterisk would crash when attempting to retransmit
	  a reinvite that had previously received a 491 response. The crash occurred
	  because a pjsip_tx_data structure was being saved for reuse, but its reference
	  count was not being increased. The result was that the pjsip_tx_data was being
	  freed before we were actually done with it. When we attempted to re-use the
	  structure when re-sending the reinvite, Asterisk would crash.

	  The fix implemented here is not to try holding onto the pjsip_tx_data at all.
	  Instead, when we reschedule sending the reinvite, we create a brand new
	  pjsip_tx_data and send that instead. Because of this change, there is no need
	  for an ast_sip_session_delayed_request structure to have a pjsip_tx_data on
	  it any more. So any code referencing its use has been removed.

	  When this initial fix was introduced, I encountered a second crash when
	  processing a subsequent 200 OK on a rescheduled reinvite. The reason was
	  that when rescheduling the reinvite, we gave the wrong location for a
	  response callback. This has been fixed in this patch as well.

	* main/test: Fix race condition between AMI topic and Test Suite topic

	  This patch fixes a race condition between the raising of test AMI events (which
	  drive many tests in the Asterisk Test Suite) and other AMI events. Prior to
	  this patch, the Stasis messages published to the test topic were not forwarded
	  to the AMI topic. Instead, the code in manager had a dedicated handler for test
	  messages that was independent of the topics forwarded to the AMI topic. This
	  results in no synchronization between the test messages and the rest of the
	  Stasis messages published out over AMI. In some test with very tight timing
	  constraints, this can result in out of order messages and spurious test

	* tests/test_cel: Fix CEL unit test failures caused by attended transfer changes

	  When the publication of attended transfer messages were pushed to another
	  thread, some subtle race conditions were introduced with the CEL unit tests.
	  This patch fixes one of them, and pushes the other to ASTERISK-22367, which
	  already exists to fix another bouncy CEL unit test.

	  In particular, this patch fixes the test_cel_attended_transfer_bridges_link
	  test, and defers the test_cel_attended_transfer_bridges_swap test to the
	  aforementioned JIRA issue.

	* apps/app_voicemail: Fix crash with IMAP when streams are opened simultaneously

	  The UW IMAP library is instrinsically not thread-safe, and relies upon higher
	  level applications to guarantee thread safety. For the most part, this is
	  provided by the vms object, which provides locking for individual streams.
	  Unfortunately, this is not sufficient for calls to mail_open which create the
	  IMAP stream. mail_open can, on some systems, call into a UW IMAP specific
	  function for determining the address of a system based on a hostname,
	  ip_nametoaddr.

	  In the ip6_unix implementation of this function, static variables are used
	  to hold parsing buffers. This can cause a crash if multiple threads attempt
	  to convert a hostname to an address at the same time. Locking on a single
	  mail stream is not sufficient to prevent simultaneous access to these static
	  variables.

	  In the IMAP library, this function can be called from the mail_open and
	  imap_status functions. As the imap_status function is not used by
	  app_voicemail, locking on access to mail_open is sufficient to prevent
	  any mangling of the buffers.

	* pbx/pbx_loopback: Speed up switches by avoiding unneeded lookups

	  This patch makes a small rearrangement to only do dialplan lookups during
	  loopback switches if the pattern matches. Prior to this patch, the dialplan
	  lookups were always performed, even when the result would be discarded.
	  Dialplan lookups can be very costly if remote switches - like DUNDi - are
	  present. In those cases extension matching is sped up considerably, making
	  the issue of lost digits more manageable.

	  As collateral damage, 6 trailing spaces were killed.

	* res_pjsip_refer: Fix issue where native bridge may not occur upon completion of a transfer.

	  There are two methods within res_pjsip_refer for keeping track of the state of a transfer.
	  The first is a framehook which looks at frames passing by to determine the state. The second
	  subscribes to know when the channel joins a bridge. In the case when the channel joins the
	  bridge the framehook is *NOT* removed and this prevents the native RTP bridging technology
	  from getting used.

	  This change gets the channel and if it still exists remove the framehook.

	* main/stasis: Allow subscriptions to use a threadpool for message delivery

	  Prior to this patch, all Stasis subscriptions would receive a dedicated
	  thread for servicing published messages. In contrast, prior to r400178
	  (see review https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2881/), the subscriptions
	  shared a thread pool. It was discovered during some initial work on Stasis
	  that, for a low subscription count with high message throughput, the
	  threadpool was not as performant as simply having a dedicated thread per
	  subscriber.

	  For situations where a subscriber receives a substantial number of messages
	  and is always present, the model of having a dedicated thread per subscriber
	  makes sense. While we still have plenty of subscriptions that would follow
	  this model, e.g., AMI, CDRs, CEL, etc., there are plenty that also fall into
	  the following two categories:
	  * Large number of subscriptions, specifically those tied to endpoints/peers.
	  * Low number of messages. Some subscriptions exist specifically to coordinate
	    a single message - the subscription is created, a message is published, the
	    delivery is synchronized, and the subscription is destroyed.
	  In both of the latter two cases, creating a dedicated thread is wasteful (and
	  in the case of a large number of peers/endpoints, harmful). In those cases,
	  having shared delivery threads is far more performant.

	  This patch adds the ability of a subscriber to Stasis to choose whether or not
	  their messages are dispatched on a dedicated thread or on a threadpool. The
	  threadpool is configurable through stasis.conf.

	  * Modifies ast_sorcery_fields_register to pre-compile the name regex.
	  * Modifies ast_sorcery_is_object_field_registered to test the regex if it
	    exists instead of doing an exact strcmp.

	* AST-2014-017 - app_confbridge: permission escalation/ class authorization.

	  Confbridge dialplan function permission escalation via AMI and inappropriate
	  class authorization on the ConfbridgeStartRecord action. The CONFBRIDGE dialplan
	  function when executed from an external protocol (for instance AMI), could
	  result in a privilege escalation. Also, the AMI action “ConfbridgeStartRecord”
	  could also be used to execute arbitrary system commands without first checking
	  for system access. The AMI “ConfbridgeStopRecord” has also been updated to
	  only run under a system authorization.

	  Asterisk now inhibits the CONFBRIDGE function from being executed from an
	  external interface if the live_dangerously option is set to no.  Also, the
	  “ConfbridgeStartRecord” AMI action is now only allowed to execute under a
	  user with system level access.

	* AST-2014-016: Fix crash when receiving an in-dialog INVITE with Replaces in res_pjsip_refer.

	  The implementation of INVITE with Replaces in res_pjsip_refer did not expect them to
	  occur in-dialog. As a result it would incorrectly attempt to hang up a channel it
	  thought was under its control. In reality the channel would be under the control of
	  another thread. When the other thread accessed the channel it would be accessing freed
	  memory and could crash.

	  This change makes res_pjsip_refer not act on an in-dialog INVITE with Replaces.

	* AST-2014-015: Fix race condition in chan_pjsip when sending responses after a CANCEL has been received.

	  Due to the serialized architecture of chan_pjsip there exists a race condition where a CANCEL may
	  be received and processed before responses (such as 180 Ringing, 183 Session Progress, and 200 OK)
	  are sent. Since the session is in an unexpected state PJSIP will assert when this is attempted.

	  This change makes it so that these responses are not sent on disconnected sessions.

	* stringfields: Fix bug in ast_string_fields_copy.

	  ast_string_fields_copy relies on the fact that
	  __ast_string_field_release_active never previously
	  zeroed pool->used, so keeping the existing pointer
	  was "ok".  Now that existing pools can be reset to

	* apps/app_confbridge: Ensure 'normal' users hear message when last marked leaves

	  When r428077 was made for ASTERISK-24522, it failed to take into account users
	  who are neither wait_marked nor end_marked. These users are *also* supposed to
	  hear the 'leader has left the conference' message. Granted, this behaviour is
	  a bit odd; however, that is how it used to work... and behaviour changes are
	  not good.

	  This patch ensures that if there are any 'normal' users present when the last
	  marked user leaves the conference, the message will still be played to them.

	  Note that this regression was caught by the Asterisk Test Suite's
	  confbridge_nominal test, which has a quirky combination of users.

	* app_confbridge: Don't play leader leaving prompt if no one will hear it

	  Consider the following:
	  - A marked user in a conference
	  - One or more end_marked only users in the conference

	  When the marked users leaves, we will be in the conf_state_multi_marked state.
	  This currently will traverse the users, kicking out any who have the end_marked
	  flags. When they are kicked, a full ast_bridge_remove is immediately called on
	  the channels. At this time, we also unilaterally set the need_prompt flag.

	  When the need_prompt flag is set, we then playback a sound to the bridge
	  informing everyone that the leader has left; however, no one is left in the
	  bridge. This causes some odd behaviour for the end_marked users - they are
	  stuck waiting for the bridge to be unlocked. This results in them waiting for
	  5 or 6 seconds of dead air before hearing that they've been kicked.

	  Unfortunately, we do have to keep the bridge locked while we're playing back
	  the 'leader-has-left' prompt. If there are any wait_marked users in the
	  conference, this behaviour can't be easily changed - but we do make the case
	  of the end_marked users better with this patch.

	* Fix race condition that could result in ARI transfer messages not being sent.

	  From reviewboard:

	  "During blind transfer testing, it was noticed that tests were failing
	  occasionally because the ARI blind transfer event was not being sent.
	  After investigating, I detected a race condition in the blind transfer
	  code. When blind transferring a single channel, the actual transfer
	  operation (i.e. removing the transferee from the bridge and directing
	  them to the proper dialplan location) is queued onto the transferee
	  bridge channel. After queuing the transfer operation, the blind transfer
	  Stasis message is published. At the time of publication, snapshots of
	  the channels and bridge involved are created. The ARI subscriber to the
	  blind transfer Stasis message then attempts to determine if the bridge
	  or any of the involved channels are subscribed to by ARI applications.
	  If so, then the blind transfer message is sent to the applications. The
	  way that the ARI blind transfer message handler works is to first see
	  if the transferer channel is subscribed to. If not, then iterate over
	  all the channel IDs in the bridge snapshot and determine if any of
	  those are subscribed to. In the test we were running, the lone
	  transferee channel was subscribed to, so an ARI event should have been
	  sent to our application. Occasionally, though, the bridge snapshot did
	  not have any channels IDs on it at all. Why?

	  The problem is that since the blind transfer operation is handled by a
	  separate thread, it is possible that the transfer will have completed and
	  the channels removed from the bridge before we publish the blind transfer
	  Stasis message. Since the blind transfer has completed, the bridge on
	  which the transfer occurred no longer has any channels on it, so the
	  resulting bridge snapshot has no channels on it. Through investigation of
	  the code, I found that attended transfers can have this issue too for the
	  case where a transferee is transferred to an application."

	  The fix employed here is to decouple the creation of snapshots for the transfer
	  messages from the publication of the transfer messages. This way, snapshots
	  can be created to reflect what they are at the time of the transfer operation.

	* app_confbridge: Play "leader has left" sound even when musiconhold is enabled.

	  Currently if the leader of a conference bridge leaves any participant
	  that has musiconhold enabled will not hear the "leader has left" sound.
	  This is because musiconhold is started and THEN the sound is played.

	  This change makes it so that the sound is played and THEN musiconhold
	  is started. This provides a better experience for users as they may not
	  have known previously why they went back to musiconhold.

	* Stasis: Fix StasisEnd message ordering

	  This change corrects message ordering in cases where a channel-related

	  applications directly without waiting for the channel topic to empty.

	  * StasisStart messages were also being sent directly to apps and are
	    now routed through the stasis message bus properly
	  * Masquerade monitor datastores were being removed at the incorrect
	    time in some cases and were causing StasisEnd messages to not be sent
	  * General refactoring where necessary for the above
	  * Unsubscription on StasisEnd timing changes to prevent additional
	    messages from following the StasisEnd when they shouldn't

	  A channel sanitization function pointer was added to reduce processing
	  and AO2 lookups.

	* main/rtp_engine: Fix crash when processing more than one RTCP report info block

	  Asterisk - in res_rtp_asterisk - only understands a single RTCP report info
	  block. When the RTCP information was refactored in the RTP Engine to be pushed
	  over the Stasis message bus, I put in the hooks into the engine to handle
	  multiple RTCP report info blocks, in the hope that a future RTP implementation
	  would be able to provide that data. Unfortunately, res_rtp_asterisk has a
	  tendency to "lie":
	  (1) It will send RTCP reports with a reception_report_count greater than 1
	      (which is pulled directly from the RTCP packet itself, so that part is
	      correct)
	  (2) It will only provide a single report block

	  When the rtp_engine goes to convert this to a JSON blob, hilarity ensues as it
	  looks for a report block that doesn't exist.

	  This patch updates the rtp_engine to be a bit more skeptical about what it is
	  presented with. While this could also be fixed in res_rtp_asterisk, this patch
	  prefers to fix it in the engine for two reasons:
	  (1) The engine is designed to work with multiple RTP implementation, and hence
	      having it be more robust is a good thing (tm)
	  (2) res_rtp_asterisk's handling of RTCP information is "fun". It should report
	      the correct reception_report_count; ideally it should also be giving us all
	      of the blocks - but it is *definitely* not designed to do that. Going down
	      that road is a non-trivial effort.

	* bridge_native_rtp: Fix T.38 issues with remote bridges

	  After r425242 the fax/sip/directmedia_reinvite_t38 test started failing due to
	  the surviving channel not being re-INVITEd back from T.38 to audio. This patch
	  fixes that bug - a deeper explanation of what happened follows.

	  When two RTP channels are in a native bridge, the bridging layer will
	  investigate each via the get_rtp_info glue callback. This callback returns the
	  native bridge preference of the channel *at that moment in time* (that part is
	  key). At different points during the bridging, the native bridging layer will
	  inform the RTP capable channels of the status of the bridge via the update_peer
	  glue callback.

	  In a T.38 scenario with audio direct media, the sequence of events will often
	  look like the following:
	   * SIP/A and SIP/B both have audio and enter a native bridge.
	   * Asterisk re-INVITEs audio between SIP/A and SIP/B directly (via an
	     update_peer callback).
	   * SIP/A sends a re-INVITE to T.38, which causes Asterisk to send a re-INVITE
	     to T.38 to SIP/B. Assuming everyone 200 OKs the process, the UDPTL stack
	     receives UDPTL packets in Asterisk from both endpoints. From the perspective
	     of the channels, we are now in a local bridge for T.38, even though we are
	     technically still in a remote bridge in bridge_native_rtp. (YAY!)
	   * When one side hangs up, bridge_native_rtp is told to stop bridging. It then
	     re-evaluates the channels and asks them how they are bridged - and since
	     T.38 is enabled, they reply with a Local bridge (which is correct), but is
	     wrong because the audio portion is still technically in a remote bridge.
	   * Asterisk releases the surviving channel, whose audio is *not* re-INVITED
	     back to Asterisk as bridge_native_rtp incorrectly assumes that it was in a
	     local bridge.

	  Ironically, prior to r425242, this used to work mostly due to a fluke in the
	  bridging layer.

	  The purpose of the get_rtp_info callback shouldn't be modified: it should tell
	  the bridging layer what kind of bridge the channel prefers at that moment in
	  time. If you have T.38 enabled, that *must* be a local bridge, as the UDPTPL
	  stack must be in the media path. As such, this patch does not modify that
	  part of the code.

	  However, we have to tell the channels to re-evaluate themselves when they come
	  out of a native bridge, since we can no longer trust the get_rtp_info callbacks
	  when the native bridge is being stopped. Something else may have changed in the
	  channels, and they may now be lying to us. As such, this patch makes it so that
	  we unilaterally tell the channels that they are no longer bridged via the
	  update_peer callback. This is actually what the channels expect anyway: code in
	  both chan_sip and chan_pjsip's callbacks look at the T.38 state and - if they
	  were in T.38 - send a re-INVITE to get the audio back to Asterisk.

	* res_pjsip: Ensure in-dialog responses have an endpoint associated.

	  When handling incoming messages we determine if it is associated with

	  to use for the message. Previously this would pass the endpoint to the
	  endpoint lookup module to actually place the endpoint completely on the
	  message. For in-dialog responses, however, this did not occur as

	  This change just places the endpoint in the expected spot immediately
	  instead of relying on the endpoint lookup module. In-dialog responses

	* main/file.c: fix possible extra ast_module_unref to format modules.

	  fn_wrapper only adds a reference to the format's module if the file
	  was able to be opened.  If not this causes an unmatched
	  ast_module_unref in filestream_destructor.  Move ast_module_ref to
	  get_stream.

	* Make the disable_tcp_switch PJSIP system object enabled by default.

	  Testing has shown repeatedly that PJSIP's default behavior of switching
	  automatically to TCP for large messages can cause issues. The most common
	  issues are that devices that we are communicating with do not handle the
	  switch to TCP gracefully, thus causing situations such as broken calls or
	  broken subscriptions. Now, in order to have this behavior happen, you must
	  opt into it. The sample file has been updated to warn that enabling the
	  TCP switch behavior may cause issues for you, so use at your own risk.

	* config: Make text_file_save and 'dialplan save' escape semicolons in values.

	  When a config file is read, an unescaped semicolon signals comments which are
	  stripped from the value before it's stored.  Escaped semicolons are then
	  unescaped and become part of the value.  Both of these behaviors are normal
	  and expected.  When the config is serialized either by 'dialplan save' or
	  AMI/UpdateConfig however, the now unescaped semicolons are written as-is.
	  If you actually reload the file just saved, the unescaped semicolons are
	  now treated as start of comments.

	  Since true comments are stripped on read, any semicolons in
	  ast_variable.value must have been escaped originally.  This patch
	  re-escapes semicolons in ast_variable.values before they're written to
	  file either by 'dialplan save' or config/ast_config_text_file_save which
	  is called by AMI/UpdateConfig. I also fixed a few pre-existing formatting
	  issues nearby in pbx_config.c

	* res_pjsip_outbound_registration: Add virtual line support.

	  Virtual line support establishes a relationship between messages
	  related to an outbound registration and a local endpoint. This is
	  accomplished by attaching a parameter to the Contact of the outbound
	  registration and looking for it on any received requests. If the
	  parameter exists and can be matched to an outbound registration
	  the configured endpoint is associated with the request.

	* res_pjsip: Add disable_tcp_switch option.

	  When a packet exceeds the MTU, pjproject will switch from UDP to TCP.  In
	  some circumstances (on some networks), this can cause some issues with
	  messages not getting sent to the correct destination - and can also cause
	  connections to get dropped due to quirks in pjproject deciding to
	  terminate TCP connections with no messages.

	  While fixing the routing/messaging issues is important, having a
	  configuration option in Asterisk that tells pjproject to not switch over
	  to TCP would be useful.  That way, if some glitch is discovered on some
	  other network/site, we can at least disable the behavior until a fix is
	  put into place.

	* res_pjsip_exten_state: PJSIPShowSubscriptionsInbound causes crash

	  device is subscribed for extension state then the associated subscription state
	  object can't be located.  The code then attempts to dereference a NULL object.

	* main/bridge: Destroy features struct on off nominal path during bridge impart

	  When a channel is imparted to a bridge, the invocation of the function may
	  provide an ast_bridge_features struct. Upon passing this to ast_bridge_impart,
	  the caller must assume that ownership has passed to the function, as in all
	  paths the function destroys the struct prior to returning (as its purpose is
	  to configure the behavior of the channel while in the bridge). On one off
	  nominal path - where the channel already has a PBX thread - the struct was not
	  being destroyed.

	  This patch fixes that glitch.

	* res/res_phoneprov: Fix crash on shutdown caused by container cleanup

	  In res_phoneprov, unloading the module first destroys the http_routes
	  container, followed by the users. However, users may have a route in
	  the http_routes container; the validity of this container is not checked
	  in the users destructor. Hence, we hit an assert as the container has already
	  been set to NULL.

	  This patch does two things:
	  (1) It adds a sanity check in the user destructor (because why not)
	  (2) It switches the order of destruction, so that users are disposed of prior
	      to the HTTP routes they may hold a reference to.

	  Note that this crash was caught by the Test Suite (go go testing!)

	* codec_dahdi: Cannot use struct ast_translator.core_{src,src}_codec.

	  This fixes a Segmentation fault introduced in r419044 "media formats: re-architect
	  handling of media for performance improvements".

	  The problem is that codec_dahdi was using core_src_codec and core_dst_codec in the
	  ast_translator structure when these fields were never set. Now instead of trying to map
	  the new core codec descriptions to the way DAHDI defines different codecs, we will store
	  the DAHDI specific formats in 'struct translator' directly so we can refer to them without
	  mapping.

	  This also allows us to remove the "global_format_map" structure, since we can now query
	  the list of translators directly to make sure we do not ever register a DAHDI based
	  translator for a specific path more than once and eliminate the need to keep the list and
	  the map in sync.

	* AST-2014-011: Fix POODLE security issues

	  There are two aspects to the vulnerability:
	  (1) res_jabber/res_xmpp use SSLv3 only. This patch updates the module to use
	      TLSv1+. At this time, it does not refactor res_jabber/res_xmpp to use the
	      TCP/TLS core, which should be done as an improvement at a latter date.
	  (2) The TCP/TLS core, when tlsclientmethod/sslclientmethod is left unspecified,
	      will default to the OpenSSL SSLv23_method. This method allows for all
	      ecnryption methods, including SSLv2/SSLv3. A MITM can exploit this by
	      forcing a fallback to SSLv3, which leaves the server vulnerable to POODLE.
	      This patch adds WARNINGS if a user uses SSLv2/SSLv3 in their configuration,
	      and explicitly disables SSLv2/SSLv3 if using SSLv23_method.

	  For TLS clients, Asterisk will default to TLSv1+ and WARN if SSLv2 or SSLv3 is
	  explicitly chosen. For TLS servers, Asterisk will no longer support SSLv2 or
	  SSLv3.

	  Much thanks to abelbeck for reporting the vulnerability and providing a patch
	  for the res_jabber/res_xmpp modules.

	* build: Force -fsigned-char on platforms where the default for char is unsigned

	  gcc on the ARM platform defaults 'char' to 'unsigned char' whereas Intel and
	  SPARC default to 'signed char'.  This is only an issue in the rare cases where
	  negative values are assigned to a 'char' but this this patch insures
	  compatibility by detecting platforms that default to 'unsigned' and adding an
	  '-fsigned-char' flag to _ASTCFLAGS.

	  If compiling for ARM (native or cross-compile) be sure to run ./bootstrap.sh
	  and ./configure to regenerate the build files.  You shouldn't have to do this
	  for Intel or SPARC.

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Revert 425924

	  This patch for r425924 introduced a bug, wherein sending an INVITE request
	  with no SDP would cause Asterisk to not send an SDP Offer in the 200
	  OK. The current structure of res_pjsip_sdp_rtp is a bit hard to deal with
	  to fix this, as create_outgoing_sdp has no knowledge of whether or not it is
	  creating an SDP as a new Offer or an Answer. This is something of an oversight
	  in the callback definition, as the caller of it does have this information.



	  git-svn-id: https://origsvn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/trunk@425945 65c4cc65-6c06-0410-ace0-fbb531ad65f3

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Remove left over reference to override_prefs

	  The usage of the local override_prefs variable in create_outgoing_sdp_stream
	  was previously to track an override format preference set by PJSIP_MEDIA_OFFER.
	  Now, however, that function simply sets the joint capabilities structure,
	  session->req_caps. During the media format rework, the override_prefs was
	  instead used to check if there were any formats in session->req_caps.

	  However, this usage isn't useful in create_outgoing_sdp_stream.
	  session->req_caps contains the negotiated formats for *all* streams, not just
	  the current one being created. Thus, so long as any stream of any type has
	  provided a format, override_prefs will be non-zero. Hence, its usage in
	  checking whether or not we should look at the formats on the endpoint or
	  the joint capabilities is generally useless.

	  There's only two things useful to check:
	  (1) Does the endpoint have a format for the media type?
	  (2) Did we negotiate a format for the media type?

	  If either of those is a 'no', then we must kill the media stream.

	* res_pjsip_session/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Be more tolerant of offers

	  When an inbound SDP offer is received, Asterisk currently makes a few
	  incorrection assumptions:

	  (1) If the offer contains more than a single audio/video stream, Asterisk will
	      reject the entire stream with a 488. This is an overly strict response;
	      generally, Asterisk should accept the media streams that it can accept and
	      decline the others.
	  (2) If the offer contains a declined media stream, Asterisk will attempt to
	      process it anyway. This can result in attempting to match format
	      capabilities on a declined media stream, leading to a 488. Asterisk should
	      simply ignore declined media streams.
	  (3) Asterisk will currently attempt to handle offers with AVPF with
	      use_avpf=No/AVP with use_avpf=Yes. This mismatch results in invalid SDP
	      answers being sent in response. If there is a mismatch between the media
	      type being offered and the configuration, Asterisk must reject the offer
	      with a 488.

	  This patch does the following:
	  * Asterisk will accept SDP offers with at least one media stream that it can
	    use. Some WARNING messages have been dropped to NOTICEs as a result.
	  * Asterisk will not accept an offer with a media type that doesn't match its
	    configuration.
	  * Asterisk will ignore declined media streams properly.

	  This change adds a module which is configurable using the keep_alive_interval setting in the

	* channels/chan_sip: Respect outboundproxy setting when sending qualify requests

	  The outboundproxy setting is currently ignored when sending OPTIONS requests
	  as a result of the qualify setting. This means that if an Asterisk server is
	  unable to send the packet directly to a peer, it is unable to qualify any
	  non-inbound registered peer (e.g. a peer SIP Trunk).

	  This patch grabs the outboundproxy information for a peer when a qualify
	  attempt is being constructed and, if it finds the information, uses it
	  when sending the OPTIONS request.

	* bridge_native_rtp: Fix audio issues when moving from remote bridge to softmix

	  When a native RTP bridge that is remotely bridging its participants switches
	  to a softmix bridge, it may not properly re-INVITE the media for one or both
	  participants back to Asterisk. This is due to the current bridge_native_rtp
	  code only re-INVITEs if it believes the channel will survive the bridge
	  operation. Currently, that code is failing, as it expects the channels to
	  have a soft hangup flag set on it indicating that a redirect has occurred
	  or that the channel is going to leave the bridge. (The code did not take into
	  account a smart bridge operation).

	  This patch also renames a few things to be more reflective of the underlying
	  types.

	* res_phoneprov: Create accessor for ast_phoneprov_std_variable_lookup

	  Based on feedback from Richard, I created an accessor for
	  res_phoneprov/ast_phoneprov_std_variable_lookup and added
	  load priority to AST_MODULE_INFO.

	* res_fax: Fix reference leak caused by gateway sessions

	  Fax gateway session objects can be re-used, causing the
	  same gateway session to be added to faxregistry.container
	  more than once.  This change causes fax_session_new to
	  remove the reserved session from the container before
	  it's id is changed, ensuring it's possible for the
	  session to be freed.

	* stasis_channels.c: Resolve unfinished Dials when doing masquerades (Part 2)

	  Masquerades into and out of channels that are involved in a dial operation
	  don't create the expected dial end event.  The missing dial end event goes
	  against the model for things like CDRs and generating Dial end manager
	  actions and such.

	  There are four cases:

	  1) A channel masquerades into the caller channel.  The case happens when
	  performing a blonde transfer using the channel driver's protocol.

	  2) A channel masquerades into a callee channel.  The case happens when
	  performing a directed call pickup.

	  3) The caller channel masquerades out of dial.  The case happens when
	  using the Bridge application on the caller channel.

	  4) A callee channel masquerades out of dial.  The case happens when using
	  the Bridge application on a peer channel.

	  As it turned out, all four cases need to be handled instead of just the
	  first one.

	* manager/config: Support templates and non-unique category names via AMI

	  This patch provides the capability to manipulate templates and categories
	  with non-unique names via AMI.

	  Summary of changes:

	  GetConfig and GetConfigJSON: Added "Filter" parameter:  A comma separated list
	  of name_regex=value_regex expressions which will cause only categories whose
	  variables match all expressions to be considered.  The special variable name
	  TEMPLATES can be used to control whether templates are included.  Passing
	  'include' as the value will include templates along with normal categories.
	  Passing 'restrict' as the value will restrict the operation to ONLY templates.
	  Not specifying a TEMPLATES expression results in the current default behavior
	  which is to not include templates.

	  UpdateConfig: NewCat now includes options for allowing duplicate category
	  names, indicating if the category should be created as a template, and
	  specifying templates the category should inherit from.  The rest of the
	  actions now accept a filter string as defined above.  If there are non-unique
	  category names, you can now update specific ones based on variable values.

	  To facilitate the new capabilities in manager, corresponding changes had to be
	  made to config, most notably the addition of filter criteria to many of the
	  APIs.  In some cases it was easy to change the references to use the new
	  prototype but others would have required touching too many files for this
	  patch so a wrapper with the original prototype was created.  Macros couldn't
	  be used in this case because it would break binary compatibility with modules
	  such as res_digium_phone that are linked to real symbols.

	* bridge: During a smart bridge operation provide a more complete bridge to the old technology.

	  When a smart bridge operation occurs and a bridge transitions from one
	  technology to another the old technology is provided the channels formerly
	  in it and told that they are leaving. Unfortunately the bridge provided
	  along with them is incomplete. The bridge, despite there being channels in it,
	  contains none. This forces technology implementations to have additional
	  logic when channels are leaving or to store their own duplicated
	  state.

	  This change makes the bridge more complete so it contains the expected
	  channels. Now that the bridge is complete special logic within
	  bridge_native_rtp is no longer needed and has been removed.

	  This patch makes res_phoneprov more modular so other modules (like pjsip)
	  can provide configuration information instead of res_phoneprov relying solely
	  on users.conf and sip.conf.  To accomplish this a new ast_phoneprov public API
	  is now exposed which allows config providers to register themselves, set
	  defaults (server profile, etc) and add user extensions.

	  * ast_phoneprov_provider_register registers the provider and provides callbacks
	    for loading default settings and loading users.
	  * ast_phoneprov_provider_unregister clears the defaults and users.
	  * ast_phoneprov_add_extension should be called once for each user/extension
	    by the provider's load_users callback to add them.
	  * ast_phoneprov_delete_extension deletes one extension.
	  * ast_phoneprov_delete_extensions deletes all extensions for the provider.

	* safe_asterisk: Don't automatically exceed MAXFILES value of 2^20.

	  On systems with lots of RAM (e.g. 24GB) /proc/sys/fs/file-max divided
	  by two can exceed the per-process file limit of 2^20. This patch
	  ensures the value is capped.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Allow only UDP ICE candidates.

	  The underlying library, pjnath, that res_rtp_asterisk uses for ICE
	  support does not have support for ICE-TCP. As candidates are
	  passed through directly to it this can cause error messages to occur
	  when it receives something unexpected (such as a TCP candidate).
	  This change merely ignores all non-UDP candidates so they never
	  reach pjnath.

	* pjsip/dialplan_functions: Handle PJSIP_MEDIA_OFFER called on non-PJSIP channels

	  Calling PJSIP_MEDIA_OFFER on a non-PJSIP channel is hazardous to your health.

	  FRACKing on assertion error, and quite likely crashing.

	  This patch adds checks to the read/write callbacks that ensure that the channel

	* res_pjsip: Prevent crashes when PJPROJECT presents an rdata with no message

	  When a message that exceeds the PJ_MAX_PKT_SIZE is sent over a reliable
	  transport, it is possible (although it shouldn't occur) for pjproject to pass
	  up an rdata object with a NULL msg in the msg_info. Needless to say, things
	  that attempt to dereference this are in for a rough ride.

	  In particular, this caused crashes in three different locations, all of which
	  are 'low level' enough to intercept an rdata object early in processing:

	  (1) res_pjsip_logger
	  (2) res_hep_pjsip
	  (3) res_pjsip/distributor

	  Anything that can intercept an rdata object before res_pjsip/distributor should
	  be defensive when looking at the received packet.

	* audiohooks: Reevaluate the bridge technology when an audiohook is added or removed.

	  Adding a mixmonitor to a channel causes the bridge to change technologies
	  from native to simple_bridge so the call can be recorded.  However, when
	  the mixmonitor is stopped the bridge does not switch back to the native
	  technology.

	  * Added unbridge requests to reevaluate the bridge when a channel
	  audiohook is removed.

	  * Moved the unbridge request into ast_audiohook_attach() ensure that the
	  bridge reevaluates whenever an audiohook is attached.  This simplified the
	  mixmonitor and chan_spy start code as well.

	  * Added defensive code to stop_mixmonitor_full() in case additional
	  arguments are ever added to the StopMixMonitor application.

	  * Made ast_framehook_detach() not do an unbridge request if the framehook
	  does not exist.

	  * Made ast_framehook_list_fixup() do an unbridge request if there are any
	  framehooks.  Also simplified the loop.

	* chan_pjsip: Fix deadlock when masquerading PJSIP channels.

	  Performing a directed call pickup resulted in a deadlock when PJSIP
	  channels were involved.

	  A masquerade needs to hold onto the channel locks while it swaps channel
	  information between the two channels involved in the masquerade.  With
	  PJSIP channels, the fixup routine needed to push a fixup task onto the
	  PJSIP channel's serializer.  Unfortunately, if the serializer was also
	  processing a task that needed to lock the channel, you get deadlock.

	  * Added a new control frame that is used to notify the channels that a
	  masquerade is about to start and when it has completed.

	  * Added the ability to query taskprocessors if the current thread is the
	  taskprocessor thread.

	  * Added the ability to suspend/unsuspend the PJSIP serializer thread so a
	  masquerade could fixup the PJSIP channel without using the serializer.

	* Manager: Add missing fields and documentation for CoreShowChannels

	  This corrects some issues introduced in the responses to the
	  CoreShowChannels AMI command as well as adding documentation for the
	  responses. The command in Asterisk 12 was missing the following fields:
	  Duration, Application, ApplicationData, and BridgedChannel and
	  BridgedUniqueID (replaced with BridgeId).

	* res_pjsip: Make transport cipher option accept a comma separated list of cipher names.

	  Improvements to the res_pjsip transport cipher option.

	  * Made the cipher option accept a comma separated list of OpenSSL cipher
	  names.  Users of realtime will be glad if they have more than one name to
	  list.

	  * Added the CLI command 'pjsip list ciphers' so a user can know what
	  OpenSSL names are available for the cipher option.

	  * Updated the cipher option online XML documentation to specify what is
	  expected for the value.

	  * Updated pjsip.conf.sample to not indicate that ALL is acceptable since
	  ALL does not imply a preference order for the ciphers and PJSIP does not
	  simply pass the string to OpenSSL for interpretation.

	* res_pjsip: document use of rewrite_contact in sample conf

	  Without setting rewrite_contact, an invite to an endpoint
	  behind NAT will not reach it - unless the endpoint itself
	  uses STUN or TURN to discover it's public URI.  Thus, the
	  use of this should be in the sample documentation.

	* res_pjsip: Add 'dtls_fingerprint' option to configure DTLS fingerprint hash.

	  During the latest update to DTLS-SRTP support the ability to configure
	  the hash used for fingerprints was added. This gave us two supported ones:
	  SHA-1 and SHA-256. The default was accordingly updated to SHA-256.
	  Unfortunately this configuration ability was not exposed within res_pjsip.
	  This change adds a dtls_fingerprint option that controls it.

	* PJSIP: Handle defaults properly

	  This updates the code behind PJSIP configuration options with custom
	  handlers to deal with the assigned default values properly where it
	  makes sense and adjusting the default value where it doesn't. Before
	  applying this patch, there were several cases where the default value
	  for an option would prevent that config section from loading properly.

	* PJSIP: Force transport on contact rewrite

	  If contact rewriting is enabled but the contact differs in transport
	  from what is actually being used, messages after the initial INVITE
	  transaction can be sent to an incorrect transport/port combination. In
	  the case where this bug occurred the remote party never received a BYE
	  since it was sent to the remote party's TCP port over UDP.

	* res_pjsip_session: Reduce SDP size by removing duplicate connection lines.

	  Due to the architecture of how media streams are handled each individual
	  handler adds connection details (IP address) for it. The first media stream
	  is then used as the top level SDP connection line. In practice each
	  line ends up being the same so to reduce the SDP size stream-level connection
	  information is also added to the SDP if it differs from the top level SDP
	  connection line.

	* res_pjsip_session: Add additional checks for delaying session refreshes.

	  There are certain situations which no checks existed for which need to prevent

	  has been established. Checks for these have been added.

	  Additionally COLP related UPDATEs were including SDP when it is not needed.

	* core: Don't allow free to mean ast_free (and malloc, etc..).

	  This gets rid of most old libc free/malloc/realloc and replaces them
	  with ast_free and friends. When compiling with MALLOC_DEBUG you'll
	  notice it when you're mistakenly using one of the libc variants. For
	  the legacy cases you can define WRAP_LIBC_MALLOC before including
	  asterisk.h.

	  Even better would be if the errors were also enabled when compiling
	  without MALLOC_DEBUG, but that's a slightly more invasive header
	  file change.

	  Those compiling addons/format_mp3 will need to rerun
	  ./contrib/scripts/get_mp3_source.sh.

	* pjsip_options.c: Fix race condition stopping periodic out of dialog OPTIONS request.

	  The crash on the issues is a result of an invalid transport configuration
	  change when asterisk is restarted.  The attempt to send the qualify
	  request fails and we cleaned up.  However, the callback is also called
	  which results in a double unref of the objects involved.

	  * Put a wrapper around pjsip_endpt_send_request() to detect when the
	  passed in callback is called because of an error so callers can know to
	  not cleanup.

	  * Made send_request_cb() able to handle repeated challenges (Up to 10).

	  * Fix periodic endpoint qualify OPTIONS sched deletion race by avoiding
	  it.  The sched entry will no longer self stop and must be externally
	  stopped.

	  * Added REF_DEBUG description tags to struct sched_data in
	  pjsip_options.c.

	  * Fix some off-nominal ref leaks in schedule_qualify(),
	  qualify_and_schedule().

	  * Reordered pjsip_options.c module start/stop code to cleanup better on
	  error.

	* Make CDR and CEL unit tests less FRACKy.

	  Prior to this commit, CDR and CEL tests were expected to trigger
	  FRACKs (i.e. assertions) due to the fact that the channels they
	  create have no formats on them. Some code was independently added
	  recently that attempts to prevent FRACKs from occurring by failing
	  early when attempting to set up translation paths if one or both
	  channels support no formats. Unfortunately, this attempt to be helpful
	  made the CDR and CEL tests go from simply FRACKing to outright
	  failing and in some cases, failing so badly as to crash Asterisk.

	  This commit seeks to correct past mistakes by adding the ulaw format
	  to channels created by the CDR and CEL unit tests. This makes setting
	  up translation paths succeed, eliminates previously-seen FRACKs, and
	  ultimately causes the unit tests to succeed again.

	* main/channel: Unlock channel in off-nominal path

	  In r423414 (13) / r423415 (trunk), an API call that determines if a format
	  capability structure is empty was added. This returns true if the format
	  capability structure is completely empty or "none". A check for this was added
	  in channel.c's set_format call. Unfortunately, when this check was true, it
	  returned from the function while still holding the channel lock. This caused
	  the CDR unit tests - which have a tendency to create channels with no formats -
	  to deadlock. Whoops.

	  This patch unlocks the channel on the off-nominal path.

	* PJSIP: Prevent T38 framehook being put on wrong channel

	  This change gives framehooks a reverse-direction masquerade callback in
	  addition to chan_fixup_cb similar to the callback added to datastores
	  to handle the same situation. The new callback provides the same
	  parameters as the fixup callback, but is called on the new channel's
	  framehooks before moving framehooks from the old channel to the new
	  channel. This gives the framehooks an oppurtunity to decide whether
	  they should remain on the new channel or be removed.

	  This new callback is used to prevent the PJSIP T.38 framehook from
	  remaining on a masqueraded channel if the new channel is not also a
	  PJSIP channel. This was causing a crash when a local channel was
	  masqueraded into a PJSIP channel and the framehook was executed on the
	  local channel since the channel's tech private data was not structured
	  as expected.

	* utils: Create ast_strsep function that ignores separators inside quotes

	  This function acts like strsep with three exceptions...
	  * The separator is a single character instead of a string.
	  * Separators inside quotes are treated literally instead of like separators.
	  * You can elect to have leading and trailing whitespace and quotes
	  stripped from the result and have '\' sequences unescaped.

	  Like strsep, ast_strsep maintains no internal state and you can call it
	  recursively using different separators on the same storage.

	  Also like strsep, for consistent results, consecutive separators are not
	  collapsed so you may get an empty string as a valid result.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Add some type safety when generating NOTIFY bodies.

	  res_pjsip_pubsub has two separate checks that it makes when a SUBSCRIBE
	  arrives.
	  * It checks that there is a subscription handler for the Event
	  * It checks that there are body generators for the types in the Accept header

	  The problem is, there's nothing that ensures that these two things will
	  actually mesh with each other. For instance, Asterisk will accept a subscription
	  to MWI that accepts pidf+xml bodies. That doesn't make sense.

	  With this commit, we add some type information to the mix. Subscription
	  handlers state they generate data of type X, and body generators state
	  that they consume data of type X. This way, Asterisk doesn't end up in
	  some hilariously mismatched situation like the one in the previous paragraph.

	* res_pjsip: ami: Fix error in AMI output when an endpoint has no transport

	  When no transport is associated to an endpoint, the AMI output for
	  PJSIPShowEndpoint indicates an error instead of silently ignoring the
	  missing transport.

	  This patch causes the error to appear only if a transport was specified
	  on the endpoint and the transport doesn't exist.  It also fixes an issue
	  with counting the objects that were actually found.

	* Only install dahdi_span_config_hook if DAHDI is enabled

	  This patch changes the install to only install the hook script if
	  DAHDI is enabled. It also adds the script to the uninstall task, and
	  moves the DAHDI_UDEV_HOOK_DIR variable so that it's not between the
	  _MAKEOPTS variables and their comment.

	  This allows installs which specify a --prefix to work normally, as
	  long as they don't enable DAHDI.

	* config: bug: Fix SEGV in ast_category_insert when matching category isn't found

	  If you call ast_category_insert with a match category that doesn't exist, the
	  list traverse runs out of 'next' categories and you get a SEGV.  This patch
	  adds check for the end-of-list condition and changes the signature to return
	  an int for success/failure indication instead of a void.

	  The only consumer of this function is manager and it was also changed to use
	  the return value.

	* Voicemail: get correct duration when copying file to vm

	  Changes made during format improvements resulted in the
	  recording to voicemail option 'm' of the MixMonitor app
	  writing a zero length duration in the msgXXXX.txt file.

	  This change introduces a new function ast_ratestream(),
	  which provides the sample rate of the format associated
	  with the stream, and updates the app_voicemail function
	  for ast_app_copy_recording_to_vm to calculate the right
	  duration.

	  3. The TURN client did not set up client binding causing needless bandwidth usage.
	  4. The code no longer updates address information on each packet.
	  5. STUN traffic was getting looped back to Asterisk instead of going through the
	  TURN server.
	  6. Synchronization now ensures things are completely setup or destroyed.
	  7. Logging now reflects the target the TURN server is sending to/receiving from
	  on our behalf.

	* Remove undocumented default behavior of ast_play_and_record_full acceptdtmf.

	  ast_play_and_record_full() has a parameter called "acceptdtmf" that is a
	  string of acceptable DTMF digits that may be pressed by a caller to end
	  and accept the recording.

	  ARI uses this function in order to perform recording, and it provides
	  options for what is passed as acceptdtmf to ast_play_and_record_full().
	  By default, ARI passes an empty string, with the intention that no DTMF
	  can be used to end the recording.

	  The problem is that ast_play_and_record_full() attempts to be "helpful"
	  by setting "#" as the acceptdtmf if an empty string or NULL pointer
	  has been passed in. With ARI, this results in unexpected behavior
	  occurring if you have attempted to intercept "#" yourself in order
	  to perform some other manipulation of the live recording.

	  This change removes the "helpful" behavior by no longer accepting
	  "#" as a default acceptdtmf if none is specified by the caller of
	  ast_play_and_record_full(). This makes the ARI scenario work as
	  expected.

	  The other callers of ast_play_and_record_full() are app_voicemail
	  and app_minivm, and in both cases, they pass an explicit "#" to
	  ast_play_and_record_full() as acceptdtmf, so they are unaffected
	  by this change.

	* Pre-allocate transmission data buffer for RLS NOTIFY requests.

	  PJSIP, unless a constant is modified at compilation time, limits
	  SIP requests to 4000 bytes. Full-state RLS notifications can easily
	  exceed this limit with moderately small lists.

	  This changeset allows for Asterisk to work around this size limit by
	  performing its own allocation of the transmission data buffer. This
	  way, Asterisk can allocate a buffer that exceeds the built-in maximum.

	  We still impose our own limit of 64000 bytes, mainly because making
	  allocations larger than that is a bit absurd.

	* main/cdr: Copy over location information during a fork

	  When a CDR is forked, a new CDR is created and appended to the CDR chain for
	  the Party A. The forked CDR starts life off as a clone of the last
	  non-finalized for the particular Party A. In the past, merely copying over
	  the snapshots for Party A/Party B would be sufficient. However, as the CDRs
	  now contain cached information from Party A - specifically application/data,
	  context, and extension - we need to copy that over during a fork as well.

	  Huzzah for unit tests catching this when the context/extension were derived
	  from a cached value on the CDR instead of on Party A.

	* main/rtp_engine: Format NTP timestamps as unsigned ints

	  On some systems, a timeval's tv_sec/tv_usec will be unsigned lont ints, as
	  opposed to long ints. When the RTP engine formats these as strings, it was
	  previously formatting them as signed integers, which can result in some
	  odd negative timestamp values (particularly on 32-bit systems). This patch
	  formats the values as unsigned long integers.

	* main/cdrs: Preserve context/extension when executing a Macro or GoSub

	  The context/extension in a CDR is generally considered the destination of a
	  call. When looking at a 2-party call CDR, users will typically be presented
	  with the following:

	  context    exten      channel     dest_channel app  data
	  default    1000       SIP/8675309 SIP/1000     Dial SIP/1000,,20

	  However, if the Dial actually takes place in a Macro, the current behaviour
	  in 12 will result in the following CDR:

	  context    exten      channel     dest_channel app  data
	  macro-dial s          SIP/8675309 SIP/1000     Dial SIP/1000,,20

	  The same is true of a GoSub:

	  context    exten      channel     dest_channel app  data
	  subs       dial_stuff SIP/8675309 SIP/1000     Dial SIP/1000,,20

	  This generally makes the context/exten fields less than useful.

	  It isn't hard to preserve these values in the CDR state machine; however, we
	  need to have something that informs us when a channel is executing a
	  subroutine. Prior to this patch, there isn't anything that does this.

	  This patch solves this problem by adding a new channel flag,
	  AST_FLAG_SUBROUTINE_EXEC. This flag is set on a channel when it executes a
	  Macro or a GoSub. The CDR engine looks for this value when updating a Party A
	  snapshot; if the flag is present, we don't override the context/exten on the
	  main CDR object. In a funny quirk, executing a hangup handler must *not* abide
	  by this logic, as the endbeforehexten logic assumes that the user wants to see
	  data that occurs in hangup logic, which includes those subroutines. Since
	  those execute outside of a typical Dial operation (and will typically have
	  their own dedicated CDR anyway), this is unlikely to cause any heartburn.

	* main/cdr: Fix crash/memory consumption in CDRs in multi-party bridge scenarios

	  This patch fixes an issue where CDRs would get stuck generating an infinite
	  number of CDRs, eventually crashing Asterisk (and consuming a lot of memory
	  along the way).

	  When a channel enters into a multi-party bridge, the CDR engine creates
	  mappings of each participant to each other participant, picking the 'A' party
	  as it goes. So, if we have four channels in a multi-party bridge (Alice, Bob,
	  Charlie, Denise), we would have something like:

	  Alice => Bob
	  Alice => Charlie
	  Alice => Denise
	  Bob => Charlie
	  Bob => Denise
	  Charlie => Denise

	  This works fine when participants enter the bridge a single time.

	  When a participant leaves a bridge, the CDRs for that channel are transitioned
	  to a finalized state.

	  The bug occurs if Bob rejoins. When the CDR engine creates mappings between the
	  channels, it walks through all the participants currently in the bridge, and
	  realizes that no one in the bridge can create a CDR with the channel (Bob).
	  As such it creates a new CDR for the candidate and appends it to that
	  candidate's chain. Unfortunately, on this particular code path, it doesn't
	  stop traversing the candidate's chain. Since we just added ourselves to the
	  chain, this causes the loop to keep going, constantly adding new CDRs.

	  This patch makes it so the engine bails when it creates a CDR match in this
	  case.

	* Resolve race condition where channels enter dialplan application before media has been negotiated.

	  Testsuite tests will occasionally fail because on reception of a 200 OK SIP response,
	  an AST_CONTROL_ANSWER frame is queued prior to when media has finished being
	  negotiated. This is because session supplements are called into before PJSIP's
	  inv_session code has told us that media has been updated. Sometimes the queued answer
	  frame is handled by the PBX thread before the ensuing media negotiations occur, causing
	  a test failure.

	  As it turns out, there is another place that session supplements could be called into, which is
	  after media has finished getting negotiated. What this commit introduces is a means for session
	  supplements to indicate when they wish to be called into when handling an incoming SIP response.
	  By default, all session supplements will be run at the same point that they were prior to this
	  commit. However, session supplements may indicate that they wish to be handled earlier than
	  normal on redirects, or they may indicate they wish to be handled after media has been negotiated.

	  In this changeset, two session supplements have been updated to indicate a preference for when
	  they should be run: res_pjsip_diversion executes before handling redirection in order to get
	  information from the Diversion header, and chan_pjsip now handles responses to INVITEs after
	  media negotiation to fix the race condition mentioned previously.

	* res_stasis: Don't play MoH to channels by default when added to holding bridges

	  When ARI manipulates a bridge, it generally doesn't care what the mixing
	  technology is. Operations on a bridge initiated through ARI should perform
	  their action in generally the same way, regardless of the bridge's mixing
	  technology. While the mixing technology may determine how media flows to
	  channels, the actual operations on a bridge themselves should be the same.

	  Currently, this isn't the case with holding bridges. When a channel joins
	  without a role, MoH is started on that channel automatically. Subsequent bridge
	  operations that would stop MoH would fail (as there is no Announcer channel
	  playing MoH to the bridge). Starting MoH on the bridge will also create two
	  MoH streams: one from the MoH being played on the participant channel, and one
	  from the announcer channel. From the perspective of ARI users, this is
	  counter-intuitive - I would not expect MoH to be started for me. The mixing
	  technology determines how media is shared between participants, not the
	  application experience.

	  This patch does the following:
	   * The Stasis bridge class now inspects channels as they are going into a
	     bridge. If the bridge has a holding capability, and the channel has no
	     roles, we give it a participant role and mark the default behaviour to have
	     no entertainment. This allows addChannel operations to continue to set a
	     participant role with an entertainment option if it felt like it (or could
	     do it).
	   * The music on hold channel is now Stasis approved (tm)

	* LICENSE: Clarify language in Asterisk's LICENSE to allow for linking to UniMRCP

	  The UniMRCP project distributes Asterisk modules that integrate Asterisk with

	  Unfortunately, the UniMRCP license is Apache 2.0, which per the Free Software
	  Foundation, is not a compatible license with the GPLv2.

	  "Please note that this license is not compatible with GPL version 2, because it

	  provision is a good thing, which is why we recommend the Apache 2.0 license for
	  substantial programs over other lax permissive licenses."

	  On the other hand, UniMRCP is a great project and we'd like to let people use

	* chan_iax2: Fix Dynamic IAX2 Registrations After Temporary DNS Failure

	  The reporter on the issue found some issues when upgrading from version 10 to 11
	  on 55 hosts.

	  Two situations that can occur with dynamic registrations.

	  1.  With dnsmgr disabled, if the host is not resolvable we are not trying to
	      resolve the host again when it is time to attempt to register again.  This
	      results in never registering to the host.
	  2.  With dnsmgr enabled, when the host is temporarily not resolvable the
	      address is set to 0.0.0.0:0 and then when the host is resolvable the port
	      is not being restored and stays set to 0.

	  This patch resolves these two issues by:

	  * Storing the hostname so that it can be used for resolving with DNS.
	  * Resolve the hostname on the next scheduled attempt to register.
	  * Storing the port used to reach the host so that when the hostname is
	    resolvable again, we can set the port again if the port is still unset after
	    looking up the host.

	  Kick, mute and unmute were a little inconsistent in their handling of channel
	  targets.  This patch cleans that up by insuring they all handle the 'all'

	* Fix race condition in the scheduler when deleting a running entry.

	  When scheduled tasks run, they are removed from the heap (or hashtab).
	  When a scheduled task is deleted, if the task can't be found in the
	  heap (or hashtab), an assertion is triggered. If DO_CRASH is enabled,
	  this assertion causes a crash.

	  The problem is, sometimes it just so happens that someone attempts
	  to delete a scheduled task at the time that it is running, leading
	  to a crash. This change corrects the issue by tracking which task
	  is currently running. If that task is attempted to be deleted,
	  then we mark the task, and then wait for the task to complete.
	  This way, we can be sure to coordinate task deletion and memory
	  freeing.

	* chan_sip: Don't use port derived from fromdomain if it isn't set

	  If a user does not provide a port in the fromdomain setting, chan_sip will set
	  the fromdomainport to STANDARD_SIP_PORT (5060). The fromdomainport value will
	  then get used unilaterally in certain places. This causes issues with TLS,
	  where the default port is expected to be 5061.

	  This patch modifies chan_sip such that fromdomainport is only used if it is
	  not the standard SIP port; otherwise, the port from the SIP pvt's recorded
	  self IP address is used.

	* ARI: Fix implicit answer when playback is initiated on unanswered channel

	  When issuing a POST /channels/{channel_id}/play on a channel that is not
	  yet answered, ARI is supposed to:
	  * Queue up an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS on the channel
	  * Start up the playback of the media

	  Instead, we sneak an answer on the channel right before starting playing media.

	  This is due to ARI's usage of control_streamfile. This function implicitly
	  answers the channel (and doesn't give ARI the option to stop it). The answering
	  of the channel here is probably unnecessary:
	  * app_voicemail, by far the biggest consumer of this function, always answers
	    the channels anyway
	  * control stream file (in res_agi) and ControlPlayback probably shouldn't be
	    implicitly answering the channel. Answering should not be tied directly to
	    playing back media.

	  As it turns out, the answering of the channel here is pretty old:
	  356042    twilson       if (ast_channel_state(chan) != AST_STATE_UP) {
	    3087      anthm               res = ast_answer(chan);
	  180259   tilghman       }

	  (As in, ancient?)

	  Note that others ran into this problem and commented about it on various
	  mailing lists.

	  C answers, B and C can see each other's connected line information

	  I examined the incoming and outgoing party id information handling of
	  chan_pjsip and found several issues:

	  * Fixed ast_sip_session_create_outgoing() not setting up the configured
	  endpoint id as the new channel's caller id.  This is why party A got
	  default connected line information.

	  * Made update_initial_connected_line() use the channel's CALLERID(id)
	  information.  The core, app_dial, or predial routine may have filled in or
	  changed the endpoint caller id information.

	  * Fixed chan_pjsip_new() not setting the full party id information
	  available on the caller id and ANI party id.  This includes the configured
	  callerid_tag string and other party id fields.

	  * Fixed accessing channel party id information without the channel lock
	  held.

	  * Fixed using the effective connected line id without doing a deep copy
	  outside of holding the channel lock.  Shallow copy string pointers can
	  become stale if the channel lock is not held.

	  * Made queue_connected_line_update() also update the channel's
	  CALLERID(id) information.  Moving the channel to another bridge would need
	  the information there for the new bridge peer.

	  * Fixed off nominal memory leak in update_incoming_connected_line().

	  * Added pjsip.conf callerid_tag string to party id information from
	  enabled trust_inbound endpoint in caller_id_incoming_request().

	  as needed.

	* Improve call forwarding reporting, especially with regards to ARI.

	  This patch addresses a few issues:

	  1) The order of Dial events have been changed when performing a call forward.
	     The order has now been altered to
	      1) Dial begins dialing channel A.
	      2) When A forwards the call to B, we issue the dial end event to channel
	         A, indicating the dial is being canceled due to a forward to B.
	      3) When the call to channel B occurs, we then issue a new dial begin to
	         channel B.

	  2) Call forwards are now reported on the calling channel, not the peer channel.

	  3) AMI DialEnd events have been altered to display the extension the call is
	     being forwarded to when relevant.

	  4) You can now get the values of channel variables for channels that are not
	     currently in the Stasis application. This brings the retrieval of channel
	     variables more in line with the rest of channel read operations since they
	     may be performed on channels not in Stasis.

	* apps/app_meetme: Fix crash when publishing MeetMe messages with no channel

	  The same function, meetme_stasis_generate_msg, handles creating and publishing
	  Stasis message both when there are channels in the MeetMe conference and when
	  there are no channels in the conference. When the performance improvement was
	  made to use cached snapshots, this created a situation where Asterisk would
	  crash: obtaining a cached snapshot is not NULL tolerant.

	  This patch restores the previous implementation, which used a NULL safe set
	  of routines to produce a blob containing the channel snapshot (if available)
	  and information about the MeetMe conference.

	* configure: Undefine FORTIFY_SOURCE prior to defining it for patched gcc

	  Some distributions of Linux patch gcc to define FORTIFY_SOURCE when gcc is
	  executed with optimization. This "help" unfortunately results in re-definition
	  warnings when FORTIFY_SOURCE is later defined in Asterisk's build system. This
	  patch undefines FORTIFY_SOURCE prior to defining it to prevent this warning.

	* Bridging: Fix a behavioral change when checking if a channel is leaving a bridge

	  r420934 introduced some failures in the test suite.  Upon investigating, it was
	  discovered that differences in the way we were evaluating whether a channel was in
	  the process of leaving a bridge were causing some reinvites not to occur (mostly
	  reinvites back to Asterisk when ending a call). This patch fixes that behavioral
	  change.

	* app_voicemail/app: Remove test events that were duplicated by r421059

	  Moving the test event raised when a file is played back (which occurred in
	  r421059) broke the ever loving snot out of the voicemail tests. This caused
	  duplicate test events to get raised, as app_voicemail and main/app were raising
	  events prior to call ast_streamfile. The voicemail tests did not enjoy getting
	  multiple events.

	  Since raising the playback event in ast_streamfile is far more useful to the
	  vast majority of tests, this patch keeps the call there and simply removes the
	  extraneous calls that duplicated the event.

	* res/res_hep_rtcp: Remove dependency on PJSIP

	  The res_hep_rtcp module was incorrectly including <pjsip.h>. This didn't need
	  to be included, as the module does not using PJPROJECT any fashion.
	  Unfortunately, because res_hep_rtcp did not include pjsip in its MODULEINFO as
	  a dependency, this also meant that res_hep_rtcp will fail to compile on a
	  system without PJPROJECT.

	  This patch removes the include.

	* cel: Make sure channels in extra fields include their unique IDs as well

	  CEL typically tracks a lot of information using the unique ID of the channel.
	  This is typically needed due to tying events together using the linked ID of
	  the various channels involved in a "call", which is derived from the channel ID
	  of the oldest channel involved in a bridge (or in the case of a Dial, the
	  parent channel).

	  Previously, we had updated the extra fields to include the involved channel
	  names, but forgot to put in the unique ID. This patch corrects that error.

	* Bridges: Fix feature interruption/unintended kick caused by external actions

	  If a manager or CLI user attached a mixmonitor to a call running a dynamic
	  bridge feature while in a bridge, the feature would be interrupted and the
	  channel would be forcibly kicked out of the bridge (usually ending the call
	  during a simple 1 to 1 call). This would also occur during any similar action
	  that could set the unbridge soft hangup flag, so the fix for this was to
	  remove unbridge from the soft hangup flags and make it a separate thing all
	  together.

	* app_queue: Add RealTime support for queue rules

	  This patch gives the optional ability to keep queue rules in RealTime. It is
	  important to note that with this patch:
	   (a) Queue rules in RealTime are only examined on module load/reload
	   (b) Queue rules are loaded both from the queuerules.conf file as well as the
	       RealTime backend
	  To inform app_queue to examine RealTime for queue rules, a new setting has been
	  added to queuerules.conf's general section "realtime_rules". RealTime queue
	  rules will only be used when this setting is set to "yes".

	  The schema for the database table supports a rule_name, time, min_penalty, and
	  max_penalty columns. min_penalty and max_penalty can be relative, if a '-' or
	  '+' literal is provided. Otherwise, the penalties are treated as constants.

	  For example:
	  rule_name, time, min_penalty, max_penalty
	  'default', '10', '20', '30'
	  'test2', '20', '30', '55'
	  'test2', '25', '-11', '+1111'
	  'test2', '400', '112', '333'
	  'test3', '0', '4564', '46546'
	  'test_rule', '40', '15', '50'

	  which would result in :

	  Rule: default
	   - After 10 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 30 and adjust
	     QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 20
	  Rule: test2
	   - After 20 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 55 and adjust
	     QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 30
	   - After 25 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY by 1111 and adjust
	     QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY by -11
	   - After 400 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 333 and adjust
	     QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 112
	  Rule: test3
	   - After 0 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 46546 and adjust
	     QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 4564
	  Rule: test_rule
	   - After 40 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 50 and adjust
	     QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 15

	  If you use RealTime, the queue rules will be always reloaded on a module
	  reload, even if the underlying file did not change. With the option disabled,
	  the rules will only be reloaded if the file was modified.

	* codecs/codec_dahdi.c: codec_dahdi: Cannot use struct
	  ast_translator.core_{src,src}_codec. This fixes a Segmentation
	  fault introduced in r419044 "media formats: re-architect handling
	  of media for performance improvements". The problem is that
	  codec_dahdi was using core_src_codec and core_dst_codec in the
	  ast_translator structure when these fields were never set. Now
	  instead of trying to map the new core codec descriptions to the
	  way DAHDI defines different codecs, we will store the DAHDI
	  specific formats in 'struct translator' directly so we can refer
	  to them without mapping. This also allows us to remove the
	  "global_format_map" structure, since we can now query the list of
	  translators directly to make sure we do not ever register a DAHDI
	  based translator for a specific path more than once and eliminate
	  the need to keep the list and the map in sync. ASTERISK-24435

	* res/res_xmpp.c, main/tcptls.c, /: AST-2014-011: Fix POODLE
	  security issues There are two aspects to the vulnerability: (1)
	  res_jabber/res_xmpp use SSLv3 only. This patch updates the module
	  to use TLSv1+. At this time, it does not refactor
	  res_jabber/res_xmpp to use the TCP/TLS core, which should be done
	  as an improvement at a latter date. (2) The TCP/TLS core, when
	  tlsclientmethod/sslclientmethod is left unspecified, will default
	  to the OpenSSL SSLv23_method. This method allows for all
	  encryption methods, including SSLv2/SSLv3. A MITM can exploit
	  this by forcing a fallback to SSLv3, which leaves the server
	  vulnerable to POODLE. This patch adds WARNINGS if a user uses
	  SSLv2/SSLv3 in their configuration, and explicitly disables
	  SSLv2/SSLv3 if using SSLv23_method. For TLS clients, Asterisk
	  will default to TLSv1+ and WARN if SSLv2 or SSLv3 is explicitly
	  chosen. For TLS servers, Asterisk will no longer support SSLv2 or
	  SSLv3. Much thanks to abelbeck for reporting the vulnerability
	  and providing a patch for the res_jabber/res_xmpp modules.

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Revert 425922
	  This patch for r425922 introduced a bug, wherein sending an
	  INVITE request with no SDP would cause Asterisk to not send an
	  SDP Offer in the 200 OK. The current structure of
	  res_pjsip_sdp_rtp is a bit hard to deal with to fix this, as
	  create_outgoing_sdp has no knowledge of whether or not it is
	  creating an SDP as a new Offer or an Answer. This is something of
	  an oversight in the callback definition, as the caller of it does
	  have this information.

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Remove left over
	  reference to override_prefs The usage of the local override_prefs
	  variable in create_outgoing_sdp_stream was previously to track an
	  override format preference set by PJSIP_MEDIA_OFFER. Now,
	  however, that function simply sets the joint capabilities
	  structure, session->req_caps. During the media format rework, the
	  override_prefs was instead used to check if there were any
	  formats in session->req_caps. However, this usage isn't useful in
	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream. session->req_caps contains the
	  negotiated formats for *all* streams, not just the current one
	  being created. Thus, so long as any stream of any type has
	  provided a format, override_prefs will be non-zero. Hence, its
	  usage in checking whether or not we should look at the formats on
	  the endpoint or the joint capabilities is generally useless.
	  There's only two things useful to check: (1) Does the endpoint
	  have a format for the media type? (2) Did we negotiate a format
	  for the media type? If either of those is a 'no', then we must
	  kill the media stream.

	  Be more tolerant of offers When an inbound SDP offer is received,
	  Asterisk currently makes a few incorrection assumptions: (1) If
	  the offer contains more than a single audio/video stream,
	  Asterisk will reject the entire stream with a 488. This is an
	  overly strict response; generally, Asterisk should accept the
	  media streams that it can accept and decline the others. (2) If
	  the offer contains a declined media stream, Asterisk will attempt
	  to process it anyway. This can result in attempting to match
	  format capabilities on a declined media stream, leading to a 488.
	  Asterisk should simply ignore declined media streams. (3)
	  Asterisk will currently attempt to handle offers with AVPF with
	  use_avpf=No/AVP with use_avpf=Yes. This mismatch results in
	  invalid SDP answers being sent in response. If there is a
	  mismatch between the media type being offered and the
	  configuration, Asterisk must reject the offer with a 488. This
	  patch does the following: * Asterisk will accept SDP offers with
	  at least one media stream that it can use. Some WARNING messages
	  have been dropped to NOTICEs as a result. * Asterisk will not
	  accept an offer with a media type that doesn't match its
	  configuration. * Asterisk will ignore declined media streams

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: channels/chan_sip: Respect outboundproxy

	  unable to send the packet directly to a peer, it is unable to
	  qualify any non-inbound registered peer (e.g. a peer SIP Trunk).

	  information, uses it when sending the OPTIONS request. Review:

	* /, main/stasis_channels.c: stasis_channels.c: Resolve unfinished

	  channels that are involved in a dial operation don't create the
	  expected dial end event. The missing dial end event goes against
	  the model for things like CDRs and generating Dial end manager
	  actions and such. There are four cases: 1) A channel masquerades
	  into the caller channel. The case happens when performing a
	  blonde transfer using the channel driver's protocol. 2) A channel
	  masquerades into a callee channel. The case happens when
	  performing a directed call pickup. 3) The caller channel
	  masquerades out of dial. The case happens when using the Bridge
	  application on the caller channel. 4) A callee channel
	  masquerades out of dial. The case happens when using the Bridge
	  application on a peer channel. As it turned out, all four cases
	  need to be handled instead of just the first one. ASTERISK-24237

	  non-unique category names via AMI This patch provides the
	  capability to manipulate templates and categories with non-unique
	  names via AMI. Summary of changes: GetConfig and GetConfigJSON:
	  Added "Filter" parameter: A comma separated list of
	  name_regex=value_regex expressions which will cause only
	  categories whose variables match all expressions to be
	  considered. The special variable name TEMPLATES can be used to
	  control whether templates are included. Passing 'include' as the
	  value will include templates along with normal categories.
	  Passing 'restrict' as the value will restrict the operation to
	  ONLY templates. Not specifying a TEMPLATES expression results in
	  the current default behavior which is to not include templates.
	  UpdateConfig: NewCat now includes options for allowing duplicate
	  category names, indicating if the category should be created as a
	  template, and specifying templates the category should inherit
	  from. The rest of the actions now accept a filter string as
	  defined above. If there are non-unique category names, you can
	  now update specific ones based on variable values. To facilitate
	  the new capabilities in manager, corresponding changes had to be
	  made to config, most notably the addition of filter criteria to
	  many of the APIs. In some cases it was easy to change the
	  references to use the new prototype but others would have
	  required touching too many files for this patch so a wrapper with
	  the original prototype was created. Macros couldn't be used in
	  this case because it would break binary compatibility with
	  modules such as res_digium_phone that are linked to real symbols.

	  Performing a directed call pickup resulted in a deadlock when
	  PJSIP channels were involved. A masquerade needs to hold onto the
	  channel locks while it swaps channel information between the two
	  channels involved in the masquerade. With PJSIP channels, the
	  fixup routine needed to push a fixup task onto the PJSIP
	  channel's serializer. Unfortunately, if the serializer was also
	  processing a task that needed to lock the channel, you get
	  deadlock. * Added a new control frame that is used to notify the
	  channels that a masquerade is about to start and when it has
	  completed. * Added the ability to query taskprocessors if the
	  current thread is the taskprocessor thread. * Added the ability
	  to suspend/unsuspend the PJSIP serializer thread so a masquerade
	  could fixup the PJSIP channel without using the serializer.

	* tests/test_cel.c, tests/test_cdr.c: Make CDR and CEL unit tests
	  less FRACKy. Prior to this commit, CDR and CEL tests were
	  expected to trigger FRACKs (i.e. assertions) due to the fact that
	  the channels they create have no formats on them. Some code was
	  independently added recently that attempts to prevent FRACKs from
	  occurring by failing early when attempting to set up translation
	  paths if one or both channels support no formats. Unfortunately,
	  this attempt to be helpful made the CDR and CEL tests go from
	  simply FRACKing to outright failing and in some cases, failing so
	  badly as to crash Asterisk. This commit seeks to correct past
	  mistakes by adding the ulaw format to channels created by the CDR
	  and CEL unit tests. This makes setting up translation paths
	  succeed, eliminates previously-seen FRACKs, and ultimately causes
	  the unit tests to succeed again. Review:

	* main/channel.c: main/channel: Unlock channel in off-nominal path
	  In r423414 (13) / r423415 (trunk), an API call that determines if
	  a format capability structure is empty was added. This returns
	  true if the format capability structure is completely empty or
	  "none". A check for this was added in channel.c's set_format
	  call. Unfortunately, when this check was true, it returned from
	  the function while still holding the channel lock. This caused
	  the CDR unit tests - which have a tendency to create channels
	  with no formats - to deadlock. Whoops. This patch unlocks the
	  channel on the off-nominal path.

	* /, main/app.c: Remove undocumented default behavior of
	  ast_play_and_record_full acceptdtmf. ast_play_and_record_full()
	  has a parameter called "acceptdtmf" that is a string of
	  acceptable DTMF digits that may be pressed by a caller to end and
	  accept the recording. ARI uses this function in order to perform
	  recording, and it provides options for what is passed as
	  acceptdtmf to ast_play_and_record_full(). By default, ARI passes
	  an empty string, with the intention that no DTMF can be used to
	  end the recording. The problem is that ast_play_and_record_full()
	  attempts to be "helpful" by setting "#" as the acceptdtmf if an
	  empty string or NULL pointer has been passed in. With ARI, this
	  results in unexpected behavior occurring if you have attempted to
	  intercept "#" yourself in order to perform some other
	  manipulation of the live recording. This change removes the
	  "helpful" behavior by no longer accepting "#" as a default
	  acceptdtmf if none is specified by the caller of
	  ast_play_and_record_full(). This makes the ARI scenario work as
	  expected. The other callers of ast_play_and_record_full() are
	  app_voicemail and app_minivm, and in both cases, they pass an
	  explicit "#" to ast_play_and_record_full() as acceptdtmf, so they
	  are unaffected by this change. ........ Merged revisions 422964

	  apps/app_stack.c: main/cdrs: Preserve context/extension when
	  executing a Macro or GoSub The context/extension in a CDR is
	  generally considered the destination of a call. When looking at a
	  2-party call CDR, users will typically be presented with the
	  following: context exten channel dest_channel app data default
	  1000 SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 However, if the Dial
	  actually takes place in a Macro, the current behaviour in 12 will
	  result in the following CDR: context exten channel dest_channel
	  app data macro-dial s SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 The
	  same is true of a GoSub: context exten channel dest_channel app
	  data subs dial_stuff SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 This
	  generally makes the context/exten fields less than useful. It
	  isn't hard to preserve these values in the CDR state machine;
	  however, we need to have something that informs us when a channel
	  is executing a subroutine. Prior to this patch, there isn't
	  anything that does this. This patch solves this problem by adding
	  a new channel flag, AST_FLAG_SUBROUTINE_EXEC. This flag is set on
	  a channel when it executes a Macro or a GoSub. The CDR engine
	  looks for this value when updating a Party A snapshot; if the
	  flag is present, we don't override the context/exten on the main
	  CDR object. In a funny quirk, executing a hangup handler must
	  *not* abide by this logic, as the endbeforehexten logic assumes
	  that the user wants to see data that occurs in hangup logic,
	  which includes those subroutines. Since those execute outside of
	  a typical Dial operation (and will typically have their own
	  dedicated CDR anyway), this is unlikely to cause any heartburn.

	* main/cdr.c, /: main/cdr: Fix crash/memory consumption in CDRs in
	  multi-party bridge scenarios This patch fixes an issue where CDRs
	  would get stuck generating an infinite number of CDRs, eventually
	  crashing Asterisk (and consuming a lot of memory along the way).
	  When a channel enters into a multi-party bridge, the CDR engine
	  creates mappings of each participant to each other participant,
	  picking the 'A' party as it goes. So, if we have four channels in
	  a multi-party bridge (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Denise), we would have
	  something like: Alice => Bob Alice => Charlie Alice => Denise Bob
	  => Charlie Bob => Denise Charlie => Denise This works fine when
	  participants enter the bridge a single time. When a participant
	  leaves a bridge, the CDRs for that channel are transitioned to a
	  finalized state. The bug occurs if Bob rejoins. When the CDR
	  engine creates mappings between the channels, it walks through
	  all the participants currently in the bridge, and realizes that
	  no one in the bridge can create a CDR with the channel (Bob). As
	  such it creates a new CDR for the candidate and appends it to
	  that candidate's chain. Unfortunately, on this particular code
	  path, it doesn't stop traversing the candidate's chain. Since we
	  just added ourselves to the chain, this causes the loop to keep
	  going, constantly adding new CDRs. This patch makes it so the
	  engine bails when it creates a CDR match in this case. Review:

	  Resolve race condition where channels enter dialplan application
	  before media has been negotiated. Testsuite tests will
	  occasionally fail because on reception of a 200 OK SIP response,
	  an AST_CONTROL_ANSWER frame is queued prior to when media has
	  finished being negotiated. This is because session supplements
	  are called into before PJSIP's inv_session code has told us that
	  media has been updated. Sometimes the queued answer frame is
	  handled by the PBX thread before the ensuing media negotiations
	  occur, causing a test failure. As it turns out, there is another
	  place that session supplements could be called into, which is
	  after media has finished getting negotiated. What this commit
	  introduces is a means for session supplements to indicate when
	  they wish to be called into when handling an incoming SIP
	  response. By default, all session supplements will be run at the
	  same point that they were prior to this commit. However, session
	  supplements may indicate that they wish to be handled earlier
	  than normal on redirects, or they may indicate they wish to be
	  handled after media has been negotiated. In this changeset, two
	  session supplements have been updated to indicate a preference
	  for when they should be run: res_pjsip_diversion executes before
	  handling redirection in order to get information from the
	  Diversion header, and chan_pjsip now handles responses to INVITEs
	  after media negotiation to fix the race condition mentioned

	  actual operations on a bridge themselves should be the same.
	  Currently, this isn't the case with holding bridges. When a
	  channel joins without a role, MoH is started on that channel
	  automatically. Subsequent bridge operations that would stop MoH
	  would fail (as there is no Announcer channel playing MoH to the
	  bridge). Starting MoH on the bridge will also create two MoH
	  streams: one from the MoH being played on the participant
	  channel, and one from the announcer channel. From the perspective
	  of ARI users, this is counter-intuitive - I would not expect MoH
	  to be started for me. The mixing technology determines how media
	  is shared between participants, not the application experience.
	  This patch does the following: * The Stasis bridge class now
	  inspects channels as they are going into a bridge. If the bridge
	  has a holding capability, and the channel has no roles, we give
	  it a participant role and mark the default behaviour to have no
	  entertainment. This allows addChannel operations to continue to
	  set a participant role with an entertainment option if it felt
	  like it (or could do it). * The music on hold channel is now

	* /, channels/chan_iax2.c: chan_iax2: Fix Dynamic IAX2
	  Registrations After Temporary DNS Failure The reporter on the
	  issue found some issues when upgrading from version 10 to 11 on
	  55 hosts. Two situations that can occur with dynamic
	  registrations. 1. With dnsmgr disabled, if the host is not
	  resolvable we are not trying to resolve the host again when it is
	  time to attempt to register again. This results in never
	  registering to the host. 2. With dnsmgr enabled, when the host is
	  temporarily not resolvable the address is set to 0.0.0.0:0 and
	  then when the host is resolvable the port is not being restored
	  and stays set to 0. This patch resolves these two issues by: *
	  Storing the hostname so that it can be used for resolving with
	  DNS. * Resolve the hostname on the next scheduled attempt to
	  register. * Storing the port used to reach the host so that when
	  the hostname is resolvable again, we can set the port again if
	  the port is still unset after looking up the host. ASTERISK-23767

	* main/sched.c, /: Fix race condition in the scheduler when

	  why party A got default connected line information. * Made
	  update_initial_connected_line() use the channel's CALLERID(id)
	  information. The core, app_dial, or predial routine may have
	  filled in or changed the endpoint caller id information. * Fixed
	  chan_pjsip_new() not setting the full party id information
	  available on the caller id and ANI party id. This includes the
	  configured callerid_tag string and other party id fields. * Fixed
	  accessing channel party id information without the channel lock
	  held. * Fixed using the effective connected line id without doing
	  a deep copy outside of holding the channel lock. Shallow copy
	  string pointers can become stale if the channel lock is not held.
	  * Made queue_connected_line_update() also update the channel's
	  CALLERID(id) information. Moving the channel to another bridge
	  would need the information there for the new bridge peer. * Fixed
	  off nominal memory leak in update_incoming_connected_line(). *

	  Stasis: Allow internal channels directly into bridges The patch
	  to catch channels being shoehorned into Stasis() via external
	  mechanisms also happens to catch Announcer and Recorder channels
	  because they aren't known to be stasis-controlled channels in the
	  usual sense. This marks those channels as Stasis()-internal
	  channels and allows them directly into bridges. Review:

	  res/stasis/control.c: Improve call forwarding reporting,
	  especially with regards to ARI. This patch addresses a few
	  issues: 1) The order of Dial events have been changed when
	  performing a call forward. The order has now been altered to 1)
	  Dial begins dialing channel A. 2) When A forwards the call to B,
	  we issue the dial end event to channel A, indicating the dial is
	  being canceled due to a forward to B. 3) When the call to channel
	  B occurs, we then issue a new dial begin to channel B. 2) Call
	  forwards are now reported on the calling channel, not the peer
	  channel. 3) AMI DialEnd events have been altered to display the
	  extension the call is being forwarded to when relevant. 4) You
	  can now get the values of channel variables for channels that are
	  not currently in the Stasis application. This brings the
	  retrieval of channel variables more in line with the rest of
	  channel read operations since they may be performed on channels
	  not in Stasis. ASTERISK-24134 #close Reported by Matt Jordan

	* res/res_pjsip_pubsub.c: Fix crashing unit tests with regards to
	  RLS. The unit tests require a sorcery.conf file that has been set
	  up to store resource lists in memory rather than retrieving from
	  configuration. With a setup that is not conducive to running the
	  tests, a fault in sorcery currently causes Asterisk to crash when
	  attempting to run any of the tests. To get around the crash, this
	  adds a function that verifies the current environment and marks
	  the tests as "not run" if the setup is not correct.

	* res/res_pjsip_pubsub.c: Fix crash encountered by the testsuite.
	  Running testsuite tests locally produced no errors, but when run
	  using the continuous integration framework, crashes occurred. The
	  crashes occurred due to a refcounting error that had been fixed
	  for a similar situation.

	  Remove disabling of modules These modules were originally
	  specified as being disabled, as they were introduced midstream in
	  Asterisk 12. That makes it nicer for folks who are upgrading to a
	  new release in the middle of Asterisk 12. That's not the case for
	  Asterisk 13: it's a brand new release. There's no reason to have
	  the modules disabled by default in that case.

	  (added), configs/samples/queuerules.conf.sample: app_queue: Add
	  RealTime support for queue rules This patch gives the optional
	  ability to keep queue rules in RealTime. It is important to note
	  that with this patch: (a) Queue rules in RealTime are only
	  examined on module load/reload (b) Queue rules are loaded both
	  from the queuerules.conf file as well as the RealTime backend To
	  inform app_queue to examine RealTime for queue rules, a new
	  setting has been added to queuerules.conf's general section
	  "realtime_rules". RealTime queue rules will only be used when
	  this setting is set to "yes". The schema for the database table
	  supports a rule_name, time, min_penalty, and max_penalty columns.
	  min_penalty and max_penalty can be relative, if a '-' or '+'
	  literal is provided. Otherwise, the penalties are treated as
	  constants. For example: rule_name, time, min_penalty, max_penalty
	  'default', '10', '20', '30' 'test2', '20', '30', '55' 'test2',
	  '25', '-11', '+1111' 'test2', '400', '112', '333' 'test3', '0',
	  '4564', '46546' 'test_rule', '40', '15', '50' which would result
	  in : Rule: default - After 10 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY
	  to 30 and adjust QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 20 Rule: test2 - After 20
	  seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 55 and adjust
	  QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 30 - After 25 seconds, adjust
	  QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY by 1111 and adjust QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY by -11 -
	  After 400 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to 333 and adjust

	  Rule: test_rule - After 40 seconds, adjust QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY to
	  50 and adjust QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY to 15 If you use RealTime, the
	  queue rules will be always reloaded on a module reload, even if
	  the underlying file did not change. With the option disabled, the
	  rules will only be reloaded if the file was modified. Review:

	  order/framing members always need to be updated together. * Made
	  iax2_request() setup the channel's native format preference order

	  needs the order specified earler. * Fixed usage of
	  ast_format_compatibility_bitfield2format(). The function can

	  again as they were in Asterisk v1.8. * Renamed prefs to
	  prefs_global so it won't get confused with the local pref

	  handle_cli_iax2_show_peer(). * Fixed ast_cli() calls in
	  handle_cli_iax2_show_peer() to output complete lines. * Changed
	  struct create_addr_info.prefs to be struct iax2_codec_pref as an
	  optimization so iax2_request() and iax2_call() do less work. *
	  Fixed a potential deadlock in ast_iax2_new() on an off-nominal
	  path when the pbx could not get started. * Made set_config()
	  setup a local prefs list along side the local capability format
	  bitfield. Once the config is loaded, then the local copies are
	  put into the global versions. * Fix unininialized codec_buf in

	* main/pbx.c: pbx: Filter out pattern matching hints in responses
	  sent to ExtensionStateList Hints that are a pattern match are
	  technically stored in the hint container in the same fashion as
	  concrete implementations of hints. The pattern matching hints,
	  however, are not "real" in the sense that things can subscribe to
	  them: rather, they are stored in the hints container so that when
	  a subscription is made a "real" hint can be generated for the
	  subscription if one does not yet exist. The extension state core
	  takes care of this correctly by matching against non-pattern
	  matching extensions prior to pattern matching extensions. Because
	  of this, however, the ExtensionStateList AMI action was returning
	  pattern matching hints when executed. These hints are meaningless
	  from the perspective of AMI clients: their state will never
	  change, they cannot be subscribed to, and events would never
	  normally be generated from them. As such, we now filter these out
	  of the response.

	  managerEvent combining for AMI action responses AMI action
	  responses can (and will) reference AMI events that they return.

	  sym export and context clash by pbx_config. ASTERISK-23818 (lua
	  contexts being overwritten by contexts of the same name in
	  pbx_config) surfaced because pbx_lua, having the
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS set, was always force loaded before

	  luasql.mysql need the base Lua language APIs exported
	  (ASTERISK-17279). Back to ASTERISK-23818... It looks like there's
	  an issue in pbx.c where context_merge was only merging includes,
	  switches and ignore patterns if the context was already existing
	  AND has extensions, or if the context was brand new. If pbx_lua
	  is loaded before pbx_config, the context will exist BUT pbx_lua,
	  being implemented as a switch, will never place extensions in it,
	  just the switch statement. The result is that when pbx_config
	  loads, it never merges the switch statement created by pbx_lua
	  into the final context. This patch sets pbx_lua's modflag back to
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS and adds an "else if" in context_merge
	  that catches the case where an existing context has includes,
	  switchs or ingore patterns but no actual extensions.

	  ARI: Add channel technology agnostic out of call text messaging
	  This patch adds the ability to send and receive text messages
	  from various technology stacks in Asterisk through ARI. This
	  includes chan_sip (sip), res_pjsip_messaging (pjsip), and
	  res_xmpp (xmpp). Messages are sent using the endpoints resource,
	  and can be sent directly through that resource, or to a
	  particular endpoint. For example, the following would send the
	  message "Hello there" to PJSIP endpoint alice with a display URI
	  of sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org:
	  ari/endpoints/sendMessage?to=pjsip:alice&from=sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org&body=Hello+There
	  This is equivalent to the following as well:
	  ari/endpoints/PJSIP/alice/sendMessage?from=sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org&body=Hello+There
	  Both forms are available for message technologies that allow for
	  arbitrary destinations, such as chan_sip. Inbound messages can
	  now be received over ARI as well. An ARI application that
	  subscribes to endpoints will receive messages from those
	  endpoints: { "type": "TextMessageReceived", "timestamp":
	  "2014-07-12T22:53:13.494-0500", "endpoint": { "technology":
	  "PJSIP", "resource": "alice", "state": "online", "channel_ids":
	  [] }, "message": { "from": "\"alice\" <sip:alice@127.0.0.1>",
	  "to": "pjsip:asterisk@127.0.0.1", "body": "Watson, come here.",
	  "variables": [] }, "application": "testsuite" } The above was
	  made possible due to some rather major changes in the message
	  core. This includes (but is not limited to): - Users of the
	  message API can now register message handlers. A handler has two
	  callbacks: one to determine if the handler has a destination for
	  the message, and another to handle it. - All dialplan
	  functionality of handling a message was moved into a message
	  handler provided by the message API. - Messages can now have the
	  technology/endpoint associated with them. Various other
	  properties are also now more easily accessible. - A number of ao2
	  containers that weren't really needed were replaced with vectors.
	  Iteration over ao2_containers is expensive and pointless when the
	  lifetime of things is well defined and the number of things is
	  very small. res_stasis now has a new file that makes up its
	  structure, messaging. The messaging functionality implements a
	  message handler, and passes received messages that match an
	  interested endpoint over to the app for processing. Note that
	  inadvertently while testing this, I reproduced ASTERISK-23969.
	  res_pjsip_messaging was incorrectly parsing out the 'to' field,
	  such that arbitrary SIP URIs mangled the endpoint lookup. This
	  patch includes the fix for that as well. Review:

	  module that sends RTCP information to a Homer Server This patch
	  adds a new module to Asterisk, res_hep_rtcp. The module
	  subscribes to the RTCP topics in Stasis and receives RTCP
	  information back from the message bus. It encodes into HEPv3
	  packets and sends the information to the res_hep module for
	  transmission. Using this, someone with a Homer server can get
	  live call quality monitoring for all RTP-based channels in their
	  Asterisk 12+ systems. In addition, there were a few bugs in the
	  RTP engine, res_rtp_asterisk, and chan_pjsip that were uncovered
	  by the tests written for the Asterisk Test Suite. This patch
	  fixes the following: 1) chan_pjsip failed to set its channel
	  unique ids on its RTP instance on outbound calls. It now does
	  this in the appropriate location, in the serialized call
	  callback. 2) The rtp_engine was overflowing some values when
	  packed into JSON. Specifically, some longs and unsigned ints
	  can't be be packed into integer values, for obvious reasons.
	  Since libjansson only supports integers, floats, strings,
	  booleans, and objects, we print these values into strings. 3)
	  res_rtp_asterisk had a few problems: (a) it would emit a source
	  IP address of 0.0.0.0 if bound to that IP address. We now use
	  ast_find_ourip to get a better IP address, and properly marshal
	  the result into an ast_strdupa'd string. (b) Reports can be
	  generated with no report bodies. In particular, this occurs when
	  a sender is transmitting information to a receiver (who will send
	  no RTP back to the sender). As such, the sender has no report
	  body for what it received. We now properly handle this case, and
	  the sender will emit SR reports with no body. Likewise, if we
	  receive an RTCP packet with no report body, we will still
	  generate the appropriate events. ASTERISK-24119 #close ........

	* main/loader.c, res/res_calendar.c: module loader: Unload modules
	  in reverse order of their start order When Asterisk starts a
	  module (calling its load_module function), it re-orders the
	  module list, sorting it alphabetically. Ostensibly, this was done
	  so that the output of 'module show' listed modules in alphabetic
	  order. This had the unfortunate side effect of making modules
	  with complex usage patterns unloadable. A module that has a large
	  number of modules that depend on it is typically abandoned during
	  the unloading process. This results in its memory not being
	  reclaimed during exit. Generally, this isn't harmful - when the
	  process is destroyed, the operating system will reclaim all
	  memory allocated by the process. Prior to Asterisk 12, we also
	  didn't have many modules with complex dependencies. However, with
	  the advent of ARI and PJSIP, this can make make unloading those
	  modules successfully nearly impossible, and thus tracking memory
	  leaks or ref debug leaks a real pain. While this patch is not a
	  complete overhaul of the module loader - such an effort would be
	  beyond the scope of what could be done for Asterisk 13 - this
	  does make some marginal improvements to the loader such that
	  modules like res_pjsip or res_stasis *may* be made properly
	  un-loadable in the future. 1. The linked list of modules has been
	  replaced with a doubly linked list. This allows traversal of the
	  module list to occur backwards. The module shutdown routine now
	  walks the global list backwards when it attempts to unload
	  modules. 2. The alphabetic reorganization of the module list on
	  startup has been removed. Instead, a started module is placed at
	  the end of the module list. 3. The ast_update_module_list
	  function - which is used by the CLI to display the modules - now
	  does the sorting alphabetically itself. It creates its own linked
	  list and inserts the modules into it in alphabetic order. This
	  allows for the intent of the previous code to be maintained. This
	  patch also contains a fix for res_calendar. Without
	  calendar.conf, the calendar modules were improperly bumping the
	  use count of res_calendar, then failing to load themselves. This
	  patch makes it so that we detect whether or not calendaring is
	  enabled before altering the use count. Review:

	  race condition between channels leaving/joining. Bridges created

	  main/channel.c, main/dial.c, main/pbx.c: accountcode: Slightly
	  change accountcode propagation. The previous behavior was to
	  simply set the accountcode of an outgoing channel to the
	  accountcode of the channel initiating the call. It was done this
	  way a long time ago to allow the accountcode set on the SIP/100
	  channel to be propagated to a local channel so the dialplan
	  execution on the Local;2 channel would have the SIP/100
	  accountcode available. SIP/100 -> Local;1/Local;2 -> SIP/200
	  Propagating the SIP/100 accountcode to the local channels is very
	  useful. Without any dialplan manipulation, all channels in this
	  call would have the same accountcode. Using dialplan, you can set
	  a different accountcode on the SIP/200 channel either by setting
	  the accountcode on the Local;2 channel or by the Dial
	  application's b(pre-dial), M(macro) or U(gosub) options, or by
	  the FollowMe application's b(pre-dial) option, or by the Queue
	  application's macro or gosub options. Before Asterisk v12, the
	  altered accountcode on SIP/200 will remain until the local
	  channels optimize out and the accountcode would change to the
	  SIP/100 accountcode. Asterisk v1.8 attempted to add peeraccount
	  support but ultimately had to punt on the support. The
	  peeraccount support was rendered useless because of how the CDR
	  code needed to unconditionally force the caller's accountcode
	  onto the peer channel's accountcode. The CEL events were thus
	  intentionally made to always use the channel's accountcode as the
	  peeraccount value. With the arrival of Asterisk v12, the
	  situation has improved somewhat so peeraccount support can be
	  made to work. Using the indicated example, the the accountcode
	  values become as follows when the peeraccount is set on SIP/100
	  before calling SIP/200: SIP/100 ---> Local;1 ---- Local;2 --->
	  SIP/200 acct: 100 \/ acct: 200 \/ acct: 100 \/ acct: 200 peer:
	  200 /\ peer: 100 /\ peer: 200 /\ peer: 100 If a channel already
	  has an accountcode it can only change by the following explicit
	  user actions: 1) A channel originate method that can specify an
	  accountcode to use. 2) The calling channel propagating its
	  non-empty peeraccount or its non-empty accountcode if the
	  peeraccount was empty to the outgoing channel's accountcode
	  before initiating the dial. e.g., Dial and FollowMe. The
	  exception to this propagation method is Queue. Queue will only
	  propagate peeraccounts this way only if the outgoing channel does
	  not have an accountcode. 3) Dialplan using CHANNEL(accountcode).
	  4) Dialplan using CHANNEL(peeraccount) on the other end of a
	  local channel pair. If a channel does not have an accountcode it
	  can get one from the following places: 1) The channel driver's
	  configuration at channel creation. 2) Explicit user action as
	  already indicated. 3) Entering a basic or stasis-mixing bridge
	  from a peer channel's peeraccount value. You can specify the
	  accountcode for an outgoing channel by setting the
	  CHANNEL(peeraccount) before using the Dial, FollowMe, and Queue
	  applications. Queue adds the wrinkle that it will not overwrite
	  an existing accountcode on the outgoing channel with the calling
	  channels values. Accountcode and peeraccount values propagate to
	  an outgoing channel before dialing. Accountcodes also propagate
	  when channels enter or leave a basic or stasis-mixing bridge. The
	  peeraccount value only makes sense for mixing bridges with two
	  channels; it is meaningless otherwise. * Made peeraccount
	  functional by changing accountcode propagation as described
	  above. * Fixed CEL extracting the wrong ie value for the
	  peeraccount. This was done intentionally in Asterisk v1.8 when
	  that version had to punt on peeraccount. * Fixed a few places
	  dealing with accountcodes that were reading from channels without
	  the lock held. AFS-65 #close Review:

	* main/devicestate.c, channels/chan_pjsip.c: device state: Update
	  the core to report ONHOLD if a channel is on hold In Asterisk, it
	  is possible for a device to have a status of ONHOLD. This is not
	  typically an easy thing to determine, as a channel being on hold
	  is not a direct channel state. Typically, this has to be
	  calculated outside of the core independently in channel drivers,
	  notably, chan_sip and chan_pjsip. Both of these channel drivers
	  already have to calculate device state in a fashion more complex
	  than the core can handle, as they aggregate all state of all
	  channels associated with a peer/endpoint; they also independently
	  track whether or not one of those channels is currently on hold
	  and mark the device state appropriately. In 12+, we now have the
	  ability to report an AST_DEVICE_ONHOLD state for all channels
	  that defer their device state to the core. This is due to channel
	  hold state actually now being tracked on the channel itself. If a
	  channel driver defers its device state to the core (which many,
	  such as DAHDI, IAX2, and others do in most situations), the
	  device state core already goes out to get a channel associated
	  with the device. As such, it can now also factor the channel hold
	  state in its calculation. This patch adds this logic to the
	  device state core. It also uses an existing mapping between
	  device state and channel state to handle more channel states.
	  chan_pjsip has been updated slightly as well to make use of this
	  (as it was, for some reason, reporting a channel state of BUSY as
	  a device state of INUSE, which feels slightly wrong). Review:

	  (2) It serves as the preliminary work needed for ASTERISK-23692,
	  which allows for sending/receiving arbitrary out of call text
	  messages through ARI in a technology agnostic fashion. The
	  messaging functionality described on ASTERISK-23692 requires two
	  things: (1) The ability to send/receive messages associated with
	  an endpoint. This is relatively straight forwards with the
	  endpoint core in Asterisk now. (2) The ability to send/receive
	  messages associated with a technology and an arbitrary technology
	  defined URI. This is less straight forward, as endpoints are
	  formed from a tech + resource pair. We don't have a mechanism to
	  note that a technology that *may* have endpoints exists. This
	  patch provides such a mechanism, and fixes a few bugs along the
	  way. The first major bug this patch fixes is the forwarding of
	  channel messages to their respective endpoints. Prior to this
	  patch, there were two problems: (1) Channel caching messages
	  weren't forwarded. Thus, the endpoints missed most of the
	  interesting bits (such as channel creation, destruction, state
	  changes, etc.) (2) Channels weren't associated with their
	  endpoint until after creation. This resulted in endpoints missing
	  the channel creation message, which limited the usefulness of the
	  subscription in the first place (a major use case being 'tell me
	  when this endpoint has a channel'). Unfortunately, this meant
	  another parameter to ast_channel_alloc. Since not all channel
	  technologies support an ast_endpoint, this patch makes such a
	  call optional and opts for a new function,
	  ast_channel_alloc_with_endpoint. When endpoints are created, they
	  will implicitly create a technology endpoint for their technology
	  (if one does not already exist). A technology endpoint is special
	  in that it has no state, cannot have channels created for it,
	  cannot be created explicitly, and cannot be destroyed except on
	  shutdown. It does, however, have all messages from other
	  endpoints in its technology forwarded to it. Combined with the
	  bug fixes, we now have Stasis messages being properly forwarded.
	  Consider the following scenario: two PJSIP endpoints (foo and
	  bar), where bar has a single channel associated with it and foo
	  has two channels associated with it. The messages would be
	  forwarded as follows: channel PJSIP/foo-1 -- \ --> endpoint
	  PJSIP/foo -- / \ channel PJSIP/foo-2 -- \ ---- > endpoint PJSIP /
	  channel PJSIP/bar-1 -----> endpoint PJSIP/bar -- ARI, through the
	  applications resource, can: - subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP/foo and
	  get notifications for channels PJSIP/foo-1,PJSIP/foo-2 and
	  endpoint PJSIP/foo - subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP/bar and get
	  notifications for channels PJSIP/bar-1 and endpoint PJSIP/bar -
	  subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP and get notifications for channels
	  PJSIP/foo-1,PJSIP/foo-2,PJSIP/bar-1 and endpoints
	  PJSIP/foo,PJSIP/bar Note that since endpoint PJSIP never changes,
	  it never has events itself. It merely provides an aggregation
	  point for all other endpoints in its technology (which in turn
	  aggregate all channel messages associated with that endpoint).
	  This patch also adds endpoints to res_xmpp and chan_motif,
	  because the actual messaging work will need it (messaging without
	  XMPP is just sad). Review:

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: chan_iax2: Restore previous behavior of
	  iax2_best_codec. The iax2_best_codec function was changed to
	  convert the formats into a format compatibilities structure and
	  grab the first format from it. The resulting order differs from
	  the previous order of iax2_best_codec which causes unexpected
	  formats to get chosen (such as g723). This commit brings back the
	  old behavior of iax2_best_codec by having a specified preference
	  list. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3835/

	  from media formats branch After merging the media formats branch,

	  handling of media for performance improvements In the old times
	  media formats were represented using a bit field. This was fast
	  but had a few limitations. 1. Asterisk was limited in how many
	  formats it could handle. 2. Formats, being a bit field, could not
	  include any attribute information. A format was strictly its
	  type, e.g., "this is ulaw". This was changed in Asterisk 10 (see
	  https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Media+Architecture+Proposal
	  for notes on that work) which led to the creation of the
	  ast_format structure. This structure allowed Asterisk to handle
	  attributes and bundle information with a format. Additionally,
	  ast_format_cap was created to act as a container for multiple
	  formats that, together, formed the capability of some entity.
	  Another mechanism was added to allow logic to be registered which
	  performed format attribute negotiation. Everywhere throughout the
	  codebase Asterisk was changed to use this strategy.
	  Unfortunately, in software, there is no free lunch. These new
	  capabilities came at a cost. Performance analysis and profiling
	  showed that we spend an inordinate amount of time comparing,
	  copying, and generally manipulating formats and their related
	  structures. Basic prototyping has shown that a reasonably large
	  performance improvement could be made in this area. This patch is
	  the result of that project, which overhauled the media format
	  architecture and its usage in Asterisk to improve performance.
	  Generally, the new philosophy for handling formats is as follows:
	  * The ast_format structure is reference counted. This removed a
	  large amount of the memory allocations and copying that was done
	  in prior versions. * In order to prevent race conditions while
	  keeping things performant, the ast_format structure is immutable
	  by convention and lock-free. Violate this tenet at your peril! *
	  Because formats are reference counted, codecs are also reference
	  counted. The Asterisk core generally provides built-in codecs and
	  caches the ast_format structures created to represent them.
	  Generally, to prevent inordinate amounts of module reference
	  bumping, codecs and formats can be added at run-time but cannot
	  be removed. * All compatibility with the bit field representation
	  of codecs/formats has been moved to a compatibility API. The
	  primary user of this representation is chan_iax2, which must
	  continue to maintain its bit-field usage of formats for
	  interoperability concerns. * When a format is negotiated with
	  attributes, or when a format cannot be represented by one of the
	  cached formats, a new format object is created or cloned from an
	  existing format. That format may have the same codec underlying
	  it, but is a different format than a version of the format with
	  different attributes or without attributes. * While formats are
	  reference counted objects, the reference count maintained on the
	  format should be manipulated with care. Formats are generally
	  cached and will persist for the lifetime of Asterisk and do not
	  explicitly need to have their lifetime modified. An exception to
	  this is when the user of a format does not know where the format
	  came from *and* the user may outlive the provider of the format.
	  This occurs, for example, when a format is read from a channel:
	  the channel may have a format with attributes (hence, non-cached)
	  and the user of the format may last longer than the channel (if
	  the reference to the channel is released prior to the format's
	  reference). For more information on this work, see the API design
	  notes:
	  https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Media+Format+Rewrite
	  Finally, this work was the culmination of a large number of
	  developer's efforts. Extra thanks goes to Corey Farrell, who took
	  on a large amount of the work in the Asterisk core, chan_sip, and
	  was an invaluable resource in peer reviews throughout this
	  project. There were a substantial number of patches contributed
	  during this work; the following issues/patch names simply reflect
	  some of the work (and will cause the release scripts to give
	  attribution to the individuals who work on them). Reviews:

	* channels/chan_sip.c, UPGRADE.txt: chan_sip: Make
	  progressinband=never really mean 'never' progressinband=never in
	  sip.conf is easily defeated if an onward trunk sends a progress
	  indication of its own. This is almost certain to happen if the
	  onward trunk is ISDN or IAX as these technologies send a progress
	  indication even if early media is not required. This progress
	  message is passed to the caller, and causes the "never" option to
	  be rather badly named. This patch changes the behaviour of this
	  setting in the following ways: 1) In sip_write(), do not pass the
	  media unless we have either progressed beyond INV_EARLY_MEDIA, or
	  we are in INV_EARLY_MEDIA state, and early media is both set-up
	  and wanted. This helps resolve double-ringing on some buggy
	  handsets. 2) In sip_indicate(), if we see AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS,
	  but SIP_PROG_INBAND_NEVER is set, send a 180 Ringing instead to
	  avoid implicitly enabling early media. Avoid sending double ring
	  indications. NOTE: the meaning of the SIP_PROGRESS_SENT flag
	  changes slightly in this patch to also encapsulate the fact that
	  a channel has *sent or received* a 183 Progress indication. This
	  makes the updated code in sip_write() much more simple. Review:

	  svn:externals property. This is being done for two reasons: (1)
	  The removal of external repositories eases a future migration to
	  git (2) Asterisk is now the only thing that uses menuselect; as a
	  result, there's little need to keep it in an external repository
	  Subsequent patches will remove the mxml dependency from
	  menuselect and tidy up the build system. ASTERISK-20703

	  res/res_stasis.c, /, res/stasis/app.c: ARI/res_stasis: Subscribe
	  to both Local channel halves when originating to app This patch
	  fixes two bugs: 1. When originating a channel into a Stasis
	  application, we already create a subscription for the channel
	  that is going into our Stasis app. Unfortunately, when you create
	  a Local channel and pass it off to a Stasis app, you really
	  aren't creating just one channel: you're creating two. This patch
	  snags the second half of the Local channel pair (assuming it is a
	  Local channel pair, but luckily core_local is kind about such
	  assumptions) and subscribes to it as well. 2. Subscriptions are a
	  bit sticky right now. If a subscription is made, the 'interest'
	  count gets bumped on the Stasis subscription - but unless
	  something explicitly unsubscribes the channel, said subscription
	  sticks around. This is not much of a problem is a user is
	  creating the subscription - if they made it, they must want it.
	  However, when we are creating implicit subscriptions, we need to
	  make sure something clears them out. This patch takes a
	  pessimistic approach: it watches the cache updates coming from
	  Stasis and, if we notice that the cache just cleared out an
	  object, we delete our subscription object. This keeps our ao2
	  container of Stasis forwards in an application from growing out
	  of hand; it also is a bit more forgiving for end users who may
	  not realize they were supposed to unsubscribe from that channel
	  that just hung up. Review:

	  to inject custom values into the dialstatus provided by
	  ast_channel_dial_type() Stasis messages that fall outside the
	  enumeration allowed for the DIALSTATUS channel variable. CEL now

	  is never set for the pjsip channel driver. This change sets the

	  menuselect-deps The previous patch (r418034) fixed the 'glitch'

	  worked. This patch fixes *that* glitch, and removes some more of
	  the vestiges of h323. (It had tendrils in the main Makefile?
	  Crazy.)

	* configure.ac, configure: configure: Update script to pass if

	  Billing records are fair, To get paid is quite bright, You should

	  H.323, Hell, we all remember NetMeeting. But try to compile
	  chan_h323 now And you will take quite a beating. The XMPP and SIP
	  war was fierce, And in the distant fray Was birthed
	  res_jabber/chan_jingle; But neither to stay. For everyone did
	  care and chase what Google professed. "Free Internet Calling" was
	  what devotees cried, But Google did change the specs so often
	  That the developers were happy the day chan_gtalk died. And then
	  there was that odd application Dedicated to the Polish tongue.
	  app_saycountpl was subsumed by Say; One could say its bell was
	  rung. To read and parse a file from the dialplan You could (I
	  guess) use an application. app_readfile did fill that purpose,
	  but I think A function is perhaps better in its creation. Barging
	  is rude, I'm not sure why we do it. Inwardly, the caller will
	  probably sigh. But if you really must do it, Don't use
	  app_dahdibarge, use ChanSpy. We all despise the sound of tinny
	  robots It makes our queues so cold. To control such an
	  abomination It's better to not use Wait/SetMusicOnHold. It's
	  often nice to know properties of a channel It makes our calls
	  right We have a nice function called CHANNEL And so SIPCHANINFO
	  is sent off into the night. And now things get odd; Apparently
	  one could delimit with a colon Properties from the SIPPEER
	  function! Commas are in; all others are done. Finally, a word on
	  pipes and commas. We're sorry. We can't say it enough. But those
	  compatibility options in asterisk.conf; To maintain them forever
	  was just too tough. This patch removes: * cdr_sqlite * chan_gtalk
	  * chan_jingle * chan_h323 * res_jabber * app_saycountpl *
	  app_readfile * app_dahdibarge It removes the following
	  applications/functions: * WaitMusicOnHold * SetMusicOnHold *
	  SIPCHANINFO It removes the colon delimiter from the SIPPEER
	  function. Finally, it also removes all compatibility options that
	  were configurable from asterisk.conf, as these all applied to
	  compatibility with Asterisk 1.4 systems. Review:

	  channels/sig_pri.c: chan_dahdi: Add inband_on_setup_ack
	  compatibility option. The new inband_on_setup_ack option causes
	  Asterisk to assume inband audio may be present when a
	  SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message is received. Q.931 Section 5.1.3 says
	  that in scenarios with overlap dialing, when a dialtone is sent
	  from the network side, progress indicator 8 "Inband info now
	  available" MAY be sent to the CPE if no digits were received with
	  the SETUP. It is thus implied that the ie is mandatory if digits
	  came with the SETUP and dialtone is needed. This option should be
	  enabled, when the network sends dialtone and you want to hear it,
	  but the network doesn't send the progress indicator when needed.
	  NOTE: For Q.SIG setups this option should be enabled when
	  outgoing overlap dialing is also enabled because Q.SIG does not
	  send the progress indicator with the SETUP ACK. The commit
	  -r413714 (AST-1338) which causes this issue was dealing with a
	  SIP-to-ISDN interoperability issue. This commit is a merge of the
	  two patches indicated below. ASTERISK-23897 #close Reported by:

	* main/tcptls.c, CHANGES: main/tcptls: Add support for Perfect
	  Forward Secrecy This patch enables Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
	  in Asterisk's core TLS API. Modules that wish to enable PFS
	  should consider the following: - Ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE) is
	  enabled by default. To disable it, do not specify a ECDHE cipher
	  suite in a module's configuration, for example:
	  tlscipher=AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA - Ephemeral DH (DHE) is
	  disabled by default. To enable it, add DH parameters into the
	  private key file, i.e., tlsprivatekey. For an example, see the
	  default dh2048.pem at
	  http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/OpenSSL098/OpenSSL098-35.1/src/apps/dh2048.pem?txt
	  - Because clients expect the server to prefer PFS, and because
	  OpenSSL sorts its cipher suites by bit strength, (see "openssl
	  ciphers -v DEFAULT") consider re-ordering your cipher suites in
	  the conf file. For example:
	  tlscipher=AES128+kEECDH:AES128+kEDH:3DES+kEDH:AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:-ADH:-AECDH
	  will use PFS when offered by the client. Clients which do not
	  offer PFS fall-back to AES-128 (or even 3DES as recommend by RFC
	  3261). Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3647/

	  for this. This was not removed in the updated RFC 4867 in 2007.

	* CHANGES, apps/app_jack.c: app_jack: Support audio with a sampling

	  cope with dynamic sampling rates from and to Asterisk.
	  Information from the channel is taken to derive the channel's
	  sampling rate, suiting SLINxx format and frame->datalen. There
	  are stil a few limitations after this patch: * Required
	  information is taken from the channel during initialization as
	  the audiohook does not provide this information.
	  Audiohook.internal_sampl_rate(...) is set later, but no callback
	  is available to inform app_jack. * Frame.datalen is computed
	  using "rate / 50" assuming a ptime of 20ms. There is no internal
	  API available to determine datalen for a SLINxx. * Ringbuffer
	  size is now dynamic depending on the value of frame.datalen (see
	  above) and the number of frames, which are in
	  RINGBUFFER_FRAME_CAPACITY, that need to fit. Review:

	  channels/chan_sip.c, UPGRADE.txt: res_http_websocket: Close
	  websocket correctly and use careful fwrite When a client takes a
	  long time to process information received from Asterisk, a write
	  operation using fwrite may fail to write all information. This
	  causes the underlying file stream to be in an unknown state, such
	  that the socket must be disconnected. Unfortunately, there are
	  two problems with this in Asterisk's existing websocket code: 1.
	  Periodically, during the read loop, Asterisk must write to the
	  connected websocket to respond to pings. As such, Asterisk
	  maintains a reference to the session during the loop. When
	  ast_http_websocket_write fails, it may cause the session to
	  decrement its ref count, but this in and of itself does not break
	  the read loop. The read loop's write, on the other hand, does not
	  break the loop if it fails. This causes the socket to get in a
	  'stuck' state, preventing the client from reconnecting to the
	  server. 2. More importantly, however, is that the fwrite in
	  ast_http_websocket_write fails with a large volume of data when
	  the client takes awhile to process the information. When it does
	  fail, it fails writing only a portion of the bytes. With some
	  debugging, it was shown that this was failing in a similar
	  fashion to ASTERISK-12767. Switching this over to
	  ast_careful_fwrite with a long enough timeout solved the problem.
	  Note that this version of the patch, unlike r417310 in Asterisk
	  11, exposes configuration options beyond just chan_sip's
	  sip.conf. Configuration options to configure the write timeout
	  have also been added to pjsip.conf and ari.conf. #ASTERISK-23917

	* channels/sig_pri.c, channels/sig_pri.h, channels/chan_dahdi.c:
	  suspended destructions of pri spans on events If a DAHDI span
	  disappears, we wish for its representation in Asterisk to be
	  destroyed as well. The information about the span's removal may
	  come from several paths: 1. DAHDI sends DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVE on
	  every channel. 2. An extra DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVED is sent on every
	  subsequent call to DAHDI_GET_EVENT. 3. Every read (including the
	  internal one by libpri on the D-channel) returns -ENODEV.
	  Asterisk responsds to DAHDI_EVENT_REMOVE on a channel by
	  destroying it. Destroying a channel requires holding the channel
	  list lock (iflock). Destroying a channel that is part of a span
	  requires holding the span's lock. Destroying a channel from a
	  context that holds the span lock, while at the same time another
	  channel is destroyed directly, leads to a deadlock. Solution:
	  don't destroy span while holding the channels list lock. Thus
	  changes in this patch: * Deferring removal of PRI spans in
	  response to events: doomed spans are collected on a list. *
	  Doomed spans are removed periodically by the monitor thread. *
	  ENODEV reads from the D-channel will warant the same deferred
	  removal. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3548/

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: channels/chan_sip: Forbid remote bridging
	  if T.38 is negotiated When a framehook is removed - such as the
	  fax gateway framehook - the bridge framework will re-evaluate the
	  bridge mixing technologies to see if it can improve the bridging.
	  When this occurs, get_rtp_info will be called to determine if
	  local or remote bridging can be used. Using remote bridging will
	  cause a fax to fail, as direct media negotiation will cause some
	  small number of packets to not arrive at the remote endpoint.
	  This patch forces local native bridging if T.38 negotiation is in
	  progress or has been established. ........ Merged revisions

	  published *quite* as much as they used to. One instance where
	  they are not published any longer is during bridge enter and exit
	  - the state of the channel doesn't change, the bridge does.
	  However, channels are changed when a linkedid is propagated;
	  previously, the channel's state would be updated and published
	  during the bridge enter event. Now this must be explicitly done.

	  channel snapshots to improve performance During some performance
	  testing of Asterisk with AGI, ARI, and lots of Local channels, we
	  noticed that there's quite a hit in performance during channel
	  creation and releasing to the dialplan (ARI continue). After
	  investigating the performance spike that occurs during channel
	  creation, we discovered that we create a lot of channel snapshots
	  that are technically unnecessary. This includes creating
	  snapshots during: * AGI execution * Returning objects for ARI
	  commands * During some Local channel operations * During some
	  dialling operations * During variable setting * During some
	  bridging operations And more. This patch does the following: - It
	  removes a number of fields from channel snapshots. These fields
	  were rarely used, were expensive to have on the snapshot, and
	  hurt performance. This included formats, translation paths, Log
	  Call ID, callgroup, pickup group, and all channel variables. As a
	  result, AMI Status, "core show channel", "core show channelvar",
	  and "pjsip show channel" were modified to either hit the live
	  channel or not show certain pieces of data. While this is
	  unfortunate, the performance gain from this patch is worth the
	  loss in behaviour. - It adds a mechanism to publish a cached
	  snapshot + blob. A large number of publications were changed to
	  use this, including: - During Dial begin - During Variable
	  assignment (if no AMI variables are emitted - if AMI variables
	  are set, we have to make snapshots when a variable is changed) -
	  During channel pickup - When a channel is put on hold/unhold -
	  When a DTMF digit is begun/ended - When creating a bridge
	  snapshot - When an AOC event is raised - During Local channel
	  optimization/Local bridging - When endpoint snapshots are
	  generated - All AGI events - All ARI responses that return a
	  channel - Events in the AgentPool, MeetMe, and some in Queue -
	  Additionally, some extraneous channel snapshots were being made
	  that were unnecessary. These were removed. - The result of
	  ast_hashtab_hash_string is now cached in stasis_cache. This
	  reduces a large number of calls to ast_hashtab_hash_string, which
	  reduced the amount of time spent in this function in gprof by
	  around 50%. #ASTERISK-23811 #close Reported by: Matt Jordan

	* res/res_musiconhold.c, /: MoH: Don't restart stream on repeated
	  start calls Currently, music on hold will stop and then start
	  again from the beginning if ast_moh_start() is called multiple
	  times. This can happen if a call is put on hold repeatedly (the
	  channel receives multiple HOLD control frames) and can be
	  triggered from ARI by starting MoH on a channel multiple times.
	  This is fairly jarring/annoying to users. This change prevents
	  MoH from being restarted if the requested music class is the same

	  number of allowed HTTP connections. Simply establishing a TCP
	  connection and never sending anything to the configured HTTP port
	  in http.conf will tie up a HTTP connection. Since there is a
	  maximum number of open HTTP sessions allowed at a time you can
	  block legitimate connections. A similar problem exists if a HTTP
	  request is started but never finished. * Added http.conf
	  session_inactivity timer option to close HTTP connections that
	  aren't doing anything. Defaults to 30000 ms. * Removed the
	  undocumented manager.conf block-sockets option. It interferes
	  with TCP/TLS inactivity timeouts. * AMI and SIP TLS connections
	  now have better authentication timeout protection. Though I
	  didn't remove the bizzare TLS timeout polling code from chan_sip.
	  * chan_sip can now handle SSL certificate renegotiations in the
	  middle of a session. It couldn't do that before because the
	  socket was non-blocking and the SSL calls were not restarted as
	  documented by the OpenSSL documentation. * Fixed an off nominal
	  leak of the ssl struct in handle_tcptls_connection() if the FILE
	  stream failed to open and the SSL certificate negotiations
	  failed. The patch creates a custom FILE stream handler to give
	  the created FILE streams inactivity timeout and timeout after a
	  specific moment in time capability. This approach eliminates the
	  need for code using the FILE stream to be redesigned to deal with
	  the timeouts. This patch indirectly fixes most of ASTERISK-18345
	  by fixing the usage of the SSL_read/SSL_write operations.

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: delayed state can cause early
	  leavewhenempty ringing In app_queue, device state changes arrive
	  in event messages and update the queue member status value. That
	  value is checked in get_member_status() to decide that the caller
	  should leave when there are no available members. Although event
	  messages can be delayed by other activity, there is no adverse
	  affect by lagged status except in one specific case: there is
	  only one available member, it was just rung, and leavewhenempty
	  is enabled set for ringing members. This change adds a direct
	  check of the device state only under this condition where the
	  caller may be dropped incorrectly, resolving this issue without
	  affecting performance of app_queue normally. AST-1248 #close

	* res/res_pjsip.c, /: Fix potential deadlock situation in
	  res_pjsip. SIP transaction timeouts are handled in the PJSIP
	  monitor thread. When this happens on a subscription, and the
	  subscription is destroyed, the subscription destruction is
	  dispatched synchronously to the threadpool. The issue is that the
	  PJSIP dialog is locked by the monitor thread, and then the
	  dispatched task attempts to lock the dialog. This leads to a
	  deadlock that causes SIP traffic to no longer be accepted on the
	  Asterisk server. The fix here is to treat the monitor thread as
	  if it were a threadpool thread when it attempts to dispatch
	  synchronous tasks. This way, the dispatched task turns into a
	  simple function call within the same thread, and the locking
	  issue is averted. AST-2014-008 ASTERISK-23802 #close ........

	  of r414122. When r414122 was merged, a major problem with it was
	  uncovered. UNBRIDGE soft hangup flags have a catastrophic effect
	  on the pbx core if they leak out from the bridge layer: the
	  channel gets hung up. With the number of threads involved in a
	  blind transfer, and with the initial patch, it was likely that
	  this would occur. This caused a large number of test failures
	  This patch is nearly identical with the one proposed in r414122,
	  save for the following changes: - We explicitly clear the
	  UNBRIDGE flag when setting an after goto on a channel in a bridge
	  - Defensively, if we encounter an UNBRIDGE flag in the pbx core,
	  we handle it https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3585/ ........

	  that can cause the channel to get no audio with scrolling
	  warnings about format mismatches. This is caused by a failure to

	  the translation paths to be setup correctly and the raw read and

	* main/config.c, /: config: Fix config files not reloading when
	  only an included file changes. The twisted logic determining if a
	  config file should be reloaded was mostly broken and disabled.
	  The incorrect test that ASTERISK-23383 fixed actually reenabled
	  the broken logic. The incorrect test was causing the timestamp to
	  always be cleared which caused config files with includes to
	  always be reloaded. * Made wildcard includes always cause a
	  reload. Determining if a file was deleted cannot be determined
	  without restructuring the cache to determine if any files are
	  missing from the last files actually loaded. Also without
	  refactoring config_text_file_load(), the glob loop couldn't check
	  more than one file for changes anyway. * Made remove the cache
	  entry if the file no longer exists when trying to get its
	  timestamp or it is no longer a regular file. This fixes the
	  corner case where the file was loaded, then deleted, then the
	  config reloaded, then the file restored with the same timestamp,
	  and then the config reloaded again. * Made remove the cache entry
	  include list when actually loading the file. This gets rid of any
	  stale includes the file had from the last time the file was

	  potentially be useful for future work (for instance this could
	  allow ARI to connect back to some external system, although more

	  of things to note - proxy connection support has not been
	  implemented and there is limited http response code handling
	  (basically, it is connect or not). Also added an initial new URI
	  handling mechanism to core. Internet type URI's are parsed into a
	  data structure that contains pointers to the various parts of the
	  URI. (closes issue ASTERISK-23742) Reported by: Kevin Harwell

	  reduce chatty verbose messages This patch addresses some
	  aesthetic issues in Asterisk. These are all just minor tweaks to
	  improve the look of the CLI when used in a variety of settings.
	  Specifically: * A number of chatty verbose messages were removed
	  or demoted to DEBUG messages. Verbose messages with a verbosity
	  level of 5 or higher were - if kept as verbose messages - demoted
	  to level 4. Several messages that were emitted at verbose level 3
	  were demoted to 4, as announcement of dialplan applications being
	  executed occur at level 3 (and so the effects of those
	  applications should generally be less). * Some verbose messages
	  that only appear when their respective 'debug' options are
	  enabled were bumped up to always be displayed. *
	  Prefix/timestamping of verbose messages were moved to the
	  verboser handlers. This was done to prevent duplication of
	  prefixes when the timestamp option (-T) is used with the CLI. *
	  Verbose magic is removed from messages before being emitted to
	  non-verboser handlers. This prevents the magic in multi-line
	  verbose messages (such as SIP debug traces or the output of
	  DumpChan) from being written to files. * _Slightly_ better
	  support for the "light background" option (-W) was added. This
	  includes using ast_term_quit in the output of XML documentation
	  help, as well as changing the "Asterisk Ready" prompt to bright
	  green on the default background (which stands a better chance of
	  being displayed properly than bright white). Review:

	* /, main/core_unreal.c: core_unreal: Prevent double free of
	  core_unreal pvt When a channel is destroyed (such as via
	  ast_channel_release in off nominal paths in core_unreal), it will
	  attempt to free (via ast_free) the channel tech pvt. This is
	  problematic for a few reasons: 1. The channel tech pvt is an ao2
	  object in core_unreal. Free'ing the pvt directly is no good. 2.
	  The channel tech pvt's reference count is dropped just prior to
	  calling ast_channel_release, resulting in the pvt's destruction.
	  Hence, the channel destructor is free'ing an invalid pointer.
	  This patch keeps the dropping of the reference count, but sets
	  the pvt to NULL on the channel prior to releasing it. This models
	  what would occur if the channel was hung up directly. ........

	  res_corosync: Update module to work with Stasis (and compile)
	  This patch fixes res_corosync such that it works with Asterisk
	  12. This restores the functionality that was present in previous
	  versions of Asterisk, and ensures compatibility with those
	  versions by restoring the binary message format needed to pass
	  information from/to them. The following changes were made in the
	  core to support this: * The event system has been partially
	  restored. All event definition and event types in this patch were
	  pulled from Asterisk 11. Previously, we had hoped that this
	  information would live in res_corosync; however, the approach in
	  this patch seems to be better for a few reasons: (1)
	  Theoretically, ast_events can be used by any module as a binary
	  representation of a Stasis message. Given the structure of an
	  ast_event object, that information has to live in the core to be
	  used universally. For example, defining the payload of a device
	  state ast_event in res_corosync could result in an incompatible
	  device state representation in another module. (2) Much of this
	  representation already lived in the core, and was not easily
	  extensible. (3) The code already existed. :-) * Stasis message
	  types now have a message formatter that converts their payload to
	  an ast_event object. * Stasis message forwarders now handle
	  forwarding to themselves. Previously this would result in an
	  infinite recursive call. Now, this simply creates a new
	  forwarding object with no forwards set up (as it is the thing it
	  is forwarding to). This is advantageous for res_corosync, as
	  returning NULL would also imply an unrecoverable error. Returning
	  a subscription in this case allows for easier handling of message
	  types that are published directly to an aggregate topic that has
	  forwarders. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3486/

	  direct media bridges that occur after a blind transfer. These
	  issues were caught by the (currently failing)
	  pjsip/transfers/blind_transfer/caller_direct_media test. The test
	  currently fails primarily for two reasons: (1) When Bob and
	  Charlie (the transfer target and the transfer destination) enter
	  a bridge together, the framehook remains on the transfer target
	  channel until both channels are in the bridge. As it consumes
	  voice frames, the initial bridge type is a simple bridge. The
	  framehook is removed when both channels are in the bridge;
	  however, this does not currently cause the bridging framework to
	  re-evaluate the bridge. This patch adds a AST_SOFTHANGUP_UNBRIDGE
	  poke to the transfer target channel when a framehook is removed
	  so the bridge can re-evaluate itself. (2) When a channel leaves a
	  native RTP bridge, it may be leaving due to being hung up.
	  Sending a re-INVITE to a channel that is about to be hung up is
	  not nice - in fact, there's a good chance we'll send the BYE
	  request before the channel has had a chance to send back a 200
	  OK. To be somewhat nicer, this patch adds a function to channel.h
	  that allows the bridging framework to query for exactly why a
	  channel is leaving a bridge via the channel's soft hangup flags.
	  This allows it to only send the re-INVITE if there's a chance the
	  channel will survive the native bridging experience. Review:

	* configure.ac, channels/sig_pri.c, /, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in: chan_dahdi/sig_pri: Prevent
	  unnecessary PROGRESS events when overlap dialing is enabled. When
	  overlap dialing is enabled, the lack of inband audio available
	  information in the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE events causes an
	  interoperability problem with SIP. sig_pri doesn't know if there
	  is dialtone present when a SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE is received so it
	  assumes it is there and posts an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame. The
	  SIP channel driver then sends out a 183 Session Progress and
	  blocks the desired 180 Ringing message when the ALERTING message
	  comes in. * Made the configure script detect if the installed
	  version of libpri supports the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE enhancements. *
	  Using the new API, made generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame on
	  an incoming SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message when the message indicates
	  inband audio is present instead of assuming that dialtone is
	  present. * Using the new API, made SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE send out an
	  inband audio available indication only if dialtone is expected.
	  The change also makes the fallback behaviour of sending the
	  PROGRESS message better by sending it only if dialtone is
	  expected. * Changed receiving a PROCEEDING message to not
	  generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame if the progress indication
	  ie indicates non-end-to-end-ISDN. This helps interoperability
	  with SIP. * Changed sending a PROCEEDING message in response to
	  an AST_CONTROL_PROCEEDING frame to not indicate inband audio
	  available. It was silly to do so anyway because the channel
	  driver doesn't know if inband audio is even available. This helps
	  interoperability with SIP. This patch and a corresponding change
	  in libpri work together to allow Asterisk to control the inband
	  audio available progress indication ie on the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE
	  message when dialtone is present. AST-1338 #close Reported by:

	* res/res_config_pgsql.c, /: Return the number of rows affected by
	  a SQL insert, rather than an object ID. The realtime API
	  specifies that the store callback is supposed to return the
	  number of rows affected. res_config_pgsql was instead returning
	  an Oid cast as an int, which during any nominal execution would
	  be cast to 0. Returning 0 when more than 0 rows were inserted
	  causes problems to the function's callers. To give an idea of how
	  strange code can be, this is the necessary code change to fix a
	  device state issue reported against chan_pjsip in Asterisk 12+.
	  The issue was that the registrar would attempt to insert contacts
	  into the database. Because of the 0 return from res_config_pgsql,
	  the registrar would think that the contact was not successfully
	  inserted, even though it actually was. As such, even though the
	  contact was query-able and it was possible to call the endpoint,
	  Asterisk would "think" the endpoint was unregistered, meaning it
	  would report the device state as UNAVAILABLE instead of
	  NOT_INUSE. The necessary fix applies to all versions of Asterisk,
	  so even though the bug reported only applies to Asterisk 12+, the
	  code correction is being inserted into 1.8+. Closes issue

	* include/asterisk/spinlock.h (added), /, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: This patch adds
	  support for spinlocks in Asterisk. There are cases in Asterisk
	  where it might be desirable to lock a short critical code section
	  but not incur the context switch and yield penalty of a mutex or
	  rwlock. The primary spinlock implementations execute exclusively
	  in userspace and therefore don't incur those penalties. Spinlocks
	  are NOT meant to be a general replacement for mutexes. They
	  should be used only for protecting short blocks of critical code
	  such as simple compares and assignments. Operations that may
	  block, hold a lock, or cause the thread to give up it's timeslice
	  should NEVER be attempted in a spinlock. The first use case for
	  spinlocks is in astobj2 - internal_ao2_ref. Currently the
	  manipulation of the reference counter is done with an
	  ast_atomic_fetchadd_int which works fine. When weak reference
	  containers are introduced however, there's an additional
	  comparison and assignment that'll need to be done while the lock
	  is held. A mutex would be way too expensive here, hence the
	  spinlock. Given that lock contention in this situation would be
	  infrequent, the overhead of the spinlock is only a few more
	  machine instructions than the current ast_atomic_fetchadd_int
	  call. ASTERISK-23553 #close Review:

	  In r411189, some behavior was changed which made sendrpid

	  for peers set with private caller presence in P-Asserted-Identity
	  headers. Since this changed long time expected behaviors, we
	  decided to pull that patch when that was pointed out by the
	  community. Instead, this patch provides a trust_id_outbound
	  setting which will expose the data per RFC-3325 if set to 'yes'
	  and simply not send the PAI/RPID headers at all if set to 'no'.
	  By default trust_id_outbound will be set to 'legacy' which will
	  preserve the behavior prior to these patches. Extra special
	  thanks to Walter Doekes for providing advice and feedback.

	  caused issues). We now also no longer open/close the file on each
	  write, instead relying on fflush to make sure data gets written
	  to the file (in case the ao2 call being performed is about to
	  cause a crash) (3) It goes with a comma delineated format for the
	  ref debug file. This makes parsing much easier. This also now
	  includes the thread ID of the thread that caused ref change. (4)
	  A new python script instead for refcounting has been added in the

	* /, res/res_stasis.c: Stasis: Fix Stasis() bridge refcount issue
	  The Stasis() dialplan application monitors what bridge a channel
	  is in and so necessarily holds on to a bridge pointer. This
	  change ensures that it also holds on to a reference for that
	  bridge to prevent the bridge pointer from becoming a dangling

	* CHANGES, funcs/func_periodic_hook.c (added): func_periodic_hook:
	  New function for periodic hooks. This commit introduces a new
	  dialplan function, PERIODIC_HOOK(). It allows you run to a
	  dialplan hook on a channel periodically. The original use case
	  that inspired this was the ability to play a beep periodically
	  into a call being recorded. The implementation is much more
	  generic though and could be used for many other things. The
	  implementation makes heavy use of existing Asterisk components.
	  It uses a combination of Local channels and ChanSpy() to run some
	  custom dialplan and inject any audio it generates into an active
	  call. The other important bit of the implementation is how it
	  figures out when to trigger the beep playback. This
	  implementation uses the audiohook API, even though it's not
	  actually touching the audio in any way. It's a convenient way to
	  get a callback and check if it's time to kick off another beep.
	  It would be nice if this was timer event based instead of polling
	  based, but unfortunately I don't see a way to do it that won't
	  interfere with other things. Review:

	* include/asterisk/options.h, main/asterisk.c, main/channel.c, /,
	  channels/chan_sip.c, configs/asterisk.conf.sample, UPGRADE.txt,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h, utils/extconf.c: internal_timing:
	  Remove the option and always make it enabled if a timing module
	  is loaded. The masquerade supertest frequently fails because
	  either the local channel chain doesn't completely optimize out or
	  the DTMF handshake doesn't completely get accross. Local channel
	  optimization requires frames flowing to trigger when optimization
	  can happen. When optimization happens the media frame that
	  triggered the optimization is dropped. Sending DTMF requires
	  frames to flow in the other direction for timing purposes while
	  sending nothing. If internal timing is not enabled when MOH is
	  playing, Asterisk switches to received timing when an audio frame
	  is received. With optimization dropping media frames and MOH not
	  sending frames unless it receives frames, occasionaly there are
	  no more frames being passed and the test fails. * The asterisk
	  command line -I option and the asterisk.conf internal_timing
	  option are removed. Asterisk now always uses internal timing when
	  needed if any timing module is loaded. The issue ASTERISK-14861
	  did this quite awhile ago in v1.4 but effectively is broken if
	  other internal timing modules besides DAHDI are used. The
	  ast_read_generator_actions() now only does received timing if it
	  has no choice for frame generators like MOH, silence, and
	  playback streaming. * Cleaned up some code dealing with frame
	  generators in ast_deactivate_generator(),
	  generator_write_format_change(), ast_activate_generator(), and
	  ast_channel_stop_silence_generator(). * Removed
	  ast_internal_timing_enabled(), AST_OPT_FLAG_INTERNAL_TIMING, and

	* /, res/res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: PJSIP: Allow for
	  identify sections to be specified in sorcery.conf. "identify" is
	  a special type of configuration object in PJSIP because unlike
	  the other objects, it is not provided by the base res_pjsip
	  module. Instead, it is provided by the
	  res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip module. If using the default
	  sorcery wizard (config,criteria=type=identify) then things work
	  because the module that applies the default wizard is the correct
	  module. However, if attempting to use sorcery.conf to apply an
	  alternate wizard, it was not possible. If you attempted to
	  specify the identify object type in the res_pjsip section, then
	  the object could not be registered since the object was
	  undocumented for the res_pjsip module. There was no alternate
	  configuration section defined for it, so you were out of luck if
	  you wanted to override the default wizard. With this change, the
	  identify section will properly have a sorcery.conf-based wizard
	  applied when the identify definition is within the
	  res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip section. ........ Merged

	  ARI through the introduction of synchronous bridge actions.
	  Playing back a file to a channel in an ARI bridge would attempt
	  to wait until the playback concluded before returning. The method
	  used involved signaling the waiting thread in the ARI custom
	  playback function. The problem with this is that there were some
	  corner cases that were not accounted for: * If a bridge channel
	  could not be found, then we never would attempt the playback but
	  would still attempt to wait for the playback to complete. * If
	  the bridge playfile action failed to queue, we would still
	  attempt to wait for the playback to complete. * If the bridge
	  playfile action were queued but some circumstance caused the
	  playback not to occur (the bridge dies, the channel is removed
	  from the bridge), then we would never be notified. The solution
	  to this is to move the waiting logic into the bridge code. A new
	  bridge API function is added to queue a synchronous action on a
	  bridge. The waiting thread is notified when the queued frame has
	  been freed, either due to an error occurring or due to successful
	  playback. As a failsafe, the waiting thread has a 10 minute
	  timeout just in case there is a frame leak somewhere. Review:

	* res/res_pjsip_multihomed.c (added), /: res_pjsip_multihomed: Add
	  module which places the correct address within messages. Due to
	  how messages are handled within PJSIP it is not until a message
	  is actually sent that the destination is reliably known. This
	  means that the addresses placed within the message may not be of
	  the interface the message is being sent out on. This module
	  determines what interface a message is being sent on and updates
	  the message to contain the correct address if applicable. This
	  module was tested by myself in a virtualized environment with
	  multiple interfaces and also by Kinsey Moore in the following
	  configuration: Networks: * 10.24.16.0/21 ** hard phone ** default
	  gateway * 10.24.64.0/21 ** softphone with pjsip-based stack
	  Transport details: bind address: 0.0.0.0 protocol: UDP All
	  endpoints were tested with explicitly configured transports and
	  unconfigured transports. This was tested with inbound and
	  outbound calls, both of which were experiencing detrimental
	  effects from incorrect IP addresses in SIP messages. These
	  effects were only experienced by the soft phone on the 10.24.64.0
	  network since the messages to the hard phone on the 10.24.16.0
	  network had the correct IP address. (closes issue ASTERISK-23020)

	  args order to allocating channels was fixed in chan_mgcp and
	  chan_gtalk, and linkedid is no longer lost as masquerade occurs.

	* /, res/res_musiconhold.c: moh: fix a refcount error with realtime
	  MOH I observed a crash in res_musiconhold on an Asterisk 11
	  system using realtime MOH. Investigation of the backtrace showed
	  a corrupt mohclass, implying that it got destroyed before the
	  code expected it to. I went looking for reference counting errors
	  that could have caused this crash and this patch this result. It
	  contains 2 changes. 1) Remove a usless block of code that was
	  impossible to reach. There was even a comment indicating that it
	  was impossible to reach. The conditional includes
	  "!ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)" and it's
	  inside of an if block with the opposite check
	  "ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)". There's no
	  good reason to keep it around. 2) A similar block to #1 contained
	  a reference counting error. It stores state->class in the local
	  variable mohclass without increasing its reference count. The
	  reference count on mohclass is decremented at the end of the
	  function. This block of code probably very rarely runs, which
	  would help explain why this system was working fine for many
	  months before experiencing a crash. Review:

	  main/config.c, main/sorcery.c: sorcery: Create AST_SORCERY
	  dialplan function. This patch creates the AST_SORCERY dialplan
	  function which allows someone to retrieve any value from a
	  sorcery-based config file. It's similar to AST_CONFIG. The
	  creation of the function itself was fairly straightforward but it
	  required changes to the underlying sorcery infrastructure that
	  rippled into individual sorcery objects. The changes stemmed from
	  inconsistencies in how sorcery created ast_variable objectsets
	  from sorcery objects and the inconsistency in how individual
	  objects used that feature especially when it came to parameters
	  that can be specified multiple times like contact in aor and
	  match in identify. You can read more here...
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2014-February/065202.html
	  So, what this patch does, besides actually creating the
	  AST_SORCERY function, is the following... * Creates
	  ast_variable_list_append which is a helper to append one
	  ast_variable list to another. * Modifies the
	  ast_sorcery_object_field_register functions to accept the
	  already-defined sorcery_fields_handler callback. * Modifies
	  ast_sorcery_objectset_create to accept a parameter indicating
	  return type preference...a single ast_variable with all values
	  concatenated or an ast_variable list with multiple entries. Also
	  fixed a few bugs. * Modifies individual sorcery object
	  implementations to use the new function definition of the
	  ast_sorcery_object_field_register functions. * Modifies
	  location.c and res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c to implement
	  sorcery_fields_handler handlers so they return multiple
	  occurrences as an ast_variable_list. * Added a whole bunch of
	  tests to test_sorcery. (closes issue ASTERISK-22537) Review:

	* /, res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Apply
	  packetization rules on inbound SDP handling The setting
	  'use_ptime' is supposed to tell Asterisk to honour the ptime
	  attribute in an offer, preferring it to whatever packetization
	  preferences have been set internally. Currently, however,
	  something rather quirky will happen: (1) The SDP answer will be
	  constructed in create_outgoing_sdp_stream. This will use the
	  preferences from the endpoint, such that the 200 OK response will
	  add the packetization preferences from the endpoint, and not what
	  was offered. (2) When the 200 response is issued,
	  apply_negotiated_sdp_stream is called. This will call
	  apply_packetization, which will use the ptime attribute from the
	  offer internally. We end up telling the offerer to use the
	  internal ptime attribute, but we end up using the offered ptime
	  attribute. Hilarity ensues. This patch modifies the behaviour by
	  calling apply_packetization from negotiate_incoming_sdp_stream,
	  which is called prior to create_outgoing_sdp_stream. This causes
	  the format preferences on the session's media object to be set to
	  the inbound ptime value (if 'use_ptime' is enabled), such that
	  the construction of the answer gets the right value immediately.

	* /, main/asterisk.c: main: Initialize dialplan providing core
	  components prior to module pre-load It is possible to pre-load

	  the dialplan - will attempt to use various dialplan components,
	  such as device state providers and presence state providers,
	  prior to them being initialized by the core. This would lead to a
	  crash, as the components had not created their Stasis cache
	  entries. This patch moves a number of core component
	  initializations before the module pre-load. This guarantees that
	  if someone does pre-load pbx_config - or other pbx modules - that
	  the Stasis caches for the various core components are created.

	* /, main/pbx.c: pbx: Handle a completely empty dialplan during a
	  context merge It is highly unlikely, but - at least in Asterisk
	  12 - theoretically possible to load Asterisk with no dialplan
	  whatsoever. If that occurs, and some other module (that is not a
	  pbx module) attempts to merge its contexts into the dialplan, the
	  existing merge routine will crash. This is because it is not
	  insane, and rightly believes that you provided some sort of
	  dialplan, somewhere. This patch will gracefully merge the
	  contexts in such a case. Note that this is highly unlikely to
	  occur in 1.8/11, as features will most likely provide some
	  dialplan via parking. However, in Asterisk 12, parking is now
	  provided by res_parking, and hence may create its dialplan later.

	* main/stasis_endpoints.c, /: ARI: correct upper/lower case URI

	  control frame. (on v1.8 AST_CONTROL_CONNECTED_LINE = 22) 3) v1.4
	  receives the control frame as an end-of-q (on v1.4
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q = 22) 4) v1.4 disconnects the call once the
	  receive queue becomes empty. Several things are done by this
	  patch to fix the problem and attempt to prevent it from happening
	  again in the future: * Added a warning at the definition of enum
	  ast_control_frame_type about how to add new control frame values.
	  * Made block sending and receiving control frames that have no
	  reason to go over the wire. * Extended the connectedline iax.conf
	  parameter to also include the redirecting information updates. *
	  Updated the connectedline iax.conf parameter documentation to
	  include a notice that the parameter must be "no" when the peer is
	  an Asterisk v1.4 instance. (closes issue AST-1302) Review:

	  UPGRADE.txt, main/manager_channels.c: CDRs: fix a variety of dial
	  status problems, h/hangup handler creating CDRs This patch fixes
	  a number of small-ish problems that were noticed when witnessing
	  the records that the FreePBX dialplan produces: (1) Mid-call
	  events (as well as privacy options) have the ability to change
	  the overall state of the Dial operation after the called party
	  answers. This means that publishing the DialEnd event when the
	  called party is premature; we have to wait for the execution of
	  these subroutines to complete before we can signal the overall
	  status of the DialEnd. This patch moves that publication and adds
	  handlers for the mid-call events. (2) The AST_FLAG_OUTGOING
	  channel flag is cleared if an after bridge goto datastore is
	  detected. This flag was preventing CDRs from being recorded for
	  all outbound channels that had a 'continue' option enabled on
	  them by the Dial application. (3) The CDR engine now locks the
	  'Dial' application as being the CDR application if it detects
	  that the current CDR has entered that app. This is similar to the
	  logic that is done for Parking. In general, if we entered into
	  Dial, then we want that CDR to record the application as such -
	  this prevents pre-dial handlers, mid-call handlers, and other
	  shenaniganry from changing the application value. (4) The CDR
	  engine now checks for the AST_SOFTHANGUP_HANGUP_EXEC in more
	  places to determine if the channel is in hangup logic or dead. In
	  either case, we don't want to record changes in the channel. (5)
	  The default option for "endbeforehexten" has been changed to
	  "yes". In general, you don't want to see CDRs in the 'h' exten or
	  in hangup logic. Since the semantics of that option changed in
	  12, it made sense to update the default value as well. (6)
	  Finally, because we now have the ability to synchronize on the
	  messages published to the CDR topic, on shutdown the CDR engine
	  will now synchronize to the messages currently in flight. This
	  helps to ensure that all in-flight CDRs are written before
	  shutting down. (closes issue ASTERISK-23164) Reported by: Matt

	* apps/app_dial.c, /: app_dial: Allow macro/gosub pre-bridge
	  execution to occur on priorities The parsing for the destination
	  of the macro/gosub uses the '^' character to separate out
	  context, extension, and priority. However, the logic for the
	  macro/gosub execution was written such that it would only do the
	  actual macro/gosub jump if a '^' character existed. This doesn't
	  apply when the macro/gosub jump occurs in a priority/priority
	  label. This patch changes the logic so that the parsing still

	  the PJSIP pubsub framework was created, subscription handlers
	  were required to state what event they handled along with what
	  body types they knew how to generate. While this serves well when
	  implementing a base RFC, it has problems when trying to extend
	  the body to support non-standard or proprietary body elements.
	  The code also was NOTIFY-specific, meaning that when the time
	  comes that we start writing code to send out PUBLISH requests
	  with MWI or presence bodies, we would likely find ourselves
	  duplicating code that had previously been written. This changeset
	  introduces the concept of body generators and body supplements. A
	  body generator is responsible for allocating a native structure
	  for a given body type, providing the primary body content,
	  converting the native structure to a string, and deallocating
	  resources. A body supplement takes the primary body content (the
	  native structure, not a string) generated by the body generator
	  and adds nonstandard elements to the body. With these elements
	  living in their own module, it becomes easy to extend our support
	  for body types and to re-use resources when sending a PUBLISH
	  request. Body generators and body supplements register themselves
	  with the pubsub core, similar to how subscription and publish
	  handlers had done. Now, subscription handlers do not need to know
	  what type of body content they generate, but they still need to
	  inform the pubsub core about what the default body type for a
	  given event package is. The pubsub core keeps track of what body
	  generators and body supplements have been registered. When a
	  SUBSCRIBE arrives, the pubsub core will check that there is a
	  subscription handler for the event in the SUBSCRIBE, then it will
	  check that there is a body generator that can provide the content
	  specified in the Accept header(s). Because of the nature of body
	  generators and supplements, it means res_pjsip_exten_state and
	  res_pjsip_mwi have been completely gutted. They no longer worry
	  about body types, instead calling
	  ast_sip_pubsub_generate_body_content() when they need to generate
	  a NOTIFY body. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3150

	  fix support for allow=all This change adds improvements to
	  support for allow=all in pjsip.conf so that it functions as
	  intended. Previously, the allow/disallow socery configuration
	  would set & clear codecs from the media.codecs and media.prefs
	  list, but if all was specified the prefs list was not updated.
	  Then a call would fail when create_outgoing_sdp_stream() created
	  an SDP with no audio codecs. A new function
	  ast_codec_pref_append_all() is provided to add all codecs to the
	  prefs list - only those not already on the list. This enables the
	  configuration to specify a codec preference, but still add all
	  codecs, and even then remove some codecs, as shown in this
	  example: allow = ulaw, alaw, all, !g729, !g723 Also, the display
	  order of allow in cli output is updated to match the
	  configuration by using prefs instead of caps when generating a
	  human readable string. Finally, a change to
	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream() skips a codec when it does not have
	  a payload code instead of the call failing. (closes issue

	  main/logger.c, UPGRADE.txt: verbosity: Fix performance of console
	  verbose messages. The per console verbose level feature as
	  previously implemented caused a large performance penalty. The
	  fix required some minor incompatibilities if the new rasterisk is
	  used to connect to an earlier version. If the new rasterisk
	  connects to an older Asterisk version then the root console
	  verbose level is always affected by the "core set verbose"
	  command of the remote console even though it may appear to only
	  affect the current console. If an older version of rasterisk
	  connects to the new version then the "core set verbose" command
	  will have no effect. * Fixed the verbose performance by not
	  generating a verbose message if nothing is going to use it and
	  then filtered any generated verbose messages before actually
	  sending them to the remote consoles. * Split the "core set debug"
	  and "core set verbose" CLI commands to remove the per module
	  verbose support that cannot work with the per console verbose
	  level. * Added a silent option to the "core set verbose" command.
	  * Fixed "core set debug off" tab completion. * Made "core show
	  settings" list the current console verbosity in addition to the
	  root console verbosity. * Changed the default verbose level of
	  the 'verbose' setting in the logger.conf [logfiles] section. The
	  default is now to once again follow the current root console
	  level. As a result, using the AMI Command action with "core set
	  verbose" could again set the root console verbose level and
	  affect the verbose level logged. (closes issue AST-1252) Reported

	* res/res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c: Fix erroneous behavior when
	  sending auth rejection to artificial endpoint. We were not
	  including an authentication challenge when sending a 401 response
	  to unmatched endpoints. This was due to the conversion to use a
	  vector for authentication section names on an endpoint. The
	  vector for artificial endpoints was empty, resulting in the
	  challenge being sent back containing no challenges. This is
	  worked around by placing a bogus value in the artificial
	  endpoint's auth vector. This value is never looked up by
	  anything, since they instead will directly call
	  ast_sip_get_artificial_auth().

	  applications that manipulate CDRs with the engine In
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3057/, applications and
	  functions that manipulate CDRs were made to interact over Stasis.
	  This was done to synchronize manipulations of CDRs from the
	  dialplan with the updates the engine itself receives over the
	  message bus. This change rested on a faulty premise: that
	  messages published to the CDR topic or to a topic that forwards
	  to the CDR topic are synchronized with the messages handled by
	  the CDR topic subscription in the CDR engine. This is not the
	  case. There is no ordering guaranteed for two messages published
	  to the same topic; ordering is only guaranteed if a message is
	  published to the same subscriber. Stasis was modified in r405311
	  to allow a publisher to synchronize on the subscriber. This patch
	  uses that API to synchronize the CDR publishers with the CDR
	  engine message router, which maintains the overall topic
	  subscription. (closes issue ASTERISK-22884) Reported by: Matt

	  stasis: Add methods to allow for synchronous publishing to
	  subscriber This patch adds an API call to Stasis that allows a
	  publisher to publish a stasis message that will not return until
	  a specific subscriber handles the message. Since a subscriber can
	  have their own forwarding topic which orders messages from many
	  topics, this allows a publisher who knows of that subscriber to
	  synchronize to that subscriber regardless of the forwarding
	  relationships between topics. This is of particular use for
	  dialplan applications that need to synchronize on a particular
	  subscriber's handling of a message. (issue ASTERISK-22884)

	* /, apps/app_confbridge.c,
	  apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c: app_confbridge: Fix
	  crash caused when waitmarked/marked users leave together When
	  waitmarked users join a ConfBridge, the conference state is
	  transitioned from EMPTY -> INACTIVE. In this state, the users are
	  maintined in a waiting users list. When a marked user joins, the
	  ConfBridge conference transitions from INACTIVE -> MULTI_MARKED,
	  and all users are put onto the active list of users. This process
	  works correctly. When the marked user leaves, if they are the
	  last marked user, the MULTI_MARKED state does the following: (1)
	  It plays back a message to the bridge stating that the leader has
	  left the conference. This requires an unlocking of the bridge.
	  (2) It moves waitmarked users back to the waiting list (3) It
	  transitions to the appropriate state: in this case, INACTIVE
	  However, because it plays the prompt back to the bridge before
	  moving the users and before finishing the state transition, this
	  creates a race condition: with the bridge unlocked, waitmarked
	  users who leave the conference (or are kicked from it) can cause
	  a state transition of the bridge to another state before the
	  conference is transitioned to the INACTIVE state. This causes the
	  state machine to get a bit wonky, often leading to a crash when
	  the MULTI_MARKED state attempts to conclude its processing. This
	  patch fixes this problem: (1) It prevents kicked users from being
	  kicked again. That's just a nicety. (2) More importantly, it
	  fixes the race condition by only playing the prompt once the
	  state has transitioned correctly to INACTIVE. If waitmarked users
	  sneak out during the prompt being played, no harm no foul.

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, res/res_pjsip.c, main/channel.c, /,
	  include/asterisk/autochan.h: Fix a deadlock that occurred due to
	  a conflict of masquerades. For the explanation, here is a
	  copy-paste of the review board explanation: Initially, it was
	  discovered that performing an attended transfer of a multiparty
	  bridge with a PJSIP channel would cause a deadlock. A PBX thread
	  started a masquerade and reached the point where it was calling
	  the fixup() callback on the "original" channel. For chan_pjsip,
	  this involves pushing a synchronous task to the session's
	  serializer. The problem was that a task ahead of the fixup task
	  was also attempting to perform a channel masquerade. However,
	  since masquerades are designed in a way to only allow for one to
	  occur at a time, the task ahead of the fixup could not continue
	  until the masquerade already in progress had completed. And of
	  course, the masquerade in progress could not complete until the
	  task ahead of the fixup task had completed. Deadlock. The initial
	  fix was to change the fixup task to be asynchronous. While this
	  prevented the deadlock from occurring, it had the frightful side
	  effect of potentially allowing for tasks in the session's
	  serializer to operate on a zombie channel. Taking a step back
	  from this particular deadlock, it became clear that the problem
	  was not really this one particular issue but that masquerades
	  themselves needed to be addressed. A PJSIP attended transfer
	  operation calls ast_channel_move(), which attempts to both set up
	  and execute a masquerade. The problem was that after it had set
	  up the masquerade, the PBX thread had swooped in and tried to
	  actually perform the masquerade. Looking at changes that had been
	  made to Asterisk 12, it became clear that there never is any time
	  now that anyone ever wants to set up a masquerade and allow for
	  the channel thread to actually perform the masquerade. Everyone
	  always is calling ast_channel_move(), performs the masquerade
	  itself before returning. In this patch, I have removed all blocks
	  of code from channel.c that will attempt to perform a masquerade
	  if ast_channel_masq() returns true. Now, there is no distinction
	  between setting up a masquerade and performing the masquerade. It
	  is one operation. The only remaining checks for
	  ast_channel_masq() and ast_channel_masqr() are in ast_hangup()
	  since we do not want to interrupt a masquerade by hanging up the
	  channel. Instead, now ast_hangup() will wait for a masquerade to
	  complete before moving forward with its operation. The
	  ast_channel_move() function has been modified to basically
	  in-line the logic that used to be in ast_channel_masquerade().
	  ast_channel_masquerade() has been killed off for real.
	  ast_channel_move() now has a lock associated with it that is used
	  to prevent any simultaneous moves from occurring at once. This
	  means there is no need to make sure that ast_channel_masq() or
	  ast_channel_masqr() are already set on a channel when
	  ast_channel_move() is called. It also means the channel container
	  lock is not pulling double duty by both keeping the container
	  locked and preventing multiple masquerades from occurring
	  simultaneously. The ast_do_masquerade() function has been renamed
	  to do_channel_masquerade() and is now internal to channel.c. The
	  function now takes explicit arguments of which channels are
	  involved in the masquerade instead of a single channel. While it
	  probably is possible to do some further refactoring of this
	  method, I feel that I would be treading dangerously. Instead, all
	  I did was change some comments that no longer are true after this
	  changeset. The other more minor change introduced in this patch
	  is to res_pjsip.c to make ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() run the
	  task in-place if we are already a SIP servant thread. This is
	  related to this patch because even when we isolate the channel
	  masquerade to only running in the SIP servant thread, we would
	  still deadlock when the fixup() callback is reached since we
	  would essentially be waiting forever for ourselves to finish
	  before actually running the fixup. This makes it so the fixup is
	  run without having to push a task into a serializer at all.

	  option. The legacy option will only work for app_voicemail

	  format of the mailbox identifer used by app_voicemail. chan_sip
	  and chan_dahdi/sig_pri had the most changes because they both
	  tried to interpret the mailbox identifier. chan_sip just stored
	  and compared the two components. chan_dahdi actually used the box
	  information. The ISDN MWI support configuration options had to be
	  reworked because chan_dahdi was parsing the box@context format to
	  get the box number. As a result the mwi_vm_boxes chan_dahdi.conf

	  Synchronize with engine when manipulating state When doing the
	  rework of the CDR engine that pushed all of the logic into cdr.c
	  and made it respond to changes in channel state over Stasis, we
	  knew that accessing the CDR engine from the dialplan would be
	  "slightly" non-deterministic. Dialplan threads would be accessing
	  CDRs while Stasis threads would be updating the state of said
	  CDRs - whereas in the past, everything happened on the dialplan
	  threads. Tests have shown that "slightly" is in reality "very".
	  This patch synchronizes things by making the dialplan
	  applications/functions that manipulate CDRs do so over Stasis.
	  ForkCDR, NoCDR, ResetCDR, CDR, and CDR_PROP now all use Stasis to
	  send their requests over to the CDR engine, and synchronize on
	  the channel Stasis topic via a subscription so that they return
	  their values/control to the dialplan at the appropriate time.
	  While going through this, the following changes were also made: *
	  DISA, which can reset the CDR when a user successfully
	  authenticates, now just uses the ResetCDR app to do this. This
	  prevents having to duplicate the same Stasis synchronization
	  logic in that application. * Answer no longer disables CDRs. It
	  actually didn't work anyway - calling DISABLE on the channel's
	  CDR doesn't stop the CDR from getting the Answer time - it just
	  kills all CDRs on that channel, which isn't what the caller would
	  intend. (closes issue ASTERISK-22884) (closes issue

	  channel locking: Add locking for channel snapshot creation
	  Original commit message by mmichelson (asterisk 12 r403311):
	  "This adds channel locks around calls to create channel snapshots
	  as well as other functions which operate on a channel and then
	  end up creating a channel snapshot. Functions that expect the
	  channel to be locked prior to being called have had their
	  documentation updated to indicate such." The above was initially
	  committed and then reverted at r403398. The problem was found to
	  be in core_local.c in the publish_local_bridge_message function.
	  The ast_unreal_lock_all function locks and adds a reference to
	  the returned channels and while they were being unlocked they
	  were not being unreffed when no longer needed. Fixed by unreffing
	  the channels. Also in bridge.c a lock was obtained on
	  "other->chan", but then an attempt was made to unlock "other" and
	  not the previously locked channel. Fixed by unlocking
	  "other->chan" (closes issue ASTERISK-22709) Reported by: John

	* /, res/ari/resource_channels.c: ari/resource_channels: When
	  creating a channel, specify a default format (SLIN) When creating
	  channels via ARI, the current code fails to provide any default
	  format capabilities. For non-virtual channels this isn't really a
	  problem - the channels typically receive their capabilities as a
	  result of the underlying channel driver configuration. For
	  virtual channels (such as Local channels), the lack of any format
	  capabilities causes the Asterisk core to make some 'odd' choices
	  with respect to the translation paths. The issue reporter had
	  some paths that had 3 hops on each channel leg, causing multiple
	  transcodings and some really crappy audio/performance. By
	  specifying a baseline of SLIN, we prevent that from occurring.
	  Note that this is what AMI does when it performs an Originate, as
	  does res_clioriginate. Review:

	  UPGRADE-12.txt: security: Inhibit execution of privilege
	  escalating functions This patch allows individual dialplan
	  functions to be marked as 'dangerous', to inhibit their execution
	  from external sources. A 'dangerous' function is one which
	  results in a privilege escalation. For example, if one were to
	  read the channel variable SHELL(rm -rf /) Bad Things(TM) could
	  happen; even if the external source has only read permissions.
	  Execution from external sources may be enabled by setting
	  'live_dangerously' to 'yes' in the [options] section of
	  asterisk.conf. Although doing so is not recommended. Also, the
	  ABI was changed to something more reasonable, since Asterisk 12
	  does not yet have a public release. (closes issue ASTERISK-22905)

	* /, res/res_fax_spandsp.c: res_fax_spandsp: Always init T.38
	  session to avoid crashes during state change Prior to this patch,
	  res_fax_spandsp was conservative with how it initialized the
	  spandsp T.38 context. It would only initialize it if the driver
	  thought the current state was a T.38 fax. While this works fine
	  in nominal situations, in certain off nominal situations,
	  res_fax_spandsp can believe that a T.38 fax will not occur when
	  in fact one has started. In particular, this was discovered when
	  res_fax would fall back to audio after timing out on a T.38
	  upgrade. The SIP channel driver would continue to retry the
	  re-INVITE and - if the remote end responded after res_fax timed
	  out with a 200 OK - a T.38 frame would be delivered to the
	  res_fax stack when it no longer expected it. As it turns out,
	  there does not appear to be any downside to always initializing
	  the T.38 context, other than the actual memory allocation. Since
	  that avoids this off nominal situation (and others which are
	  equally likely hard to predict), this is the safest way to avoid
	  this problem. Much thanks to Torrey as well for providing a
	  scenario that reproduces this issue. (closes issue

	  Create/Change the state of an ARI controlled device PUT

	  controlled devices GET /deviceStates Retrieve the current state
	  of a device GET /deviceStates/{deviceName} Destroy a device-state

	  controlled device must begin with 'Stasis:'. An example
	  controlled device name would be Stasis:Example. A
	  'DeviceStateChanged' event has also been added so that an
	  application can subscribe and receive device change events. Any
	  device state, ARI controlled or not, can be subscribed to. While
	  adding the event, the underlying subscription control mechanism
	  was refactored so that all current and future resource

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: crash if first agent is "busy" If
	  the first agent/member (via CLI "queue show") in a queue is
	  "busy" (dnd, circuit busy, etc...) and no agents answered then
	  app_queue would crash. This occurred because while the calling of
	  agent(s) remained valid the channel on "busy" agent would be set
	  to NULL and then later dereferenced upon a second "rna" function
	  call. The original intention of the code is to have only valid
	  "call attempt" objects (channels != NULL) checked while
	  attempting to call agent(s). It does this by building a
	  "call_next" list of valid "call attempt" objects. In the case of
	  the "busy" agent subsequent builds of the valid "call attempt"
	  list would sometimes include (the case mentioned above) an
	  invalid "call attempt" object. The fix was to make sure the "call
	  attempt" list was appropriately built on every iteration. A NULL
	  sanity check was also added at the original offending spot of the
	  crash just in case another one slipped by somehow. (closes issue

	* main/loader.c, /: core/loader: Don't call dlclose in a while loop
	  For awhile now, we've noticed continuous integration builds
	  hanging on CentOS 6 64-bit build agents. After resolving a number
	  of problems with symbols, strange locks, and other shenanigans,
	  the problem has persisted. In all cases, gdb shows the Asterisk
	  process stuck in loader.c on one of the infinite while loops that
	  calls dlclose repeatedly until success. The documentation of
	  dlclose states that it returns 0 on success; any other value on
	  error. It does not state that repeatedly calling it will
	  eventually clear those errors. Most likely, the repeated calls to
	  dlclose was to force a close by exhausting the references on the
	  library; however, that will never succeed if: (a) There is some
	  fundamental error at work in the loaded library that precludes
	  unloading it (b) Some other loaded module is referencing a symbol
	  in the currently loaded module This results in Asterisk sitting
	  forever. Since we have matching pairs of dlopen/dlclose, this
	  patch opts to only call dlclose once, and log out as an ERROR if
	  dlclose fails to return success. If nothing else, this might help
	  to determine why on the CentOS 6 64-bit build agent things are
	  not closing successfully. Review:

	* main/xmldoc.c, main/channel.c, main/pbx.c, /, main/translate.c:
	  Remove some spammy debug messages; improve clarity of others
	  Debug messages aren't free. Even when the debug level is
	  sufficiently low such that the messages are never evaluated,
	  there is a cost to having to parse Asterisk logs that contain
	  debug messages that (a) fail to convey sufficient information or
	  (b) occur so frequently as to be next to meaningless. Based on
	  having to stare at lots of DEBUG messages, this patch makes the
	  following changes: * channel.c: When copying variables from a
	  parent channel to a child channel, specify the channels involved.
	  Do not log anything for a variable that is not inherited; the
	  fact that it doesn't have an _ or __ already signifies that it
	  won't be inherited. * pbx.c: Specify what function evaluation has
	  occurred that created the result. * translate.c: Bump up the
	  translator path messages to 10. I've never once had to use these
	  debug messages, and for each format that is registered (on
	  startup) and unregistered (on shutdown) the entire f^2 matrix is
	  logged out. For short tests in the Asterisk Test Suite, this
	  should make finding the actual test much easier. * xmldoc.c: The
	  debug message that 'blah' is not found in the tree is expected.
	  Often, description elements - which are not required - are not
	  provided. This debug message adds no additional value, as it is
	  not indicative of an error or helpful in debugging which element
	  did not contain a 'blah' element as a child. If an element is
	  supposed to contain a child element, then that XML tree should
	  have failed validation in the first place. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, UPGRADE-12.txt: chan_sip: Clarify
	  'Forcerport' Setting Displayed When Running "sip show peers"
	  While looking at ASTERISK-22236, Walter Doekes pointed out that
	  when running "sip show peers", the setting being displayed can be
	  confusing. The display of "N" used to mean NAT (i.e. yes). The
	  NAT setting has gone through many different changes resulting in
	  the display of different characters to try and convey what the
	  current setting is for 'Forcerport' (A for Auto and Forcerport is
	  currently on, a for Auto but Forcerport is off, Y for yes, and N
	  for no). During the initial code review to try and clarify these
	  settings (especially since "N" no longer meant what it used to
	  mean in prior versions of Asterisk), Mark Michelson suggested
	  using the full space available to display the settings which
	  helped to make the settings very clear. That was a great
	  suggestion. Therefore, this patch does the following: * The
	  column for 'Forcerport' now will show: Auto (Yes), Auto (No),
	  Yes, or No. * A column for the 'Comedia' setting has been added.
	  It too will display the setting in a non-cryptic way: Auto (Yes),
	  Auto (No), Yes, or No. * UPGRADE.txt has been updated to document
	  this change. (closes issue ASTERISK-22728) Reported by: Walter

	  caller id that deleted exten still in hash This fixes a bug where
	  a zero length callerid match adjacent to a no match callerid
	  extension entry would be deleted together, which then resulted in
	  hashtable references to free'd memory. A third state of the
	  matchcid value has been added to indicate match to any extension
	  which allows enforcing comparison of matchcid on/off without
	  errors. (closes issue AST-1235) Reported by: Guenther Kelleter

	* tests/test_json.c, /: test_json: Fix deprecation warnings After a
	  series of upgrades over recent weeks, I've discovered that
	  test_json.c won't compile in dev mode any more for me. One of
	  gcc-4.8.2, OS X Mavericks or Xcode 5 has decided to deprecate
	  tempnam. Which, in general, is a good thing. But for test code
	  that just needs a temporary file, it's just annoying. This patch
	  replaces usage of tempname with mkstemp, avoiding the deprecation
	  warning. It also removes the temporary files when the test is
	  complete, which apparently we weren't doing before (oops).

	  on the subtype, the base type has a 'subTypes' field, which is a
	  list of the subTypes. Given that its a messaging model and not an
	  object model, kinda makes sense. This patch changes the
	  events.json api-doc, and the python translators to take the new
	  format into account. Other changes that are in Swagger 1.2 were
	  not adopted, since the spec is still in flux, and could change
	  before it's finalized. A summary of changes to the Swagger-1.2

	* main/sorcery.c, main/cli.c, main/manager.c, /, main/bridge.c,

	  something like: for (ao2_obj = list_beginning; ao2_obj =
	  next_item; ao2_ref(ao2_obj, -1)) { ...do stuff... } This is nice
	  because it automatically takes care of the object references for
	  you. However, there is a pitfall here. If a break statement is in
	  the for loop, then the current reference is not cleaned up. In
	  some cases, this is on purpose, but in others there is a leak.

	* /, res/res_fax.c, include/asterisk/channel.h, apps/app_dial.c,

	  members created a situation where the endpoint was considered in
	  use, but the state change of the device being available again was
	  ignored (not cached). The endpoint channel was optimized into the
	  (previously) Local channel, but kept the do-not-cache flag. The

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Setting A chan_sip Dialog's
	  SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT Flag A condition was added in a commit to fix
	  ASTERISK-21374, that, if the SIP_PAGE3_NAT_AUTO_RPORT flag was
	  set, to then copy a peer's SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT flag to the
	  dialog. This condition should not have been there since it
	  assumed that if Asterisk is in an environment where NAT is
	  involved, that the auto_* nat settings or force_rport setting
	  would be on in the global settings. If the nat setting in the
	  global setting is set to 'nat=no' and then turned on for peers
	  (which is not quite the recommended way, although it is allowed)
	  this flag is never copied to the dialog resulting in problems
	  like, REGISTER replies going to the wrong port. This patch
	  removes this conditional check and will now always use the peer's
	  flag which by this point in the code the checks on whether the
	  peer is behind NAT or not (if using auto_force_rport) have
	  already been run. (closes issue ASTERISK-22236) Reported by:

	* bridges/bridge_softmix.c, /: Softmix: Fix crash when switching
	  from softmix to another bridge technology. The crash is caused by
	  a race condition when switching between native RTP and softmix
	  bridging technologies. In this situation, the bridging technology
	  is switched from native RTP to softmix, and then back to native
	  RTP fast enough that the softmix private data gets destroyed
	  before the softmix mixing thread gets started. Thanks to Kinsey
	  Moore for the crash analysis. * Fix race condition when starting

	* res/res_pjsip_header_funcs.c (added), /: Add PJSIP_HEADER
	  function for manipulation of SIP headers in the PJSIP stack This
	  patch adds support to the PJSIP stack in Asterisk for SIP header
	  manipulation. Note that this is analagous to
	  SIPAddHeader/SIPRemoveHeader. For PJSIP_HEADER, an incoming
	  supplemental session callback is registered that takes the
	  pjsip_hdrs from the incoming session and stores them in a linked
	  list in the session datastore. Calls to PJSIP_HEADER traverse
	  over the list and return the nth matching header where 'n' is the
	  'number' argument to the function. When adding a header, the
	  first call creates a datastore and linked list and adds the
	  datastore to the session. The header is then created as a
	  pjsip_hdr and added to the list. An outgoing supplemental session
	  callback then traverses the list and adds the headers to the
	  outgoing pjsip_msg. When removing a header, the list created with
	  PJSIP_HEADER(add,...) is traversed and all matching entries are
	  removed. (closes issue ASTERISK-22498) Reported by: George Joseph

	  When a party leaves a bridge, there may be more participants in

	  assumed that these were the two channels that had been bridged.
	  As previously stated, a new party had been inserted into the

	  improvements This patch addresses several performance problems
	  that were found in the initial performance testing of Asterisk
	  12. The Stasis dispatch object was allocated as an AO2 object,
	  even though it has a very confined lifecycle. This was replaced
	  with a straight ast_malloc(). The Stasis message router was
	  spending an inordinate amount of time searching hash tables. In
	  this case, most of our routers had 6 or fewer routes in them to
	  begin with. This was replaced with an array that's searched
	  linearly for the route. We more heavily rely on AO2 objects in
	  Asterisk 12, and the memset() in ao2_ref() actually became
	  noticeable on the profile. This was #ifdef'ed to only run when
	  AO2_DEBUG was enabled. After being misled by an erroneous comment
	  in taskprocessor.c during profiling, the wrong comment was
	  removed. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2873/

	  2013) | 24 lines Taskprocessor optimization; switch Stasis to use
	  taskprocessors This patch optimizes taskprocessor to use a
	  semaphore for signaling, which the OS can do a better job at
	  managing contention and waiting that we can with a mutex and
	  condition. The taskprocessor execution was also slightly
	  optimized to reduce the number of locks taken. The only
	  observable difference in the taskprocessor implementation is that
	  when the final reference to the taskprocessor goes away, it will
	  execute all tasks to completion instead of discarding the
	  unexecuted tasks. For systems where unnamed semaphores are not
	  supported, a really simple semaphore implementation is provided.
	  (Which gives identical performance as the original taskprocessor
	  implementation). The way we ended up implementing Stasis caused
	  the threadpool to be a burden instead of a boost to performance.
	  This was switched to just use taskprocessors directly for
	  subscriptions. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2881/

	  2013) | 28 lines Optimize how Stasis forwards are dispatched This
	  patch optimizes how forwards are dispatched in Stasis.
	  Originally, forwards were dispatched as subscriptions that are
	  invoked on the publishing thread. This did not account for the
	  vast number of forwards we would end up having in the system, and
	  the amount of work it would take to walk though the forward
	  subscriptions. This patch modifies Stasis so that rather than
	  walking the tree of forwards on every dispatch, when forwards and
	  subscriptions are changed, the subscriber list for every topic in
	  the tree is changed. This has a couple of benefits. First, this
	  reduces the workload of dispatching messages. It also reduces
	  contention when dispatching to different topics that happen to
	  forward to the same aggregation topic (as happens with all of the
	  channel, bridge and endpoint topics). Since forwards are no
	  longer subscriptions, the bulk of this patch is simply changing
	  stasis_subscription objects to stasis_forward objects (which,
	  admittedly, I should have done in the first place.) Since this
	  required me to yet again put in a growing array, I finally
	  abstracted that out into a set of ast_vector macros in
	  asterisk/vector.h. Review:

	  | 2013-09-30 13:48:57 -0500 (Mon, 30 Sep 2013) | 28 lines Remove
	  dispatch object allocation from Stasis publishing While looking
	  for areas for performance improvement, I realized that an unused
	  feature in Stasis was negatively impacting performance. When a
	  message is sent to a subscriber, a dispatch object is allocated
	  for the dispatch, containing the topic the message was published
	  to, the subscriber the message is being sent to, and the message
	  itself. The topic is actually unused by any subscriber in
	  Asterisk today. And the subscriber is associated with the
	  taskprocessor the message is being dispatched to. First, this
	  patch removes the unused topic parameter from Stasis subscription
	  callbacks. Second, this patch introduces the concept of
	  taskprocessor local data, data that may be set on a taskprocessor
	  and provided along with the data pointer when a task is pushed
	  using the ast_taskprocessor_push_local() call. This allows the
	  task to have both data specific to that taskprocessor, in
	  addition to data specific to that invocation. With those two
	  changes, the dispatch object can be removed completely, and the
	  message is simply refcounted and sent directly to the
	  taskprocessor. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2884/

	  This adds a global option in chan_sip to allow it to continue

	  (added): res_pjsip_notify: Add documentation We forgot to add
	  documentation for res_pjsip_notify, which would prevent it from

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, /: res_rtp_asterisk: Correct erroneous
	  lost packet information in RTCP reports RTCP's calculation of the
	  number of lost packets in an RTP stream is based on that stream's
	  sequence number count, the number of received packets, and how
	  many packets we expect to receive. When the SSRC for an RTP
	  stream changes, there can - and almost always will be - a large
	  jump in the next packet's timestamp and sequence number. If we
	  don't reset the number of received packets, sequence number
	  count, and other metrics used by RTCP, the next RR/SR report will
	  use the previous SSRC's values to calculate the lost packet count
	  for the new SSRC - resulting in a very large number of lost
	  packets. This patch modifies res_rtp_asterisk such that, if it
	  detects a SSRC change, it will reset the various values used by
	  the RTCP calculations. From the perspective of RTCP, this appears
	  as a new media stream - which is what it is. Review:

	* /, configure, configure.ac: Add check for openSUSE when detecting
	  bfd library In ASTERISK-17842, some additional library checks
	  were added to the configure script so that the bfd library could
	  be found on CentOS and Fedora systems. As it turns out, openSUSE
	  requires an additional library. This patch adds another check to
	  the configure script for openSUSE that will add that library.

	* main/cdr.c, /: CDR: Improve handling of parking; resolve
	  assertion when originating into park This patch covers two
	  problems: 1) Currently, when a call is transferred into a parking
	  lot from a bridge (using either the blind transfer or one touch
	  parking mechanisms), the application fails to be set to "Park" in
	  the resulting CDR record for the parked channel. This is due to
	  the ParkedCall message arriving before the BridgeEnter for the
	  channel entering the parking bridge. The ParkedCall message isn't
	  handled as the CDR for the channel has already been finalized
	  (due to the channel having left its two party bridge), and the
	  BridgeEnter - which creates the new CDR - doesn't have the
	  parking information. This patch modifies the behavior so that
	  reception of a ParkedCall message will - if not handled by a CDR
	  chain - cause a new CDR to be created and put into the Parking
	  state. 2) It fixes a FRACK that occurred when a channel is
	  originated into a parking space. The DialedPending state - which
	  occurs for both Dialed and Originated channels - assumed that it
	  couldn't handle the parking transitions due to it having a Party
	  B; however, Originated channels don't have a Party B. As such,
	  the existing CDR needs to transition into the parking state -
	  this patch does that. Review:

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: Make manager events tolerant of
	  Local channel shenanigans app_queue currently attempts to handle
	  Local channel optimizations in an effort to provide accurate
	  information in Stasis messages (and their corresponding AMI
	  events) as well as the Queue log. Sometimes, however, things
	  don't go as planned. Consider the following scenario: SIP/foo <->
	  L;1 <-> L;2 <-> SIP/agent SIP/agent answers, triggering a Local
	  channel optimization. app_queue will normally do the following: *
	  Listen for the Local optimization events and update our agent
	  accordingly to SIP/agent in the queue log and messages * When we
	  get a hangup, publish the AgentComplete event based on our
	  information (SIP/foo and SIP/agent) However, as with all things
	  that depend on sanity from something as capricious as Local
	  channels, things can go wrong: (1) SIP/agent immediately hangs up
	  upon answering. This triggers a race condition between
	  termination messages coming from SIP/agent and the ongoing Local
	  channel optimization messages. (Note that this can also occur
	  with SIP/foo) (2) In a race condition, Asterisk can (rarely)
	  deliver the hangup messages prior to the Local channel
	  optimization. In that case, the messages *may* arrive to
	  app_queue in the following order: * Hangup SIP/Agent * Hangup
	  SIP/foo * Optimize L;1/L;2 * Hangup L;2 * Hangup L;1 When
	  app_queue receives the hangup of the agent or the caller, it will
	  attempt to publish the AgentComplete event. However, it now has a
	  problem - it thinks its agent is the ;1 side of the Local
	  channel, as it never received the optimization event. At the same
	  time, that channel is already gone. This results in getting NULL
	  from the Stasis cache. What's more, we can't really wait for the
	  optimization message, as we are currently handling the hangup of
	  the channel that the optimization event would tell us to use.
	  This patch modifies the behavior in app_queue such that, since we
	  still have a lot of pertinent queue information (interface, queue
	  name, etc.), we now raise the event with what information we
	  know. The channels involved now may or may not be present. Users
	  will still at least get the "AgentComplete" event, which
	  "completes" the known Agent information. Review:

	* main/manager.c, /: manager: Fix crash when appending a manager
	  channel variable In r399887, a minor performance improvement was
	  introduced by not allocating the manager variable struct if it
	  wasn't used. Unfortunately, when directly accessing an
	  ast_channel struct, manager assumed that the struct was always
	  allocated. Since this was no longer the case, things got a bit
	  crashy. This fixes that problem by simply bypassing appending
	  variables if the manager channel variable struct isn't there.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Fix Realtime Peer Update
	  Problem When Un-registering And Expires Header In 200ok 1st Issue
	  When a realtime peer sends an un-REGISTER request, Asterisk
	  un-registers the peer but the database table record still has
	  regseconds and fullcontact for the peer. This results in calls
	  attempting to be routed to the peer which is no longer
	  registered. The expected behavior is to get busy/congested when
	  attempting to call an un-registered peer through the dialplan.
	  What was discovered is that we are clearing out the peer's
	  registration in the database in parse_register_contact() when
	  calling expire_register() but then upon returning from
	  parse_register_contact(), update_peer() is run which stores back
	  in the database table regseconds and fullcontact. 2nd Issue The
	  reporter pointed out that the 200 ok being returned by Asterisk
	  after un-registering a peer contains a Contact header with
	  ;expires= and the Expires header is not set to 0. This is
	  actually a regression. Tests were created for this second issue
	  (ASTERISK-22548). The tests have been reviewed and a Ship It! was
	  received on those tests. This patch does the following: * Do not
	  ignore the Expires header value even when it is set to 0. The
	  patch sets the pvt->expiry earlier on in the function so that it
	  is set properly and used. * If pvt->expiry is 0, do not call
	  update_peer since that means the peer has already been
	  un-registered and there is no need to update the database record
	  again since nothing has changed. (closes issue ASTERISK-22428)

	* main/stasis_bridges.c, tests/test_cdr.c, main/cdr.c, /: Fix a
	  performance problem CDRs There is a large performance price
	  currently in the CDR engine. We currently perform two
	  ao2_callback calls on a container that has an entry for every
	  channel in the system. This is done to create matching pairs
	  between channels in a bridge. As such, the portion of the CDR
	  logic that this patch deals with is how we make pairings when a
	  channel enters a mixing bridge. In general, when a channel enters
	  such a bridge, we need to do two things: (1) Figure out if anyone
	  in the bridge can be this channel's Party B. (2) Make pairings
	  with every other channel in the bridge that is not already our
	  Party B. This is a two step process. In the first step, we look
	  through everyone in the bridge and see if they can be our Party B
	  (single_state_process_bridge_enter). If they can - yay! We mark
	  our CDR as having gotten a Party B. If not, we keep searching. If
	  we don't find one, we wait until someone joins who can be our
	  Party B. Step 2 is where we changed the logic
	  (handle_bridge_pairings and bridge_candidate_process).
	  Previously, we would first find candidates - those channels in
	  the bridge with us - from the active_cdrs_by_channel container.
	  Because a channel could be a candidate if it was Party B to an
	  item in the container, the code implemented multiple
	  ao2_container callbacks to get all the candidates. We also had to
	  store them in another container with some other meta information.
	  This was rather complex and costly, particularly if you have 300
	  Local channels (600 channels!) going at once. Luckily, none of it
	  is needed: when a channel enters a bridge (which is when we're
	  figuring all this stuff out), the bridge snapshot tells us the
	  unique IDs of everyone already in the bridge. All we need to do
	  is: For all channels in the bridge: If the channel is us or our
	  Party B that we got in step 1, skip it Compare us and the
	  candidate to figure out who is Party A (based on some specific
	  rules) If we are Party A: Make a new CDR for us, append it to our
	  chain, and set the candidate as Party B If they are Party A: If
	  they don't have a Party B: Make a new CDR for them, append us to
	  their chain, and us as Party B Otherwise: Copy us over as Party B
	  on their existing CDR. This patch does that. Because we now use
	  channel unique IDs to find the candidates during bridging,
	  active_cdrs_by_channel now looks up things using uniqueid instead
	  of channel name. This makes the more complex code simpler; it
	  does, however, have the drawback that dialplan applications and
	  functions will be slightly slower as they have to iterate through
	  the container looking for the CDR by name. That's a small price
	  to pay however as the bridging code will be called a lot more
	  often. This patch also does two other minor changes: (1) It
	  reduces the container size of the channels in a bridge snapshot

	* res/res_pjsip.c, res/res_pjsip_session.c, /: Fix crash in

	  res_pjsip and res_pjsip_session. During load time in res_pjsip if
	  an error occurred the operation would attempt to rollback all
	  operations done during load. This is not permitted by PJSIP as it
	  will assert if the operation has not been done. This fix changes
	  the code so it will only rollback what has been initialized
	  already. Further changes also prevent res_pjsip and
	  res_pjsip_session from being unloaded. This is due to limitations
	  within PJSIP itself. The library environment can only be changed
	  to a certain extent and does not provide the ability, currently,
	  to deinitialize certain required functionality. (closes issue

	* apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c, /: Confbridge: empty
	  conference not being torn down Confbridge would not properly tear
	  down an empty conference bridge when all users were kicked via
	  end_marked=yes and at least one user was also set to wait_marked.
	  This occurred because while end_marked users were being kicked
	  and at least one was also set to wait_marked then the leave
	  wait_marked handler would be called on that user, but there would
	  be no waiting user (still considered active). The waiting users
	  would decrement and now be negative. The conference would remain,
	  but be put into an inactive state. The solution was to move from
	  the active list to the wait list, those users with wait_marked
	  set right before kicking. This allows both the active and wait
	  users to decrement correctly and the confbridge to tear down
	  properly. A crashed also occurred when trying to list the
	  specific conference from the CLI. This happened because the
	  conference specified was invalid. Since the conference properly
	  tears down now there is no way to reference it thus alleviating
	  the crash as well. (closes issue ASTERISK-21859) Reported by:

	  Asterisk logging This patch uses PJSIP's pj_log_set_log_func() to
	  forward PJSIP's log messages to Asterisk's logger. This is done
	  in a new module: res_pjsip_log_forwarder.so. This patch sets
	  defaultenabled on the existing res_pjsip_logger.so to no, since
	  logging every SIP packet seems a bit odd to do by default, and is
	  (hopefully) less necessary with regular PJSIP logging. It also
	  removes res_rtp_asterisk's disabling of PJSIP logging. (closes

	* /, res/res_http_websocket.c: ARI: Fix WebSocket response when

	  /ws to /ari/events, I added code to allow a WebSocket to connect
	  without specifying the subprotocol if there's only one
	  subprotocol handler registered for the WebSocket. Naively, I
	  coded it to always respond with the subprotocol in use.
	  Unfortunately, according to RFC 6455, if the server's response
	  includes a subprotocol header field that "indicates the use of a
	  subprotocol that was not present in the client's handshake [...],
	  the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.", emphasis
	  theirs. This patch correctly omits the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol if
	  one is not specified by the client. (closes issue ASTERISK-22441)

	  that party id allocated memory strings are somehow getting
	  corrupted in the bridge_reconfigured_connected_line_update()
	  function. The invalid string values happen to be the freed memory
	  fill pattern. After much puzzling, I deduced that the

	  out of the source channel's caller party id struct just as
	  another thread is updating it with a new value. The copying
	  thread is using the old string pointer being freed by the
	  updating thread. A search of the code found the
	  unreal_colp_redirect_indicate() routine updating the caller party
	  id's without holding the channel lock. A latent bug in v1.8 and
	  v11 hatched in v12 because of the bridging and connected line

	* /, main/utils.c, include/asterisk/lock.h, main/lock.c: Fix
	  DEBUG_THREADS when lock is acquired in __constructor__ This patch
	  fixes some long-standing bugs in debug threads that were
	  exacerbated with recent Optional API work in Asterisk 12. With
	  debug threads enabled, on some systems, there's a lock ordering
	  problem between our mutex and glibc's mutex protecting its module
	  list (Ubuntu Lucid, glibc 2.11.1 in this instance). In one
	  thread, the module list will be locked before acquiring our
	  mutex. In another thread, our mutex will be locked before locking
	  the module list (which happens in the depths of calling
	  backtrace()). This patch fixes this issue by moving backtrace()
	  calls outside of critical sections that have the mutex acquired.
	  The bigger change was to reentrancy tracking for
	  ast_cond_{timed,}wait, which wrongly assumed that waiting on the
	  mutex was equivalent to a single unlock (it actually suspends all
	  recursive locks on the mutex). (closes issue ASTERISK-22455)

	* /, res/res_xmpp.c: Prevent XMPP timeout on blank responses
	  Sometimes the Google Voice servers have a bad habit of sending
	  out 1 byte replies to the xmpp resource. When a blank 1 byte
	  reply is received from the socket the buffer attempts to wait
	  (endlessly) for the rest of the reply from google which
	  effectively blocks the socket and google voice calls will no
	  longer come into the server. This patch allows the xmpp module to
	  correctly detect empty packets and send out ping replies to
	  google. It also sets a socket timeout on the default socket which
	  prevents the xmpp socket from closing and preventing future
	  google voice calls from coming into the server. Furthermore
	  instead of sending an empty reply back to google we send a proper
	  xmpp ping reply back. This also adds several more socket
	  messages. (closes issue ASTERISK-22347) Reported by: Andrew Nagy

	  optional_api: Fix linking problems between modules that export
	  global symbols With the new work in Asterisk 12, there are some
	  uses of the optional_api that are prone to failure. The details
	  are rather involved, and captured on [the wiki][1]. This patch
	  addresses the issue by removing almost all of the magic from the
	  optional API implementation. Instead of relying on weak symbol
	  resolution, a new optional_api.c module was added to Asterisk
	  core. For modules providing an optional API, the pointer to the
	  implementation function is registered with the core. For modules
	  that use an optional API, a pointer to a stub function, along
	  with a optional_ref function pointer are registered with the
	  core. The optional_ref function pointers is set to the
	  implementation function when it's provided, or the stub function
	  when it's now. Since the implementation no longer relies on
	  magic, it is now supported on all platforms. In the spirit of
	  choice, an OPTIONAL_API flag was added, so we can disable the
	  optional_api if needed (maybe it's buggy on some bizarre platform
	  I haven't tested on) The AST_OPTIONAL_API*() macros themselves
	  remained unchanged, so existing code could remain unchanged. But
	  to help with debugging the optional_api, the patch limits the
	  #include of optional API's to just the modules using the API.
	  This also reduces resource waste maintaining optional_ref
	  pointers that aren't used. Other changes made as a part of this
	  patch: * The stubs for http_websocket that wrap system calls set
	  errno to ENOSYS. * res_http_websocket now properly increments
	  module use count. * In loader.c, the while() wrappers around
	  dlclose() were removed. The while(!dlclose()) is actually an
	  anti-pattern, which can lead to infinite loops if the module
	  you're attempting to unload exports a symbol that was directly
	  linked to. * The special handling of nonoptreq on systems without
	  weak symbol support was removed, since we no longer rely on weak
	  symbols for optional_api. [1]:

	  his patch implements the ARI API's for stored recordings. While
	  the original task only specified deleting a recording, it was
	  simple enough to implement the GET for all recordings, and for an
	  individual recording. The recording playback operation was
	  modified to use the same code for accessing the recording as the
	  REST API, so that they will behave consistently. There were
	  several problems with the api-docs that were also fixed, bringing
	  the ARI spec in line with the implementation. There were some
	  'wishful thinking' fields on the stored recording model (duration
	  and timestamp) that were removed, because I ended up not
	  implementing a metadata file to go along with the recording to
	  store such information. The GET /recordings/live operation was
	  removed, since it's not really that useful to get a list of all
	  recordings that are currently going on in the system. (At least,
	  if we did that, we'd probably want to also list all of the
	  current playbacks. Which seems weird.) (closes issue

	* /, res/res_pjsip_pubsub.c: Fix when the subscription_terminated
	  callback is called for subscription handlers. The previous
	  placement would result in the resubscribe() callback called
	  instead of the subscription_terminated() callback being called
	  when a subscription was ended via a SUBSCRIBE request. This would
	  result in confusing PJSIP and having it throw an assertion.

	* res/res_pjsip_session.c, /: Fix a race condition where a canceled
	  call was answered. RFC 5407 section 3.1.2 details a scenario
	  where a UAC sends a CANCEL at the same time that a UAS sends a
	  200 OK for the INVITE that the UAC is canceling. When this
	  occurs, it is the role of the UAC to immediately send a BYE to
	  terminate the call. This scenario was reproducible by have a
	  Digium phone with two lines place a call to a second phone that
	  forwarded the call to the second line on the original phone. The
	  Digium phone, upon realizing that it was connecting to itself,
	  would attempt to cancel the call. The timing of this happened to
	  trigger the aforementioned race condition about 80% of the time.
	  Asterisk was not doing its job of sending a BYE when receiving a
	  200 OK on a cancelled INVITE. The result was that the ast_channel
	  structure was destroyed but the underlying SIP session, as well
	  as the PJSIP inv_session and dialog, were still alive. Attempting
	  to perform an action such as a transfer, once in this state,
	  would result in Asterisk crashing. The circumstances are now
	  detected properly and the session is ended as recommended in RFC
	  5407. (closes issue AST-1209) reported by John Bigelow ........

	* /, res/res_pjsip_refer.c: Improve detection of answer on SIP
	  blind transfer. A problem encountered during testing was that
	  res_pjsip_refer would not ever send a NOTIFY with a 200 OK
	  sipfrag. This is because the framehook that was supposed to send
	  the NOTIFY would never be told that an answer had occurred. This
	  happened for two reasons: 1) The transferee channel on which the
	  framehook was on was already up. 2) Answers are rarely if ever
	  written to channels. Rather, the ast_answer() or ast_raw_answer()
	  function is used to answer channels. Thanks to a suggestion by
	  Matt Jordan, the best way to detect that the call had been
	  answered was to find out when the transferee channel joined a
	  bridge. With stasis this is an easy task. So now, in addition to
	  the framehook logic, there is a stasis subscription used to
	  determine when the transferee has entered a bridge. Once it has
	  entered, an appropriate NOTIFY is sent. ........ Merged revisions

	* res/res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c, /: Fix dialog matching in the
	  SIP distributor. Dialog matching is performed in the distributor
	  for the sole purpose of retrieving an associated serializer so
	  the request may be serialized. This patch fixes two problems.
	  First, incoming CANCEL requests that had no to-tag (which really
	  should be *all* CANCEL requests) would not match with a dialog.
	  An earlier bug fix to deal with early CANCEL requests would
	  result in the CANCEL being replied to with a 481. The fix for
	  this is to find the matching INVITE transaction and get the
	  dialog from that transaction. Second, no SIP responses were
	  matching dialogs. This is because we were inverting the tags that
	  we were passing into PJSIP's dialog finding function. This logic
	  has been corrected by setting local and remote tag variables
	  based on whether the incoming message is a request or response.

	  cleanup Stasis events (which get distributed over the ARI
	  WebSocket) are created by subscribing to the channel_all_cached
	  and bridge_all_cached topics, filtering out events for
	  channels/bridges currently subscribed to. There are two issues
	  with that. First was a race condition, where messages in-flight
	  to the master subscribe-to-all-things topic would get sent out,
	  even though the events happened before the channel was put into
	  Stasis. Secondly, as the number of channels and bridges grow in
	  the system, the work spent filtering messages becomes excessive.
	  Since r395954, individual channels and bridges have caching
	  topics, and can be subscribed to individually. This patch takes
	  advantage, so that channels and bridges are subscribed to on
	  demand, instead of filtering the global topics. The one case
	  where filtering is still required is handling BridgeMerge
	  messages, which are published directly to the bridge_all topic.
	  Other than the change to how subscriptions work, this patch
	  mostly just moves code around. Most of the work generating JSON
	  objects from messages was moved to .to_json handlers on the
	  message types. The callback functions handling app subscriptions
	  were moved from res_stasis (b/c they were global to the model) to
	  stasis/app.c (b/c they are local to the app now). (closes issue

	* /, main/bridge_channel.c: Better handle clearing the OUTGOING
	  flag when a channel leaves a bridge When a channel with the
	  OUTGOING flag leaves a bridge, and it will survive being pulled
	  from the bridge (either because it will execute dialplan, go into
	  another bridge, or live in a friendly autoloop), we have to clear
	  the OUTGOING flag. This is the signal to the CDR engine that this
	  channel is no longer a second class citizen, i.e., it is not
	  "dialed". The soft hangup flags are only half the picture. If a
	  channel is being moved from one bridge to another, the soft
	  hangup flags aren't set; however, the state of the bridge_channel
	  will not be hung up. Since the channel does not have one of the
	  two hang up states, that implies that the channel is still
	  technically alive. This patch modifies the check so that it
	  checks both the soft hangup flags as well as the bridge_channel
	  state. If either suggests that the channel is going to persist,
	  we clear the OUTGOING flag. ........ Merged revisions 397690 from
