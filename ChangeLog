	Fix regression that changed behavior of queues when ringing a queue
	member.

	This reverts r298596, which was to fix a highly bizarre and contrived
	issue with a queue member that called into his own queue being 
	transferred back into his own queue. I couldn't reproduce that issue in 
	any way. I think one of the other recent transfer fixes actually fixed 
	this.

	main/features: Use POLLPRI when waiting for events on parked channels.

	This change resolves a regression in the 1.6.2 when converting from
	select to poll. The DAHDI timers use POLLPRI to indicate that the
	timer
	fired, but features was not waiting for that flag. The result was no
	audio for MOH when a call was parked and res_timing_dahdi was in use.

	This patch is slightly modified from the one on the mantis issue. It
	does
	not set an exception on the channel if the POLLPRI flag is set.

	Resolve a memory leak with the manager interface is disabled.

	The intent of this check as it stands in previous versions of Asterisk
	was to
	check if there are any active sessions.  If there were no sessions,
	then the
	function would return immediately and not bother with queueing up the
	manager
	event to be processed.  Since the conversion of storing sessions in an
	astobj2
	container, this check will always pass.  I changed it to go back to
	checking
	what was intended.

	The side effect of this was that if the AMI is disabled, the manager
	event
	queue is populated anyway, but the code that runs to clear out the
	queue
	never runs.  A producer with no consumer is a bad thing.

	Reported internally by kmorgan.

	  | 88 lines Issues with DTMF triggered attended transfers. Issue
	  #17999 1) A calls B. B answers. 2) B using DTMF dial *2 (code in
	  features.conf for attended transfer). 3) A hears MOH. B dial
	  number C 4) C ringing. A hears MOH. 5) B hangup. A still hears
	  MOH. C ringing. 6) A hangup. C still ringing until
	  "atxfernoanswertimeout" expires. For v1.4 C will ring forever
	  until C answers the dead line. (Issue #17096) Problem: When A and
	  B hangup, C is still ringing. Issue #18395 SIP call limit of B is
	  1 1. A call B, B answered 2. B *2(atxfer) call C 3. B hangup, C
	  ringing 4. Timeout waiting for C to answer 5. Recall to B fails
	  because B has reached its call limit. Because B reached its call
	  limit, it cannot do anything until the transfer it started
	  completes. Issue #17273 Same scenario as issue 18395 but party B
	  is an FXS port. Party B cannot do anything until the transfer it
	  started completes. If B goes back off hook before C answers, B
	  hears ringback instead of the expected dialtone. ********** Note
	  for the issue #17273 and #18395 fix: DTMF attended transfer works
	  within the channel bridge. Unfortunately, when either party A or
	  B in the channel bridge hangs up, that channel is not completely
	  hung up until the transfer completes. This is a real problem
	  depending upon the channel technology involved. For chan_dahdi,
	  the channel is crippled until the hangup is complete. Either the
	  channel is not useable (analog) or the protocol disconnect
	  messages are held up (PRI/BRI/SS7) and the media is not released.
	  For chan_sip, a call limit of one is going to block that endpoint
	  from any further calls until the hangup is complete. For party A
	  this is a minor problem. The party A channel will only be in this
	  condition while party B is dialing and when party B and C are
	  conferring. The conversation between party B and C is expected to
	  be a short one. Party B is either asking a question of party C or
	  announcing party A. Also party A does not have much incentive to
	  hangup at this point. For party B this can be a major problem
	  during a blonde transfer. (A blonde transfer is our term for an
	  attended transfer that is converted into a blind transfer. :))
	  Party B could be the operator. When party B hangs up, he assumes
	  that he is out of the original call entirely. The party B channel
	  will be in this condition while party C is ringing, while
	  attempting to recall party B, and while waiting between call
	  attempts. WARNING: The ATXFER_NULL_TECH conditional is a hack to
	  fix the problem. It will replace the party B channel technology
	  with a NULL channel driver to complete hanging up the party B
	  channel technology. The consequences of this code is that the 'h'
	  extension will not be able to access any channel technology
	  specific information like SIP statistics for the call.
	  ATXFER_NULL_TECH is not defined by default. ********** (closes

	* channels/sig_pri.c: Deadlock between dahdi_request() and
	  pri_dchannel() processing an incomming call. The
	  sig_pri_new_ast_channel() is called with the channel private lock
	  held when pri_dchannel() calls it and no channel private lock
	  held when dahdi_request() calls it. The use of pri_grab() in
	  sig_pri_new_ast_channel() could leave the channel private lock
	  held when it returns if the lock was not held before calling it.
	  Make sig_pri_new_ast_channel() just lock the PRI span lock
	  instead of using pri_grab(). It is safe to do this because
	  dahdi_request() does not have the channel private lock and the
	  deadlock potential with the PRI span lock is only between
	  pri_dchannel() and other threads.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve deadlock involving REFER. Two fixes:
	  1) One must always have the private unlocked before calling
	  pbx_builtin_setvar_helper to not invalidate locking order since
	  it locks the channel. 2) Unlock the channel before calling
	  pbx_find_extension, which starts and stops autoservice during the
	  lookup. The problem scenario as illustrated by the reporter:
	  Thread: do_monitor ----------------------- handle_request_do
	  handle_incoming handle_request_refer ast_parking_ext_valid
	  pbx_find_extension ast_autoservice_stop while (chan_list_state ==
	  as_chan_list_state) { usleep(1000); } Thread: autoservice_run
	  ----------------------- autoservice_run chan = ast_waitfor_n
	  ast_waitfor_nandfds ast_waitfor_nandfds_classic / simple /
	  complex (depending on your system) ast_channel_lock(c[x]);
	  handle_request_do and schedule_process_request_queue locks the
	  owner if it exists. The autoservice thread is waiting for the
	  channel lock, which wasn't ever released since the do_monitor
	  thread was waiting for autoservice operations to complete. Solved
	  by unlocking the channel but keeping a reference to guarantee
	  safety. (closes issue #18403) Reported by: jthurman Patches:

	  | 23 lines Fix not stopping MOH when transfered local channel
	  queue member is answered. The problem here is only present when
	  local channels are used with the MOH passthru option as well as
	  no optimization (/nm). I will describe the slightly bizarre
	  scenario that was used to test, where phones B and C are queue
	  members: Phone A dials into a queue with two members using local
	  channels and the above options. Phone B answers. Phone A blind
	  transfers phone B into the same queue. Phone A hangs up. Phone C
	  answers, but phone B didn't stop playing MOH. In this scenario,
	  the unhold frame that should have gotten to phone B never arrived
	  due to the masquerade from the blind transfer. This is usually
	  fine since app_queue manages the starting and stopping of MOH.
	  However, with the passthrough option enabled when app_queue
	  attempts to stop MOH it tries to do so on the local channel
	  rather than the real channel. The easiest solution was to just
	  make sure to send an unhold frame during the transfer since it
	  wouldn't make sense to have MOH playing after a transfer anyway.
	  This only modifies SIP transfers, but the other transfers did not
	  seem to be a problem. If DTMF based transfers were a problem it
	  might be okay to add ast_moh_stop to finishup, but I didn't want
	  to have to add that unless required. ABE-2624 ........

	  | 43 lines Oneway audio to SIP phone from FXS port after FXS port
	  gets a CallWaiting pip. The FXS connected phone has to have
	  CW/CID support to fail, as it will send back a DTMF 'A' or 'D'
	  when it's ready to receive CallerID. A normal phone with no CID
	  never fails. Also the SIP phone does not hear MOH when the CW
	  call is answered. The DTMF end frame is suppressed when the phone
	  acknowledges the CW signal for CID. The problem is the DTMF begin
	  frame needs to be suppressed as well. The DTMF begin frame is
	  causing SIP to start sending the DTMF RTP frames. Since the DTMF
	  end frame is suppressed, SIP will not stop sending those DTMF RTP
	  packets. * Suppress the DTMF begin and end frames when the

	  CW call while it is sending the CID spill. * Fixed not sending

	  (Fixed by not using native bridge if CW/CID is possible.) *

	  | 38 lines Handle failures building translation paths more
	  effectively. The problem scenario occurred on a heavily loaded
	  system that was using the codec_dahdi module and exceeded the
	  hardware transcoding capacity. The failure mode at that point was
	  not good. The report came in to us as an Asterisk lock-up. The
	  "core show locks" shows a ton of threads locked up (but no
	  obvious deadlock). Upon deeper investigation, when the system is
	  in this state, the CPU was maxed out. The CPU was being consumed
	  by the Asterisk logger spewing messages on every audio frame for
	  calls set up after transcoder capacity was reached. The purpose
	  of this patch is to make Asterisk handle failures to create a
	  translation path in a more graceful manner. If we can't
	  translate, then the call just needs to be dropped, as it's not
	  going to work. These are the changes: 1) In set_format() of
	  channel.c (which is called by set_read_format() and
	  set_write_format()), it was ignoring if
	  ast_translator_build_path() failed and returned NULL. It now pays
	  attention to that case and returns a result reflecting failure.
	  With this change in place, the bridging code will immediately
	  detect a failure and end the bridge instead of proceeding to try
	  to bridge frames that can't be translated and making channel
	  drivers freak out by sending them frames in a format they weren't
	  expecting. 2) In ast_indicate_data() of channel.c, failure of
	  ast_playtones_start() was ignored. It is now reflected in the
	  return value of the function. This didn't turn out to have any
	  affect on the bug, but seemed like a good change to leave in. 3)
	  In app_dial(), when only sending a call to a single endpoint, it
	  will attempt to do some bridging of its own of early audio. It
	  uses make_compatible() when it's going to do this. However, it
	  ignored failure from make compatible. So, even with the fix from
	  #1, if there was early audio going through app_dial, there would
	  still be a period of invalid frames passing through. After
	  detecting failure here, Dial() exits. ABE-2658 ........

	  the call instead of redirecting the call. To recreate the
	  problem: 1) Party A calls Party B 2) Invoke CLI "channel
	  redirect" command to redirect channel call leg associated with A.
	  3) All associated channels are hung up. Note that if the CLI
	  command were done on the channel call leg associated with B it
	  works. This regression was a result of the fix for issue #16946
	  (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/740/). The regression affects
	  all features that use an async goto to execute the dialplan
	  because of an external event: Channel redirect, AMI redirect, SIP
	  REFER, and FAX detection. The struct ast_channel._softhangup code
	  is a mess. The variable is used for several purposes that do not

	  doxygen comments to describe how the various _softhangup bits are
	  used. I have corrected all the places where the variable was
	  tested in a non-bit oriented manner. The primary fix is the new
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q frame. It acts as a weak hangup request so

	  | 29 lines Fix cache of device state changes for multiple
	  servers. This patch addresses a regression where device states
	  across multiple servers were not being processing completely
	  correctly. The code works to determine the overall state by
	  looking at the last known state of a device on each server.
	  However, there was a regression due to some invasive rewrites of
	  how the cache works that led to the cache only storing the last
	  device state change for a device, regardless of which server it
	  was on. The code is set up to cache device state change events by
	  ensuring that each event in the cache has a unique device name +
	  entity ID (server ID). The code that was responsible for
	  comparing raw information elements (which EID is) always returned
	  a match due to a memcmp() with a length of 0. There isn't much
	  code to fix the actual bug. This patch also introduces a new CLI
	  command that was very useful for debugging this problem. The
	  command allows you to dump the contents of the event cache.

	  | 18 lines Fix problem with qualify option packets for realtime
	  peers never stopping. The option packets not only never stopped,
	  but if a realtime peer was not in the peer list multiple options
	  dialogs could accumulate over time. This scenario has the
	  potential to progress to the point of saturating a link just from
	  options packets. The fix was to ensure that the poke scheduler
	  checks to see if a peer is in the peer list before continuing to
	  poke. The reason a peer must be in the peer list to be able to
	  properly manage an options dialog is because otherwise the call
	  pointer is lost when the peer is regenerated from the database,
	  which is how existing qualify dialogs are detected. (closes issue

	  | 47 lines Fix a deadlock in device state change processing.
	  Copied from some notes from the original author (Russell):
	  Deadlock scenario: Thread 1: device state change thread Holds -
	  rdlock on contexts Holds - hints lock Waiting on channels
	  container lock Thread 2: SIP monitor thread Holds the "iflock"
	  Holds a sip_pvt lock Holds channel container lock Waiting for a
	  channel lock Thread 3: A channel thread (chan_local in this case)
	  Holds 2 channel locks acquired within app_dial Holds a 3rd
	  channel lock it got inside of chan_local Holds a local_pvt lock
	  Waiting on a rdlock of the contexts lock A bunch of other threads
	  waiting on a wrlock of the contexts lock To address this
	  deadlock, some locking order rules must be put in place and
	  enforced. Existing relevant rules: 1) channel lock before a pvt
	  lock 2) contexts lock before hints lock 3) channels container
	  before a channel What's missing is some enforcement of the order
	  when you involve more than any two. To fix this problem, I put in
	  some code that ensures that (at least in the code paths involved
	  in this bug) the locks in (3) come before the locks in (2). To
	  change the operation of thread 1 to comply, I converted the
	  storage of hints to an astobj2 container. This allows processing
	  of hints without holding the hints container lock. So, in the
	  code path that led to thread 1's state, it no longer holds either
	  the contexts or hints lock while it attempts to lock the channels
	  container. (closes issue #18165) Reported by: antonio ABE-2583

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: valgrind reported references to freed

	  happening in chan_misdn because the chan_misdn channel private
	  struct chan_list is not protected from reentrancy. Hangup
	  collisions have be causing read and write accesses to freed
	  memory. Converted chan_misdn struct chan_list to an ao2 object
	  for its reference counting feature. ********** Removed an
	  impediment to converting chan_list to an ao2 object. The use of
	  the other_ch member in chan_list is shaky at best. It is set if
	  the incoming and outgoing call legs are mISDN. The use of the
	  other_ch member goes against the Asterisk architecture and can
	  even cause problems. 1) It is used to disable echo cancellation.
	  This could be bad if the call is forked and the winning call leg
	  is not mISDN or the winning call leg is not the last mISDN
	  channel called by the fork. The other_ch would become a dangling
	  pointer. 2) It is used when the far end is alerting to hear the
	  far end's inband audio instead of Asterisk's generated ringback
	  tone. This is bad if the call is forked. You would only hear the
	  last forked mISDN channel and it may not be ringing yet. The
	  other_ch would become a dangling pointer if the call is later
	  transferred. ********** JIRA SWP-2423 JIRA ABE-2614

	  number of samples was in each read. In other words, each packet
	  your provider sent you, regardless of size, would result in 20 ms
	  of decoded data (30 ms if decoding G723). If your provider was
	  sending 60 ms packets then codec_dahdi would end up stripping 40
	  ms of data from each transcoded frame resulting in "choppy"

	* include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h, main/rtp_engine.c,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: Avoid valgrind warnings for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_xxx_address The documentation for
	  ast_rtp_instance_get_(local/remote)_address stated that they
	  returned 0 for success and -1 on failure. Instead, they returned
	  0 if the address structure passed in was already equivalent to
	  the address instance local/remote address or 1 otherwise. 90% of
	  the calls to these functions completely ignored the return
	  address and passed in an uninitialized struct, which would make
	  valgrind complain even though the operation was technically safe.
	  This patch fixes the documentation and converts the
	  get_xxx_address functions to void since all they really do is
	  copy the address and cannot fail. Additionally two new functions
	  (ast_rtp_instance_get_and_cmp_(local/remote)_address) are created
	  for the 3 times where the return value was actually checked. The
	  get_and_cmp_local_address function is currently unused, but
	  exists for the sake of symmetry. The only functional change as a
	  result of this change is that we will not do an
	  ast_sockaddr_cmp() on (mostly uninitialized) addresses before
	  doing the ast_sockaddr_copy() in the get_*_address functions. So,
	  even though it is an API change, it shouldn't have a noticeable
	  change in behavior. Review:

	  | 29 lines Fix inprocess_container in voicemail to correctly
	  restrict max messages. The comparison function logic was off, so
	  the number of sessions for a given mailbox were not being
	  incremented properly. This problem caused the maximum number of
	  messages per folder to not be respected when simultaneously
	  leaving multiple voicemails just below the threshold. These
	  problems should be fixed by the above, but just in case: Fixed
	  resequence_mailbox to rely on the actual number of detected
	  number of files in a directory rather than just assuming only 10
	  messages more than the maximum had been left. Also if more
	  messages than the maximum are deleted they are actually removed
	  now. The second purpose of this commit should have been separated
	  out probably, but is related to the above. Again, if the number
	  of messages in a given voicemail folder exceeds the maximum set
	  limit make sure to allocate enough space for the deleted and
	  heard index tracking array. A few random fixes: There was a
	  forgotten decrement of the inprocess count in imap_store_file.
	  When using IMAP storage, do not look in the directory where file
	  based storage messages may still reside and influence the message
	  count. Ensure to use only the first format in sendmail. ABE-2516

	  | 27 lines This patch turns chan_local pvts into astobj2 objects.
	  chan_local does some dangerous things involving deadlock
	  avoidance. tech_pvt functions like hangup and queue_frame are
	  provided with a locked channel upon entry. Those functions are
	  completely safe as long as you don't attempt to give up that
	  channel lock, but that is impossible to guarantee due to the
	  required deadlock avoidance necessary to lock both the tech_pvt
	  and both channels involved. In the past, we have tried to account
	  for this by doing things like setting a "glare" flag that
	  indicates what function should destroy the pvt. This was used in
	  local_hangup and local_queue_frame to decided who should destroy
	  the pvt if they collided in separate threads. I have removed the
	  need to do this by converting all chan_local tech_pvts to
	  astobj2. This means we can ref a pvt before deadlock avoidance
	  and not have to worry about that pvt possibly getting destroyed
	  under us. It also cleans up where we destroy the tech_pvt. The
	  only unlink from the tech_pvt container occurs in local_hangup
	  now, which is where it should occur. Since there still may be
	  thread collisions on some functions like local_hangup after
	  deadlock avoidance, I have added some checks to detect those
	  collisions and exit appropriately. I think this patch is going to
	  solve quite a bit of weirdness we have had with local channels in
	  the past. ........ ................

	* tests/test_event.c: Prevent multiple runs of event_sub_test from

	  was declared "static," meaning that the data.count field would

	* contrib/scripts/ast_tls_cert (added): Add TLS cert helper script
	  This script is useful for quickly generating self-signed CA,
	  server, and client certificates for use with Asterisk. It is
	  still recommended to obtain certificates from a recognized
	  Certificate Authority and to develop an understanding how SSL
	  certificates work. Real security is hard work. OPTIONS: -h Show
	  this message -m Type of cert "client" or "server". Defaults to
	  server. -f Config filename (openssl config file format) -c CA
	  cert filename (creates new CA cert/key as ca.crt/ca.key if not
	  passed) -k CA key filename -C Common name (cert field) For a
	  server cert, this should be the same address that clients attempt
	  to connect to. Usually this will be the Fully Qualified Domain
	  Name, but might be the IP of the server. For a CA or client cert,
	  it is merely informational. Make sure your certs have unique
	  common names. -O Org name (cert field) An informational string
	  (company name) -o Output filename base (defaults to asterisk) -d
	  Output directory (defaults to the current directory) Example: To
	  create a CA and a server (pbx.mycompany.com) cert with output in
	  /tmp: ast_tls_cert -C pbx.mycompany.com -O "My Company" -d /tmp
	  This will create a CA cert and key as well as asterisk.pem and
	  the the two files that it is made from: asterisk.crt and
	  asterisk.key. Copy asterisk.pem and ca.crt somewhere (like
	  /etc/asterisk) and set tlscertfile=/etc/asterisk.pem and
	  tlscafile=/etc/ca.crt. Since this is a self-signed key, many
	  devices will require you to import the ca.crt file as a trusted
	  cert. To create a client cert using the CA cert created by the
	  example above: ast_tls_cert -m client -c /tmp/ca.crt -k
	  /tmp/ca.key -C "Joe User" -O \ "My Company" -d /tmp -o joe_user
	  This will create client.crt/key/pem in /tmp. Use this if your
	  device supports a client certificate. Make sure that you have the
	  ca.crt file set up as a tlscafile in the necessary Asterisk
	  configs. Make backups of all .key files in case you need them
	  later.

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Safer xml parsing, treat all clients the
	  same, and better local candidate selection. The gtalk channel
	  driver was doing several unsafe operations in regards to how it
	  parsed incoming XML messages. I have cleaned that code up so it
	  should be much safer now. We now treat all clients types the
	  same. We have no reason to distinguish between GMAIL and GOOGLE
	  VOICE clients anymore because they all work the same way. I also
	  modified how the local ip is found. If no bindaddress is provided
	  in the config file, we attempt to determine the local ip we would
	  use to connect to google.com. If that fails, then we fall back to
	  the ast_find_ourip() function as a last resort. Using the new
	  method makes it much less likely that we would ever advertise a
	  local RTP candidate as a loopback address.

	  softhangup'd When an outgoing call is answered and hung up by the
	  far end *very* quickly, we may not read any frames and therefor
	  end up with a call that displays the wrong
	  disposition/DIALSTATUS. The reason is because ast_queue_hangup()
	  immediately sets the _softhangup flag on the channel and then
	  queues the HANGUP control frame, but __ast_read refuses to read
	  any frames if ast_check_hangup() indicates that a hangup request
	  has been made (which it will if _softhangup is set). So, we end
	  up losing control frames. This change makes __ast_read continue
	  to read frames even if a soft hangup has been requested. It
	  queues a hangup frame to make sure that __ast_read() will still
	  eventually return NULL. Much thanks to David Vossel for all of

	* main/manager.c: Fixes manager.c crash. This issue was caused by
	  improper use of the mansession lock and manession_session lock.
	  These two structures are confusing to begin with so I'm not
	  surprised this occurred. I fixed this by consistently making sure
	  we use each of these locks only to protect the data in the
	  corresponding structure. We had mismatched usage of these locks
	  which resulted in no mutual exclusivity occurring at all. (closes
	  issue #17994) Reported by: vrban Patches:

	* CHANGES: Update CHANGES to reflect new gtalk.conf options.

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c, include/asterisk/stun.h,
	  configs/gtalk.conf.sample, res/res_stun_monitor.c: Gtalk
	  enhancements and general code cleanup. This patch includes
	  several chan_gtalk enhancements. Two new gtalk.conf options have
	  been added, externip and stunadd. Setting externip allows us to
	  manually specify what the external IP address is outside of a NAT
	  environment. Setting the stunaddr option to a valid stun server
	  allows for that external ip to be retrieved via a STUN server
	  automatically. This external IP is then advertised during call
	  setup as a possible candidate. I have also attempted to clean up
	  chan_gtalk's code so it meets our coding guidelines. During this
	  cleanup I noticed several things that need to be done in the code
	  and made a TODO section at the top of the file.

	  Setting the module/filename specific message level and then
	  changing it resulted in the linked list being looped on itself.
	  Traversing this linked list is an infinite loop if what you are
	  looking for is not in the list. Also plugged some CLI parsing
	  holes in the associated CLI command: * Removing a nonexistent
	  module from the list actually added it with a level of zero. *
	  Setting the non-module specific level to zero is now equivalent
	  to setting it to "off" as documented. ........

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Fixes commented out code to use #if 0
	  instead. Thanks to rmudgett for catching this!

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Fixes gtalk outbound DTMF to work
	  properly. Outbound DTMF with gtalk needs to be done within the
	  RTP stream. I discovered this after investigating a packet
	  capture from the gmail client. Instead of performing jingle
	  signaling DTMF, the gtalk servers expect all DTMF to arrive on
	  the RTP stream using RFC2833 way of doing things. Chan_gtalk also
	  had an issue with negotiating RTP payload type 106 for the
	  telephony-event and then sending DTMF as payload 101. This has
	  been resolved by always negotiating 101 as the payload type like
	  we do everywhere else. With this patch, incoming google voice
	  calls forwarded to Asterisk via gtalk work.

	  interception macros.

	* apps/app_queue.c, apps/app_dial.c: Simplify locking code for
	  REDIRECTING interception macro when forwarding a call. Simplified
	  the locking code by using a local copy of the redirecting party
	  information in app_dial.c:do_forward() and
	  app_queue.c:wait_for_answer() for launching the REDIRECTING
	  interception macro when a call is forwarded. Reduced the lock

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, CHANGES, include/asterisk/framehook.h
	  (added), main/channel.c, main/framehook.c (added),
	  funcs/func_frame_trace.c (added): Addition of the FrameHook API
	  (AKA AwesomeHooks) So far all our tools for viewing and
	  manipulating media streams within Asterisk have been entirely
	  focused on audio. That made sense then, but is not scalable now.
	  The FrameHook API lets us tap into and manipulate _ANY_ type of
	  media or signaling passed on a channel present today or in the
	  future. This tool is a step in the direction of expanding
	  Asterisk's boundaries and will help generate some rather
	  interesting applications in the future. In addition to the
	  FrameHook API, a simple dialplan function exercising the api has
	  been included as well. This function is called FRAME_TRACE().
	  FRAME_TRACE() allows for the internal ast_frames read and written
	  to a channel to be output. Filters can be placed on this function
	  to debug only certain types of frames. This function could be
	  thought of as an internal way of doing ast_frame packet captures.

	  unfortunately can handle these information elements only in a

	  frames on channels that were in the UP state. This modification
	  prevented bridges that were up before the answer from being
	  broken and reestablished by an ANSWER control frame. That change
	  also prevents pickup of channels called from the ast_dial
	  framework from working properly. The ast_dial framework expects
	  to see an ANSWER frame after dialing and the pickup code queues
	  one but ast_read() drops it. This new change only drops ANSWER
	  frames when the channel is bridged, allowing the answer queued by

	  | 54 lines Fixes interoperability problems with session timer
	  behavior in Asterisk. CHANGES: 1. Never put "timer" in "Require"
	  header. This is not to our benefit and RFC 4028 section 7.1 even
	  warns against it. It is possible for one endpoint to perform
	  session-timer refreshes while the other endpoint does not support
	  them. If in this case the end point performing the refreshing
	  puts "timer" in the Require field during a refresh, the dialog
	  will likely get terminated by the other end. 2. Change the
	  behavior of 'session-timer=accept' in sip.conf (which is the
	  default behavior of Asterisk with no session timer configuration
	  specified) to only run session-timers as result of an incoming
	  INVITE request if the INVITE contains an "Session-Expires"
	  header... Asterisk is currently treating having the "timer"
	  option in the "Supported" header as a request for session timers
	  by the UAC. I do not agree with this. Session timers should only
	  be negotiated in "accept" mode when the incoming INVITE supplies
	  a "Session-Expires" header, otherwise RFC 4028 says we should
	  treat a request containing no "Session-Expires" header as a
	  session with no expiration. Below I have outlined some situations
	  and what Asterisk's behavior is. The table reflects the behavior
	  changes implemented by this patch. SITUATIONS: -Asterisk as UAS
	  1. Incoming INVITE: NO "Session-Expires" 2. Incoming INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires" -Asterisk as UAC 3. Outgoing INVITE: NO
	  "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response HAS "Session-Expires" header
	  4. Outgoing INVITE: NO "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response NO
	  "Session-Expires" header 5. Outgoing INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires". Active - Asterisk will have an active refresh
	  timer regardless if the other endpoint does. Inactive - Asterisk
	  does not have an active refresh timer regardless if the other
	  endpoint does. XXXXXXX - Not possible for mode.

	  does not need to be returned for any reason.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample, CHANGES, channels/sip/include/sip.h,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: authenticate OPTIONS requests just like we
	  would an INVITE OPTIONS requests should be treated the same as an
	  INVITE This includes authentication. This patch adds the ability
	  for incoming out of dialog OPTION requests to be authenticated
	  before providing a response indicating whether an extension is
	  available or not. The authentication routine works the exact same
	  way as it does for incoming INVITEs. This means that if a peer
	  has 'insecure=invite' in their peer definition, the same will be
	  true for the processing of the OPTIONS request. Review:

	  | 19 lines Fixed how Asterisk destroys a dialog on channel hangup
	  before invite receives a response. If an ast_channel with a SIP
	  tech pvt hangs up before the sip dialog gets a response to its
	  outgoing INVITE, Asterisk used to pretend_ack the INVITE. This is
	  not rfc compliant and results in confusion at the other endpoint.
	  sip_pretend_ack will ack and remove all the packets in the
	  retransmit queue. This means that the INVITE will stop
	  retransmitting, and that any response to that INVITE that comes
	  after the pretend_ack occurs will be ignored. Instead of faking
	  any sort of acknowledgement for an outgoing INVITE during an
	  internal hangup, we should let the protocol stack process the
	  INVITE transaction and terminate the dialog properly. This is
	  achieved by setting the PENDING_BYE flag. When this flag is used,
	  once the dialog proceeds to an escapable state the transaction
	  will either be canceled with a SIP_CANCEL or completed followed
	  immediately by a BYE. Attempting to do this any other way is
	  incorrect. If the endpoint is not responding to the INVITE
	  request, the INVITE must continue to be retransmitted until it
	  times out which will result in the dialog being destroyed.

	  | 11 lines This fix makes sure the ast_channel hangs up correctly
	  when the dialog's PENDING_BYE flag is set. When the pending bye
	  flag is used, it is possible that the dialog will terminate and
	  leave the sip_pvt->owner channel up. This is because we never
	  hangup the ast_channel after sending the SIP_BYE request. When we
	  receive the response for the SIP_BYE we set need_destroy which we
	  would expect to destroy the dialog on the next do_monitor loop,
	  but this is not the case. The dialog will only be destroyed once
	  the owner is hungup even with the need_destroy flag set. This
	  patch sets the softhangup flag on the ast_channel when a SIP_BYE
	  request is sent as a result of the pending bye flag. ........

	* CHANGES, include/asterisk/translate.h, main/cli.c,
	  main/translate.c: improved translation paths for wideband codecs
	  The problem I'm addressing is that Asterisk's current method of
	  building the least cost translation paths between codecs does not
	  take into account sample rate. For instance, it was possible for
	  siren14 (a 32khz codec), to contain the a translation path to
	  siren7 (a 16khz audio codec) that goes through slin at 8khz. In
	  this case Asterisk takes a 32khz codec, down samples it to 8khz
	  and then up samples it to 16khz which is terrible regardless if
	  it is computationally less expensive. This patch now builds
	  translation paths that give priority to maintaining the best
	  possible sample rate before taking into consideration
	  computational cost. This patch also adds cli commands to expose
	  what translation paths are actually being used. Changes: 1.
	  Translation paths will never contain a step that changes the
	  sample rate unless absolutely necessary. 2. When choosing the
	  best codec to make two channels compatible. Shared codecs with
	  the highest sample rate are given priority. 3. A new cli command
	  to show all translation paths available for a specific codec
	  'core show translation paths [codec name]' has been added. 4.
	  'core show translation' which displays the translation matrix now
	  includes the new higher bit audio codecs in the table. 5. 'core
	  show channel [channel name]' now displays the translation paths
	  if translation is used. (closes issue #16841) Reported by:

	* channels/sig_pri.c, channels/chan_dahdi.c: Fix inband DTMF
	  detection on outgoing ISDN calls. This is a regression from the
	  sig_pri split from chan_dahdi. When a call is first initiated,
	  the inband DTMF detector is not enabled if it's an outgoing ISDN
	  call. However, it needs to be turned on once the media path
	  starts up. This handling was put back in the open_media()
	  callback of chan_dahdi. In sig_pri, open_media() calls were added
	  to a few places where it was needed, including handling of
	  PRI_EVENT_RINGING, PRI_EVENT_PROGRESS, and PRI_EVENT_PROCEEDING.

	* channels/sip/include/sip.h,
	  channels/sip/include/reqresp_parser.h, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c: transaction matching using top
	  most Via header This patch modifies the way chan_sip.c does
	  transaction to dialog matching. Asterisk now stores information
	  in the top most Via header of the initial incoming request and
	  compares that against other Requests that have the same call-id.
	  This results in Asterisk being able to detect a forked call in
	  which it has received multiple legs of the fork. I completely
	  stripped out the previous matching code and made the comparisons
	  a little more explicit and easier to understand. My comments in
	  the code should offer all the details involving this patch. This
	  patch also fixes a bug with the usage of the OBJ-MULTIPLE flag to
	  find multiple dialogs with the same call-id. Since the callback
	  function was returning (CMP_MATCH | CMP_STOP) only the first item
	  found was being returned. I fixed this by making a new callback
	  function for finding multiple dialogs that only returns
	  (CMP_MATCH) on a match allowing for multiple items to be
	  returned. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/776/

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c, channels/sig_analog.c: Fix invalid test
	  for rxisoffhook in FXO channels This fixes some cases of no
	  outgoing calls on FXO before an incoming call. Remove an
	  unnecessary testing of an "off-hook" bit from DAHDI for FXO
	  (KS/GS) channels.In some cases the bit would not be initialized
	  properly before the first inbound call and thus prevent an
	  outgoing call. If those tests are actually required by anybody,
	  they should define DAHDI_CHECK_HOOKSTATE in channels/sig_analog.c

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Fix port setting of external address
	  in SIP. There are two changes here: 1. Since the externip setting
	  can now have a port attached to it, calling it "externip" is
	  misleading. The option is now documented and parsed as
	  "externaddr." This also extends to the "matchexterniplocally"
	  setting. It is now documented and parsed as
	  "matchexternaddrlocally." The old names for the options may still
	  be used, but they are no longer used in the sip.conf.sample file.
	  2. If no port is set for the externaddr, and UDP is the transport
	  to be used, then we will set the port of the externaddr to that
	  of the udpbindaddr. This was how things worked prior to the IPv6
	  merge, so this is a regression fix. (closes issue #17665)

	  decrement this counter and detects when it reaches zero, at which

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix MWI notification transmission problems
	  over SIP. MWI updates were not being sent if no messages were
	  found in the event cache. This was corrected since a phone may
	  need to clear its MWI status configured previously from another
	  mailbox. Upon module or sip reload, MWI updates could not be sent
	  due to the sipsock socket not being set early enough in
	  reload_config. The code handling the descriptor assignment and
	  such has simply been moved before the call to build_peer. Issuing
	  a sip reload cleared the IP address of the peer, but skipped
	  checking the database for registration information. The database
	  is now checked both for sip reload and actually reloading the
	  module. If a transmission occurs before the do_monitor thread has
	  started, do not attempt to send a signal to it. (closes issue

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, main/dnsmgr.c, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  main/acl.c: Fix errors where incorrect address information was
	  printed. ast_sockaddr_stringiy_fmt (which is call by all
	  ast_sockaddr_stringify* functions) uses thread-local storage for
	  storing the string that it creates. In cases where
	  ast_sockaddr_stringify_fmt was being called twice within the same
	  statement, the result of one call would be overwritten by the
	  result of the other call. This usually was happening in
	  printf-like statements and was resulting in the same stringified
	  addressed being printed twice instead of two separate addresses.
	  I have fixed this by using ast_strdupa on the result of stringify
	  functions if they are used twice within the same statement. As
	  far as I could tell, there were no instances where a pointer to
	  the result of such a call were saved anywhere, so this is the
	  only situation I could see where this error could occur.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: handle special case were "200 Ok" to pending
	  INVITE never receives ACK Unlike most responses, the 200 Ok to a
	  pending INVITE Request is acknowledged by an ACK Request. If the
	  ACK Request for this Response is not received the previous
	  behavior was to immediately destroy the dialog and hangup the
	  channel. Now in an effort to be more RFC compliant, instead of
	  immediately destroying the dialog during this special case,
	  termination is done with a BYE Request as the dialog is
	  technically confirmed when the 200 Ok is sent even if the ACK is
	  never received. The behavior of immediately hanging up the
	  channel remains. This only affects how dialog termination
	  proceeds for this one special case. RFC 3261 section 13.3.1.4 "If
	  the server retransmits the 2xx response for 64*T1 seconds without
	  receiving an ACK, the dialog is confirmed, but the session SHOULD
	  be terminated. This is accomplished with a BYE, as described in
	  Section 15."

	  restructuring The purpose of this patch is to eliminate struct
	  ast_callerid since it has turned into a miscellaneous collection
	  of various party information. Eliminate struct ast_callerid and
	  replace it with the following struct organization: struct
	  ast_party_name { char *str; int char_set; int presentation;
	  unsigned char valid; }; struct ast_party_number { char *str; int
	  plan; int presentation; unsigned char valid; }; struct
	  ast_party_subaddress { char *str; int type; unsigned char
	  odd_even_indicator; unsigned char valid; }; struct ast_party_id {
	  struct ast_party_name name; struct ast_party_number number;
	  struct ast_party_subaddress subaddress; char *tag; }; struct
	  ast_party_dialed { struct { char *str; int plan; } number; struct
	  ast_party_subaddress subaddress; int transit_network_select; };
	  struct ast_party_caller { struct ast_party_id id; char *ani; int
	  ani2; }; The new organization adds some new information as well.
	  * The party name and number now have their own presentation value
	  that can be manipulated independently. ISDN supplies the
	  presentation value for the name and number at different times
	  with the possibility that they could be different. * The party
	  name and number now have a valid flag. Before this change the
	  name or number string could be empty if the presentation were
	  restricted. Most channel drivers assume that the name or number
	  is then simply not available instead of indicating that the name
	  or number was restricted. * The party name now has a character
	  set value. SIP and Q.SIG have the ability to indicate what
	  character set a name string is using so it could be presented
	  properly. * The dialed party now has a numbering plan value that
	  could be useful to have available. The various channel drivers
	  will need to be updated to support the new core features as
	  needed. They have simply been converted to supply current
	  functionality at this time. The following items of note were
	  either corrected or enhanced: * The CONNECTEDLINE() and
	  REDIRECTING() dialplan functions were consolidated into
	  func_callerid.c to share party id handling code. * CALLERPRES()
	  is now deprecated because the name and number have their own
	  presentation values. * Fixed app_alarmreceiver.c
	  write_metadata(). The workstring[] could contain garbage. It also
	  can only contain the caller id number so using
	  ast_callerid_parse() on it is silly. There was also a typo in the
	  CALLERNAME if test. * Fixed app_rpt.c using ast_callerid_parse()
	  on the channel's caller id number string. ast_callerid_parse()
	  alters the given buffer which in this case is the channel's
	  caller id number string. Then using ast_shrink_phone_number()
	  could alter it even more. * Fixed caller ID name and number
	  memory leak in chan_usbradio.c. * Fixed uninitialized char arrays
	  cid_num[] and cid_name[] in sig_analog.c. * Protected access to a
	  caller channel with lock in chan_sip.c. * Clarified intent of
	  code in app_meetme.c sla_ring_station() and dial_trunk(). Also
	  made save all caller ID data instead of just the name and number
	  strings. * Simplified cdr.c set_one_cid(). It hand coded the
	  ast_callerid_merge() function. * Corrected some weirdness with
	  app_privacy.c's use of caller presentation. Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h: chan_sip: RFC
	  compliant retransmission timeout Retransmission of packets should
	  not be based on how many packets were sent, but instead on a
	  timeout period. Depending on whether or not the packet is for a
	  INVITE or NON-INVITE transaction, the number of packets sent
	  during the retransmission timeout period will be different, so
	  timing out based on the number of packets sent is not accurate.
	  This patch fixes this by removing the retransmit limit and only
	  stopping retransmission after a timeout period is reached. By
	  default this timeout period is 64*(Timer T1) for both INVITE and
	  non-INVITE transactions. For more information on sip timer values

	  feature group, a native bridge would occur that may prevent

	  show the key mapping as empty if it was using the default mapping
	  and not a custom mapping in the feature group. Add feature groups
	  to the output of "features show". Adjust the feature execution
	  logic to match that of the logic when executing a feature that
	  was not configured through a feature group. Update
	  features.conf.sample to show that an '=' is still required if
	  using the default key mapping from [applicationmap]. Finally,
	  clean up a little bit of formatting to better coform to coding
	  guidelines while in the area. (closes issue #17589) Reported by:

	  accepted. A recent check was added to ensure that we did not
	  erroneously detect duplicate DTMF when we received packets out of
	  order. The problem was that the check did not account for the
	  fact that the seqno of an RTP stream will roll over back to 0
	  after hitting 65535. Now, we have a secondary check that will
	  ensure that the seqno rolling over will not cause us to stop

	  that we now send a "416 Unsupported URI scheme" response instead
	  of a "404" when the scheme is not recognized. This indicates to
	  the initiator of the INVITE to retry the request with a correct
	  URI.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: more accurate retransmissions
	  RFC3261 states that Timer A should start at 500ms (T1) by
	  default. In chan_sip this value initially started at 1000ms and I
	  changed it to 500ms recently. After doing that I noticed in my
	  packet captures that it still occasionally retransmitted starting
	  at 1000ms instead of 500ms like I told it to. This occurs because
	  the scheduler runs in the do_monitor thread. If a new
	  retransmission is added while the do_monitor thread is sleeping
	  then it may not detect that retransmission for nearly 1000ms. To
	  fix this I just poke the do_monitor thread to wake up when a new
	  packet is sent reliably requiring retransmits. The thread then
	  detects the new scheduler entry and adjusts its sleep time to
	  account for it. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/747

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Resolve some errors produced during module
	  unload of chan_iax2. The external test suite stops Asterisk using
	  the "core stop gracefully" command. The logs from the tests show
	  that there are a number of problems with Asterisk trying to
	  cleanly shut down. This patch addresses the following type of
	  error that comes from chan_iax2: [Jun 22 16:58:11] ERROR[29884]:
	  lock.c:129 __ast_pthread_mutex_destroy: chan_iax2.c line 11371

	  purpose of this patch is to change the thread pool shutdown
	  procedure to be more explicit to ensure that the thread exits
	  from a point where it is not holding a lock. While testing that,
	  I encountered various crashes due to the order of operations in

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add extra protection for reinvite glare
	  scenario. Testing proved that if Asterisk sent a connected line
	  reinvite, and the endpoint to which the reinvite were being sent
	  sent a reinvite, Asterisk would not properly respond with a 491
	  response. The reason is that on connected line reinvites, we set
	  the dialog's invitestate to INV_CALLING to prevent Asterisk from
	  sending a rapid flurry of connected line reinvites. For other
	  reinvites we do not do this. Because of the current invitestate,
	  when Asterisk received the reinvite, we interpreted this as a
	  spiraled INVITE, and thus did not behave properly. The fix for
	  this is to not enter the loop detection or spiral logic in
	  handle_request_invite if the channel state is currently up. This
	  way, no mid-call reinvites will be misinterpreted, no matter what
	  the nature of the reinvite may have been.

	* channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c: fixes some coding guideline issue

	* channels/sip/include/dialog.h, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: retransmit response to BYE requests
	  until timer J expires According to RFC 3261 section 17.2.2, which
	  describes non-INVITE server transaction, when a dialog enters the
	  Completed state it must destroy the dialog after Timer J (T1*64)
	  fires. For a BYE transaction Asterisk terminates the dialog
	  immediately during sip_hangup() when it should be waiting T1*64
	  ms. This results in some odd behavior. For instance if Asterisk
	  receives a BYE and transmits a 200ok in response, if the endpoint
	  never receives the 200ok it will retransmit the BYE to which
	  Asterisk responds with a "481 Call leg/transaction does not
	  exist" because the dialog is already gone. To resolve this I made
	  a function called sip_scheddestroy_final(). This differs slightly
	  from sip_schedestroy() in that it enables a flag that will
	  prevent the destruction from ever being rescheduled or canceled
	  afterwards. It also prevents the pvt's needdestroy flag from
	  being set which triggers the destruction of the dialog within the
	  do_monitor thread(). By using this function we are guaranteed
	  destruction will not occur until the scheduled time. This allows
	  Asterisk to respond to any possible retransmits for a dialog
	  after we process the initial BYE request for T1*64 ms. Other
	  changes: I removed two instances where sip_cancel_destroy is used
	  right before calling sip_scheddestroy. sip_scheddestroy always
	  calls sip_cancel_destroy before scheduling the new destruction so
	  it is completely unnecessary. Review:

	  Jun 2010) | 22 lines fixes chan_iax2 race condition There is code
	  in chan_iax2.c that attempts to guarantee that only a single
	  active thread will handle a call number at a time. This code
	  works once the thread is added to an active_list of threads, but
	  we are not currently guaranteed that a newly activated thread
	  will enter the active_list immediately because it is left up to
	  the thread to add itself after frames have been queued to it.
	  This means that if two frames come in for the same call number at
	  the same time, it is possible for them to grab two separate
	  threads because the first thread did not add itself to the
	  active_list fast enough. This causes some pretty complex
	  problems. This patch resolves this race condition by immediately
	  adding an activated thread to the active_list within the network
	  thread and only depending on the thread to remove itself once it
	  is done processing the frames queued to it. By doing this we are
	  guaranteed that if another frame for the same call number comes
	  in at the same time, that this thread will immediately be found
	  in the active_list of threads. Review:

	  2010) | 19 lines Fix potential crash when writing raw SLIN audio
	  on a PLC-enabled channel. The issue here was that the frame
	  created when adjusting for PLC had no offset to its audio data.
	  If this frame were translated to another format prior to being
	  sent out an RTP socket, all went well because the translation
	  code would put an appropriate offset into the frame. However, if
	  the SLIN audio were not translated before being sent out the RTP
	  socket, bad things would happen. Specifically, the
	  ast_rtp_raw_write makes the assumption that the frame has at
	  least enough of an offset that it can accommodate an RTP header.
	  This was not the case. As such, data was being written prior to
	  the allocation, likely corrupting the data the memory allocator
	  had written. Thus when the time came to free the data, all hell
	  broke loose. ....Well, Asterisk crashed at least. The fix was
	  just what one would expect. Offset the data in the frame by a
	  reasonable amount. The method I used is a bit odd since the data
	  in the frame is 16 bit integers and not bytes. I left a big ol'
	  comment about it. This can be improved on if someone is
	  interested. I was more interested in getting the crash resolved.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: fixes compile error from uninitialized
	  variable

	* channels/chan_sip.c: RFC3261 compliant sip unreliable retransmit
	  timing + 'registerattempts' option tweak Changes. 1. RFC 3261
	  states in section 17.1.2.2 and 17.1.1.2 that retransmission
	  timers should initially be set to timer T1. T1 by default is
	  500ms. Asterisk was starting the retransmission timers at T1*2
	  which shouldn't cause any problems, but is not RFC compliant. 2.
	  RFC 3261 states in section 17.1.2.2 that for a non-INVITE client
	  transaction, if the retransmit timer fires while in the
	  proceeding state that the request must be retransmitted. Asterisk
	  currently ack's requests for both INVITE and non-INVITE
	  transactions when a 1XX response is received, this patch changes
	  this for non-INVITE requests. 3. The 'registerattempts' option in
	  sip.conf is supposed to set how many registry attempts will be
	  made before giving up. When this option is set to 1, I would
	  expect only one registry attempt to be made before stopping
	  because of a failure, but instead two are made. In my opinion
	  this is not expected behavior. This option does not indicate that
	  these are re-attempts. The logic behind this option has been
	  changed to only attempt registers the exact number of times this
	  option is set to. If this option is 0, it still continues to
	  re-attempt the registration forever. Review:

	* main/channel.c: Channel initialization failure causes crashes.
	  __ast_channel_alloc_ap() has several points in the initialization
	  of a new channel structure where it could fail. Since the channel
	  structure is now an ao2 object, the destructor callback needs to
	  be able to handle clean up when the structure setup is
	  incomplete. Problems corrected: 1) Failing to setup the alertpipe
	  would not unreference the structure but free it directly. Doing
	  this to an ao2_object is very bad. 2) File descriptors need to be
	  initialized to -1 before a construction failure could occur so
	  the destructor will not close unopened descriptors. 3) The
	  destructor needs to check that the string field has been
	  initialized before using any string field values. Crashes
	  expected. 4) The destructor should not notify devstate if the
	  device name is empty. It is a waste of cycles and a couple ERROR
	  log messages are generated. Review:

	  frames until after the sleep has concluded. From reviewboard
	  Background: A Digium customer discovered a somewhat odd bug. The
	  setup is that parties A and B are bridged, and party A places
	  party B on hold. While party B is listening to hold music, he
	  mashes a bunch of DTMF. Party A takes party B off hold while this
	  is happening, but party B continues to hear hold music. I could
	  reproduce this about 1 in 5 times. The issue: When DTMF features
	  are enabled and a user presses keys, the channel that the DTMF is
	  streamed to is placed in an ast_safe_sleep for 100 ms, the
	  duration of the emulated tone. If an AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD frame is
	  read from the channel during the sleep, the frame is dropped.
	  Thus the unhold indication is never made to the channel that was
	  originally placed on hold. The fix: Originally, I discussed with
	  Kevin possible ways of fixing the specific problem reported.
	  However, we determined that the same type of problem could happen
	  in other situations where ast_safe_sleep() is used. Using
	  autoservice as a model, I modified ast_safe_sleep_conditional()
	  to defer specific frame types so they can be re-queued once the
	  sleep has finished. I made a common function for determining if a
	  frame should be deferred so that there are not two identical
	  switch blocks to maintain. Review:

	  include/asterisk/options.h, main/asterisk.c, main/loader.c: Fix
	  transcode_via_sln option with SIP calls and improve PLC usage.
	  From reviewboard: The problem here is a bit complex, so try to
	  bear with me... It was noticed by a Digium customer that generic
	  PLC (as configured in codecs.conf) did not appear to actually be
	  having any sort of benefit when packet loss was introduced on an
	  RTP stream. I reproduced this issue myself by streaming a file
	  across an RTP stream and dropping approx. 5% of the RTP packets.
	  I saw no real difference between when PLC was enabled or disabled
	  when using wireshark to analyze the RTP streams. After analyzing
	  what was going on, it became clear that one of the problems faced
	  was that when running my tests, the translation paths were being
	  set up in such a way that PLC could not possibly work as
	  expected. To illustrate, if packets are lost on channel A's read
	  stream, then we expect that PLC will be applied to channel B's
	  write stream. The problem is that generic PLC can only be done
	  when there is a translation path that moves from some codec to
	  SLINEAR. When I would run my tests, I found that every single
	  time, read and write translation paths would be set up on channel
	  A instead of channel B. There appeared to be no real way to
	  predict which channel the translation paths would be set up on.
	  This is where Kevin swooped in to let me know about the
	  transcode_via_sln option in asterisk.conf. It is supposed to work
	  by placing a read translation path on both channels from the
	  channel's rawreadformat to SLINEAR. It also will place a write
	  translation path on both channels from SLINEAR to the channel's
	  rawwriteformat. Using this option allows one to predictably set
	  up translation paths on all channels. There are two problems with
	  this, though. First and foremost, the transcode_via_sln option
	  did not appear to be working properly when I was placing a SIP
	  call between two endpoints which did not share any common
	  formats. Second, even if this option were to work, for PLC to be
	  applied, there had to be a write translation path that would go
	  from some format to SLINEAR. It would not work properly if the
	  starting format of translation was SLINEAR. The one-line change
	  presented in this review request in chan_sip.c fixed the first
	  issue for me. The problem was that in sip_request_call, the
	  jointcapability of the outbound channel was being set to the
	  format passed to sip_request_call. This is nativeformats of the
	  inbound channel. Because of this, when
	  ast_channel_make_compatible was called by app_dial, both channels
	  already had compatibly read and write formats. Thus, no
	  translation path was set up at the time. My change is to set the
	  jointcapability of the sip_pvt created during sip_request_call to
	  the intersection of the inbound channel's nativeformats and the
	  configured peer capability that we determined during the earlier
	  call to create_addr. Doing this got the translation paths set up
	  as expected when using transcode_via_sln. The changes presented
	  in channel.c fixed the second issue for me. First and foremost,
	  when Asterisk is started, we'll read codecs.conf to see the value
	  of the genericplc option. If this option is set, and ast_write is
	  called for a frame with no data, then we will attempt to fill in
	  the missing samples for the frame. The implementation uses a
	  channel datastore for maintaining the PLC state and for creating
	  a buffer to store PLC samples in. Even when we receive a frame
	  with data, we'll call plc_rx so that the PLC state will have
	  knowledge of the previous voice frame, which it can use as a
	  basis for when it comes time to actually do a PLC fill-in. So,
	  reviewers, now I ask for your help. First off, there's the one
	  line change in chan_sip that I have put in. Is it right? By my
	  logic it seems correct, but I'm sure someone can tell me why it
	  is not going to work. This is probably the change I'm least
	  concerned about, though. What concerns me much more is the set of
	  changes in channel.c. First off, am I even doing it right? When I
	  run tests, I can clearly see that when PLC is activated, I see a
	  significant increase in RTP traffic where I would expect it to
	  be. However, in my humble opinion, the audio sounds kind of
	  crappy whenever the PLC fill-in is done. It sounds worse to me
	  than when no PLC is used at all. I need someone to review the
	  logic I have used to be sure that I'm not misusing anything. As
	  far as I can see my pointer arithmetic is correct, and my use of
	  AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET should be correct as well, but I'm sure
	  someone can point out somewhere where I've done something
	  incorrectly. As I was writing this review request up, I decided
	  to give the code a test run under valgrind, and I find that for
	  some reason, calls to plc_rx are causing some invalid reads.
	  Apparently I'm reading past the end of a buffer somehow. I'll
	  have to dig around a bit to see why that is the case. If it's
	  obvious to someone reviewing, speak up! Finally, I have one other
	  proposal that is not reflected in my code review. Since without
	  transcode_via_sln set, one cannot predict or control where a
	  translation path will be up, it seems to me that the current
	  practice of using PLC only when transcoding to SLINEAR is not
	  useful. I recommend that once it has been determined that the
	  method used in this code review is correct and works as expected,
	  then the code in translate.c that invokes PLC should be removed.

	  to connected line and redirecting work. From reviewboard: Digium
	  has a commercial customer who has made extensive use of the
	  connected party and redirecting information present in later
	  versions of Asterisk Business Edition and which is to be in the
	  upcoming 1.8 release. Through their use of the feature, new
	  problems and solutions have come about. This patch adds several
	  enhancements to maximize usage of the connected party and
	  redirecting information functionality. First, Asterisk trunk
	  already had connected line interception macros. These macros
	  allow you to manipulate connected line information before it was
	  sent out to its target. This patch adds the same feature except
	  for redirecting information instead. Second, the ast_callerid and
	  ast_party_id structures have been enhanced to provide a "tag."
	  This tag can be set with func_callerid, func_connectedline,
	  func_redirecting, and in the case of DAHDI, mISDN, and SIP
	  channels, can be set in a configuration file. The idea behind the
	  callerid tag is that it can be set to whatever value the
	  administrator likes. Later, when running connected line and
	  redirecting macros, the admin can read the tag off the
	  appropriate structure to determine what action to take. You can
	  think of this sort of like a channel variable, except that
	  instead of having the variable associated with a channel, the
	  variable is associated with a specific identity within Asterisk.
	  Third, app_dial has two new options, s and u. The s option lets a
	  dialplan writer force a specific caller ID tag to be placed on
	  the outgoing channel. The u option allows the dialplan writer to
	  force a specific calling presentation value on the outgoing
	  channel. Fourth, there is a new control frame subclass called
	  AST_CONTROL_READ_ACTION added. This was added to correct a very
	  specific situation. In the case of SIP semi-attended (blond)
	  transfers, the party being transferred would not have the
	  opportunity to run a connected line interception macro to
	  possibly alter the transfer target's connected line information.
	  The issue here was that during a blond transfer, the SIP transfer
	  code has no bridged channel on which to queue the connected line
	  update. The way this was corrected was to add this new control
	  frame subclass. Now, we queue an AST_CONTROL_READ_ACTION frame on
	  the channel on which the connected line interception macro should
	  be run. When ast_read is called to read the frame, ast_read
	  responds by calling a callback function associated with the
	  specific read action the control frame describes. In this case,
	  the action taken is to run the connected line interception macro
	  on the transferee's channel. Review:

	  test_heap.diff uploaded by cappucinoking (license 1036) Tested
	  by: cappucinoking, russell

	* main/heap.c: Fix handling of removing nodes from the middle of a
	  heap. This bug surfaced in 1.6.2 and does not affect code in any
	  other released version of Asterisk. It manifested itself as SIP
	  qualify not happening when it should, causing peers to go
	  unreachable. This was debugged down to scheduler entries
	  sometimes not getting executed when they were supposed to, which
	  was in turn caused by an error in the heap code. The problem only
	  sometimes occurs, and it is due to the logic for removing an
	  entry in the heap from an arbitrary location (not just popping
	  off the top). The scheduler performs this operation frequently
	  when entries are removed before they run (when ast_sched_del() is
	  used). In a normal pop off of the top of the heap, a node is
	  taken off the bottom, placed at the top, and then bubbled down
	  until the max heap property is restored (see max_heapify()). This
	  same logic was used for removing an arbitrary node from the
	  middle of the heap. Unfortunately, that logic is full of fail.
	  This patch fixes that by fully restoring the max heap property
	  when a node is thrown into the middle of the heap. Instead of
	  just pushing it down as appropriate, it first pushes it up as
	  high as it will go, and _then_ pushes it down. Lastly, fix a
	  minor problem in ast_heap_verify(), which is only used for
	  debugging. If a parent and child node have the same value, that
	  is not an error. The only error is if a parent's value is less
	  than its children. A huge thanks goes out to cappucinoking for
	  debugging this down to the scheduler, and then producing an
	  ast_heap test case that demonstrated the breakage. That made it
	  very easy for me to focus on the heap logic and produce a fix.
	  Open source projects are awesome. (closes issue #16936) Reported

	  due to accessing channel data without the channel locked. In
	  res_musiconhold.c, there are several places where a channel's
	  stream's existence is checked prior to calling ast_closestream on
	  it. The issue here is that in several cases, the channel was not
	  locked while checking the stream. The result was that if two
	  threads checked the state of the channel's stream at
	  approximately the same time, then there could be a situation
	  where both threads attempt to call ast_closestream on the
	  channel's stream. The result here is that the refcount for the
	  stream would go below 0, resulting in a crash. I have added
	  proper channel locking to res_musiconhold.c to ensure that we do
	  not try to check chan->stream without the channel locked. A
	  Digium customer has been using this patch for several weeks and
	  has not had any crashes since applying the patch. ABE-2147

	  | 33 lines resolves deadlocks in chan_local Issue_1. In the
	  local_hangup() 3 locks must be held at the same time... pvt,
	  pvt->chan, and pvt->owner. Proper deadlock avoidance is done when
	  the channel to hangup is the outbound chan_local channel, but
	  when it is not the outbound channel we have an issue... We
	  attempt to do deadlock avoidance only on the tech pvt, when both
	  the tech pvt and the pvt->owner are locked coming into that loop.
	  By never giving up the pvt->owner channel deadlock avoidance is
	  not entirely possible. This patch resolves that by doing deadlock
	  avoidance on both the pvt->owner and the pvt when trying to get
	  the pvt->chan lock. Issue_2. ast_prod() is used in
	  ast_activate_generator() to queue a frame on the channel and make
	  the channel's read function get called. This function is used in
	  ast_activate_generator() while the channel is locked, which
	  mean's the channel will have a lock both from the generator code
	  and the frame_queue code by the time it gets to chan_local.c's
	  local_queue_frame code... local_queue_frame contains some of the
	  same crazy deadlock avoidance that local_hangup requires, and
	  this recursive lock prevents that deadlock avoidance from
	  happening correctly. This patch removes ast_prod() from the
	  channel lock so only one lock is held during the
	  local_queue_frame function. (closes issue #17185) Reported by:

	* res/res_fax.c, include/asterisk/res_fax.h, res/res_fax_spandsp.c:
	  Update res_fax and res_fax_spandsp to be compatible with Fax For
	  Asterisk 1.2. The fax session initilization code for T.38 faxes
	  has been rewritten. T.38 session initialization was removed from
	  generic_fax_exec, and split into two different code paths for
	  receive and send. Also the 'z' option (to send a T.38 reinvite if
	  we do not receive one) was added to sendfax. In the output of
	  'fax show sessions', the 'Type' column has been renamed to 'Tech'
	  and replaced with a new 'Tech' column that will report 'G.711' or
	  'T.38'. Control of ECM defaults has been added to res_fax A 'fax
	  show settings' CLI command has been added. Support of the new
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS control method request to handle channels
	  that have already received a T.38 reinvite before the FAX
	  application is start has been added. Support for the 'fax show
	  settings' command has been added to res_fax_spandsp and handling
	  of the ECM flag has been slightly altered.

	* tests/test_event.c, main/event.c: Add ast_event subscription unit
	  test and fix some ast_event API bugs. This patch introduces
	  another test in test_event.c that exercises most of the
	  subscription related ast_event API calls. I made some minor
	  additions to the existing event allocation test to increase API
	  coverage by the test code. Finally, I made a list in a comment of
	  API calls not yet touched by the test module as a to-do list for
	  future test development. During the development of this test
	  code, I discovered a number of bugs in the event API. 1)
	  subscriptions to AST_EVENT_ALL were not handled appropriately in
	  a couple of different places. The API allows a subscription to
	  all event types, but with IE parameters, just as if it was a
	  subscription to a specific event type. However, the parameters
	  were being ignored. This affected ast_event_check_subscriber()
	  and event distribution to subscribers. 2) Some of the logic in
	  ast_event_check_subscriber() for checking subscriptions against
	  query parameters was wrong. Review:

	  frames faster Mantis issue 17078 reports MixMonitor recordings
	  have shorter durations than the call duration. This was because
	  the mixmonitor thread was not processing frames from the
	  audiohook fast enough. The mixmonitor thread would slowly fall
	  behind the most recent audio frame and when the channel hangs up,
	  the mixmonitor thread would exit without processing the same
	  number of frames as the channel; leaving the mixmonitor recording
	  shorter than actual call duration. This revision fixes this issue
	  by moving the ast_audiohook_trigger_wait() and the subsequent
	  audiohook.status check into the block where the
	  ast_audiohook_read_frame() function returns NULL. (closes issue

	  that passing an empty EventMasks parameter would also result in
	  no response being returned, this has been fixed as well while
	  being preserved when the broken behavior is requested. (closes

	* main/ccss.c: Fix issue where recall would not happen when it
	  should. Specifically, the situation would happen when multiple
	  callers would request CC for a single generically-monitored
	  device. If the monitored device became available but the caller
	  did not answer the recall, then there was nothing that would poke
	  the CC core to let it know that it should attempt to recall
	  someone else instead. After careful consideration, I came to the
	  conclusion that the only area of Asterisk that needed to be
	  touched was the generic CC monitor. All other types of CC would
	  require something outside of Asterisk to invoke a recall for a
	  separate device. This was accomplished by changing the generic
	  monitor destructor to poke other generic monitor instances if the
	  device is currently available and the specific instance was
	  currently not suspended. In order to not accidentally trigger
	  recalls at bad times, the fit_for_recall flag was also added to
	  the generic_monitor_instance_list struct. This gets set as soon
	  as a monitored device becomes available. It gets cleared if a
	  CCNR request triggers the creation of a new generic monitor
	  instance. By doing this, we don't accidentally try to recall a
	  device when the monitored device was being monitored for CCNR and
	  never actually became available for recall in the first place.
	  This error was discovered by Steve Pitts during in-house testing
	  at Digium.

	  trunk. From Reviewboard: CCSS stands for Call Completion
	  Supplementary Services. An admittedly out-of-date overview of the
	  architecture can be found in the file doc/CCSS_architecture.pdf
	  in the CCSS branch. Off the top of my head, the big differences
	  between what is implemented and what is in the document are as
	  follows: 1. We did not end up modifying the Hangup application at
	  all. 2. The document states that a single call completion monitor
	  may be used across multiple calls to the same device. This proved
	  to not be such a good idea when implementing protocol-specific
	  monitors, and so we ended up using one monitor per-device
	  per-call. 3. There are some configuration options which were
	  conceived after the document was written. These are documented in
	  the ccss.conf.sample that is on this review request. For some
	  basic understanding of terminology used throughout this code, see
	  the ccss.tex document that is on this review. This implements
	  CCBS and CCNR in several flavors. First up is a "generic"
	  implementation, which can work over any channel technology
	  provided that the channel technology can accurately report device
	  state. Call completion is requested using the dialplan
	  application CallCompletionRequest and can be canceled using
	  CallCompletionCancel. Device state subscriptions are used in
	  order to monitor the state of called parties. Next, there is a
	  SIP-specific implementation of call completion. This method uses
	  the methods outlined in draft-ietf-bliss-call-completion-06 to
	  implement call completion using SIP signaling. There are a few
	  things to note here: * The agent/monitor terminology used
	  throughout Asterisk sometimes is the reverse of what is defined
	  in the referenced draft. * Implementation of the draft required
	  support for SIP PUBLISH. I attempted to write this in a
	  generic-enough fashion such that if someone were to want to write
	  PUBLISH support for other event packages, such as dialog-state or
	  presence, most of the effort would be in writing callbacks
	  specific to the event package. * A subportion of supporting
	  PUBLISH reception was that we had to implement a PIDF parser. The
	  PIDF support added is a bit minimal. I first wrote a validation
	  routine to ensure that the PIDF document is formatted properly.
	  The rest of the PIDF reading is done in-line in the
	  call-completion-specific PUBLISH-handling code. In other words,
	  while there is PIDF support here, it is not in any state where it
	  could easily be applied to other event packages as is. Finally,
	  there are a variety of ISDN-related call completion protocols
	  supported. These were written by Richard Mudgett, and as such I
	  can't really say much about their implementation. There are notes
	  in the CHANGES file that indicate the ISDN protocols over which
	  call completion is supported. Review:
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/523

	* main/srv.c, channels/chan_sip.c, funcs/func_srv.c (added),
	  CHANGES, include/asterisk/srv.h: func_srv and explicit
	  specification of a remote IP for SIP. From Review Board: There
	  are two interrelated changes here. First, there is the
	  introduction of func_srv. This adds two new read-only dialplan
	  functions, SRVQUERY and SRVRESULT. They work very similarly to
	  the ENUMQUERY and ENUMRESULT functions, except that this allows
	  one to query SRV records instead. In order to facilitate this
	  work, I added a couple of new API calls to srv.h.
	  ast_srv_get_record_count tells the number of records returned by
	  an SRV lookup. This number is calculated at the time of the SRV
	  lookup. ast_srv_get_nth_record allows one to get a numbered SRV
	  record. Second, there is the modification to chan_sip that allows
	  one to specify a hostname or IP address (along with a port) to
	  send an outgoing INVITE to when dialing a SIP peer. This goes
	  hand-in-hand with func_srv. You can query SRV records and then
	  use the host and port from the results to dial via a specific
	  host instead of what is configured in sip.conf. Review:

	  "Invalid ACL" This attempts to read a bunch of badly formatted
	  ACL entries and add them to a host access rule. The goal of this
	  test is to be sure that all invalid entries are rejected as they
	  should be. 2. "ACL" This sets up four ACLs. One is a permit all,
	  one is a deny all, and the other two have specific rules about
	  which subnets are allowed and which are not. Then a set of test
	  addresses is used to determine whether we would allow those
	  addresses to access us when each ACL is applied. This test, by
	  the way, was what resulted in AST-2010-003's creation. Review:

	  2010) | 44 lines Several fixes regarding RFC2833 DTMF detection.
	  Here is a copy and paste of the details from my request on
	  reviewboard that dealt with these changes: Fix 1. The first
	  change in place is to fix Mantis issue 15811, which deals with a
	  situation where Asterisk will incorrectly interpret out of order
	  RFC2833 frames as duplicate DTMF digits. For instance, we would
	  receive a sequence like: seqno 1: DTMF 1 seqno 2: DTMF 1 seqno 3:
	  DTMF 1 seqno 4: DTMF 1 seqno 6: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 5: DTMF 1
	  seqno 7: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 8: DTMF 1 (end) Prior to this patch
	  when we received the frame with seqno 5, we would interpret this
	  as a new DTMF 1. With this patch, we will check the seqno of the
	  incoming digit and not process the frame if the seqno is lower
	  than the last recorded seqno. Note that we do not record the
	  seqno of the dropped DTMF frame for future processing. While the
	  above situation is what was designed to be fixed, the patch is
	  written in such a way that the following would also be fixed too:
	  seqno 9: DTMF 1 seqno 10: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 11: DTMF 1 (end)
	  seqno 13: DTMF 2 seqno 12: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 14: DTMF 2 seqno
	  15: DTMF 2 (end) seqno 16: DTMF 2 (end) seqno 17: DTMF 2 (end) In
	  this second situation, the beginning of the DTMF 2 arrives before
	  the final end frame of the DTMF 1. With the patch, seqno 12 is no
	  processed and thus we properly interpret the DTMF. Fix 2. The
	  second change in place is to fix an issue like the following:
	  seqno 1: DTMF 1 seqno 2: DTMF 1 seqno 3: DTMF 1 (end) *packet
	  lost* seqno 4: DTMF 1 (end) *packet lost* seqno 5: DTMF 1 (end)
	  *packet lost* seqno 6: DTMF 2 When we receive seqno 6, we had
	  code in place that was supposed to properly end the previously
	  unended DTMF 1. The problem was that the code was essentially a
	  no-op. The code would set up an end frame for the DTMF 1 but
	  would immediately overwrite the frame with the begin for DTMF 2.
	  I changed process_dtmf_rfc2833() so that instead of returning a
	  single frame, it is given as an output parameter a list of
	  frames. Each frame that needs to be returned is appended to this
	  list. Fix 3. The final change is a minor one where an
	  AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE frame could get lost. If we process a cisco
	  DTMF or an RFC 3389 frame and no frame was returned, then we
	  would return &ast_null_frame. The problem is that earlier in the
	  function, we may have generated an AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE frame
	  and put it in the list of frames we wish to return. This frame
	  would be lost in such a case. The patch fixes this problem

	* main/channel.c, channels/chan_sip.c, res/res_fax.c,
	  configs/sip.conf.sample, include/asterisk/frame.h,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Improve handling of T.38 re-INVITEs
	  that arrive before a T.38-capable application is executing on a
	  channel. This patch addresses an issue found during working with
	  end-users using res_fax. If an incoming call is answered in the
	  dialplan, or jumps to the 'fax' extension due to reception of a
	  CNG tone (with faxdetect enabled), and then the remote endpoint
	  sends a T.38 re-INVITE, it is possible for the channel's T.38
	  state to be 'T38_STATE_NEGOTIATING' when the application starts
	  up. Unfortunately, even if the application wants to use T.38, it
	  can't respond to the peer's negotiation request, because the
	  AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS control frame that chan_sip sent
	  originally has been lost, and the application needs the content
	  of that frame to be able to formulate a reply. This patch adds a
	  new 'request' type to AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS,
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS. If the application sends this request,
	  chan_sip will re-send the original control frame (with
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_NEGOTIATE as the request type), and the
	  application can respond as normal. If this occurs within the five
	  second timeout in chan_sip, the automatic cancellation of the
	  peer reinvite will be stopped, and the application will 'own' the
	  negotiation process from that point onwards. This also improves
	  the code path in chan_sip to allow sip_indicate(), when called
	  for AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS, to be able to return a non-zero
	  response, which should have been in place before since the
	  control frame *can* fail to be processed properly. It also
	  modifies ast_indicate() to return whatever result the channel
	  driver returned for this control frame, rather than converting
	  all non-zero results into '-1'. Finally, the new request type
	  intentionally returns a positive value, so that an application
	  that sends AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS can know for certain whether the
	  channel driver accepted it and will be replying with a control
	  frame of its own, or whether it was ignored (if the
	  sip_indicate()/ast_indicate() path had properly supported failure
	  responses before, this would not be necessary). This patch also
	  modifies res_fax to take advantage of the new request. In
	  addition, this patch makes sip_t38_abort() actually lock the
	  private structure before doing its work... bad programmer, no
	  donut. This patch also enhances chan_sip's 'faxdetect' support to
	  allow triggering on T.38 re-INVITEs received as well as CNG tone
	  detection. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/556/

	* main/pbx.c: Fix potential invalid reads that could occur in pbx.c
	  Here is a cut and paste of my review request for this change:
	  This past weekend, Russell ran our current suite of unit tests
	  for Asterisk under valgrind. The PBX pattern match test caused
	  valgrind to spew forth two invalid read errors. This patch
	  contains two changes that shut valgrind up and do not cause any
	  new memory leaks. Change 1: In
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2, valgrind reported an
	  invalid read in the for loop close to the function's end.
	  Specifically, one of the the strcmp calls in the loop control was
	  reading invalid memory. This was because the caller of
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2 (__ast_context destroy in
	  this case) passed as a parameter a shallow copy of an ast_exten's
	  exten field. This same ast_exten was what was destroyed inside
	  the for loop, thus any iterations of the for loop beyond the
	  destruction of the ast_exten would result in invalid reads. My
	  fix for this is to make a copy of the ast_exten's exten field and
	  pass the copy to ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2. In
	  addition, I have also acted similarly with the ast_exten's
	  matchcid field. Since in this case a NULL is handled quite
	  differently than an empty string, I needed to be a bit more
	  careful with its handling. Change 2: In __ast_context_destroy, we
	  iterated over a hashtab and called
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2 on each item.
	  Specifically, the hashtab over which we were iterating was an
	  ast_exten's peer_table. Inside of
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2, we could possibly destroy
	  this ast_exten, which also caused the hashtab to be freed.
	  Attempting to call ast_hashtab_end_traversal on the hashtab
	  iterator caused an invalid read to occur when trying to read the
	  iterator->tab->do_locking field since iterator->tab had already
	  been freed. My handling of this problem is a bit less
	  straightforward. With each iteration over the hashtab's contents,
	  we set a variable called "end_traversal" based on the return of
	  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2. If 0 is ever returned,
	  then we know that the extension was found and destroyed. Because
	  of this, we cannot call ast_hashtab_end_traversal because we will
	  be guaranteeing a read of invalid memory. In such a case, we
	  forego calling ast_hashtab_end_traversal and instead call
	  ast_free on the hashtab iterator. Review:

	  accuracy with warnings This changes native bridging to break one
	  millisecond early so that the more accurate timeval calculations
	  done in the generic bridge can be performed using the bridge
	  config. Currently the time between exiting native bridging
	  slightly late can sometimes cause a large enough discrepancy for
	  warnings to be missed. For the record, 1.4 does not attempt to
	  native bridge at all when warnings are enabled. (closes issue

	* codecs/Makefile, include/asterisk/logger.h, main/Makefile,
	  Makefile.moddir_rules, pbx/Makefile, res/Makefile, CHANGES,
	  channels/Makefile, include/asterisk/options.h, main/cli.c: Change
	  per-file debug and verbose levels to be per-module, the way users
	  expect them to work. 'core set debug' and 'core set verbose' can
	  optionally change the level for a specific filename; however,
	  this is actually for a specific source file name, not the module
	  that source file is included in. With examples like chan_sip,
	  chan_iax2, chan_misdn and others consisting of multiple source
	  files, this will not lead to the behavior that users expect. If
	  they want to set the debug level for chan_sip, they want it set
	  for all of chan_sip, and not to have to also set it for
	  reqresp_parser and other files that comprise the chan_sip module.
	  This patch changes this functionality to be module-name based
	  instead of file-name based. To make this work, some Makefile
	  modifications were required to ensure that the AST_MODULE
	  definition is present in each object file produced for each
	  module as well. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/574/

	  also not the first time that this mistake has been made. The
	  initial implementation of the ast_rtp_new_source function also
	  changed the ssrc--and then it was removed because of this same
	  issue. Then, we put it back in again to fix a different issue.
	  This patch attempts to only change the ssrc when we see that the

	  allocation in a string field pool. 4. Setting a string to a large
	  value such that a new string field pool must be allocated. In

	  the correct value in it), make sure that the 2 bytes before the
	  string field has the correct capacity for the field, and for
	  tests 2-4, we make sure that the string field is where we expect
	  it to be in memory. Also tested: 5. Shrinking a string field and

	* apps/app_record.c: Be less ambiguous in Record() app docs. For
	  some reason the documentation for the 'k' application in trunk
	  and 1.6.2 is different than 1.6.0 and 1.6.1, so I'm setting them
	  all to match. The wording in 1.6.2 and trunk was ambiguous, so
	  you could interpret the wording the mean that recording would
	  continue upon hangup indefinitely, or you could interpret it to
	  mean that the recorded data would not be discarded upon hangup.
	  This change makes it clear we mean the latter, and not the
	  former. Came from a discussion in #asterisk on IRC.

	  it would cause the search for a call waiting interface to be very
	  expensive and slow down D channel message servicing.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a crash in SIP blind transfer handling
	  found by an automated external test. The first real test added to
	  the external test suite found a pretty nasty crash that occurred
	  in Asterisk trunk. The crash was due to a race condition between
	  the REFER handling and channel destruction in the channel thread.
	  After the transfer has been completed, we go back to the
	  transferrer channel and try to lock it so we can fire off a CEL
	  event. However, there was no guarantee that the channel was still
	  around at that point since it's racing against the channel
	  thread. Since ast_channel is a reference counted object, the fix
	  is simple. The code unlocks the transferrer channel before
	  finally completing the transfer with an async goto. At this point
	  the channel thread is going to start call tear down and the
	  channel will eventually be destroyed. To ensure that the channel
	  is valid when we want to fire off the CEL event, increase the
	  channel's reference count.

	  consistent with other channel technologies. The processing of
	  DTMF tones on the receiving side of an ISDN channel is
	  inconsistent with the way it is handled in other channels,
	  especially DAHDI analog. This causes DTMF tones sent from an ISDN
	  phone to be doubled at the connected party. We are using the
	  following 2 options of misdn.conf 1) astdtmf=yes 2) senddtmf=yes
	  Option one is necessary because the asterisk DSP DTMF detection
	  is better than mISDN's internal DSP. Not as many false positives.
	  Option two is necessary to transmit DTMF tones end to end when
	  mISDN channels are connected to SIP channels with out of band
	  DTMF for example. The symptom is that DTMF tones sent by an ISDN
	  phone are doubled on the way through asterisk when two mISDN
	  channels are connected with a Local channel in between or if it
	  is bridged to an analog channel. The doubling of DTMF tones is
	  because DTMF is passed inband to asterisk by the mISDN channel
	  and passed out of band once again after the release of the DTMF
	  tone. Passing it inband is wrong. Neither an analog channel nor
	  SIP channel passes DTMF inband if configured to inband DTMF.
	  Analog and SIP channels filter out the DTMF tones because they
	  use the voice frames returned by ast_dsp_process. But chan_misdn
	  passes the unfiltered input voice frames instead. To overcome one
	  aspect of the problem, the doubling of DTMF tones when two mISDN
	  channels are directly bridged, someone made an 'optimization',
	  where in that case the DTMF tone passed out-of-band to the peer
	  channel is not translated to an inband tone at the transmit side.
	  This optimization is bad because it does not work in general. For
	  example, analog channels or mISDN channels when bridged through
	  an intermediary local channel will generate DTMF tones from
	  out-of-band information. Also, of course, it must not be done
	  when there is no inband DTMF available. This patch fixes the
	  issue. Now chan_misdn will filter the received inband DTMF signal
	  the same as other channel types. Another change included: No need
	  to build an extra translation path because ast_process_dsp does
	  it if required. Patches: misdn-dtmf.patch JIRA ABE-2080

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If the peer record is from realtime, it
	  could be set to 0, due to MySQL not representing NULL well in
	  integer columns. NULL means the value is not specified for the
	  column, which normally means the driver uses whatever is the
	  default value. However, on MySQL, placing a NULL in either a
	  float or integer column results in a retrieval of the 0 value.
	  Hence, users get an errant error on load. This patch suppresses
	  that error and makes the value as if it was not there. Note that
	  this cannot be done in the realtime driver, because the lack of
	  difference between NULL and 0 can only be intepreted correctly by
	  the driver itself. If we did it in the realtime driver, then it
	  would be effectively impossible to set any realtime field to 0,
	  because it would act as if the field were unspecified and
	  possibly take on a different value. (closes issue #16683)

	  | 10 lines Tweak argument handling for wget in the sounds
	  Makefile. 1) Fix the check to see if we are using wget to not be
	  full of fail. The configure script populates this variable with
	  the absolute path to wget if it is found, so it didn't work. 2)
	  Allow some extra arguments to be passed in for wget. This is just
	  a simple change to allow our Bamboo build script to tell wget to
	  be quiet and not fill up our logs with download status output.

	* main/test.c: Fix a couple of bugs in test tab completion. 1. Add
	  missing unlock of lists. 2. Swap order of arguments to
	  test_cat_cmp in complete_test_name.

	* main/test.c: Tab completion for test categories and names for
	  "test show registered" and "test execute" CLI commands.

	* main/strings.c, include/asterisk/strings.h: Fix two problems in
	  ast_str functions found while writing a unit test. 1. The
	  documentation for ast_str_set and ast_str_append state that the
	  max_len parameter may be -1 in order to limit the size of the
	  ast_str to its current allocated size. The problem was that the
	  max_len parameter in all cases was a size_t, which is unsigned.
	  Thus a -1 was interpreted as UINT_MAX instead of -1. Changing the
	  max_len parameter to be ssize_t fixed this issue. 2. Once issue 1
	  was fixed, there was an off-by-one error in the case where we
	  attempted to write a string larger than the current allotted size
	  to a string when -1 was passed as the max_len parameter. When
	  trying to write more than the allotted size, the ast_str's
	  __AST_STR_USED was set to 1 higher than it should have been.
	  Thanks to Tilghman for quickly spotting the offending line of
	  code. Oh, and the unit test that I referenced in the top line of
	  this commit will be added to reviewboard shortly. Sit tight...

	* main/channel.c: fixes sample rate conversion issue with Monitor
	  application When using ast_seekstream with the read/write streams
	  of a monitor, the number of samples we are seeking must be of the
	  same rate as the stream or the jump calculation will be
	  incorrect. This patch adds logic to correctly convert the number
	  of samples to jump to the sample rate the read/write stream is
	  using. For example, if the call is G722 (16khz) and the
	  read/write stream is recording a 8khz wav, seeking 320 samples of
	  16khz audio is not the same as seeking 320 samples of 8khz audio
	  when performing the ast_seekstream on the stream. ABE-2044

	* channels/chan_sip.c: fixes areas where port should be removed

	  converted duplicate uri parsing code to use the parse_uri
	  function. There were two instances where this conversion did not
	  mimic previous behavior exactly because the port was not being
	  parsed off the end of the domain. In order to do this, a dummy
	  pointer argument needs to be passed into parse_uri so it will
	  know it must parse out the port from the domain. If a port output
	  paramenter is not present, the domain is returned with the port
	  still attached.

	  Various updates to the unit test API. 1) It occurred to me that
	  the difference in usage between the error ast_str and the
	  ast_test_update_status() usage has turned out to be a bit
	  ambiguous in practice. In a lot of cases, the same message was
	  being sent to both. In other cases, it was only sent to one or
	  the other. My opinion now is that in every case, I think it makes
	  sense to do both; we should output it to the CLI as well as save
	  it off for logging purposes. This change results in most of the
	  changes in this diff, since it required changes to all existing
	  unit tests. It also allowed for some simplifications of unit test
	  API implementation code. 2) Update ast_test_status_update() to
	  include the file, function, and line number for the code
	  providing the update. 3) There are some formatting tweaks here
	  and there. Hopefully they aren't too distracting for code review
	  purposes. Reviewboard's diff viewer seems to do a pretty good job
	  of pointing out when something is a whitespace change. 4) I moved
	  the md5_test and sha1_test into the test_utils module. It seemed
	  like a better approach since these tests are so tiny. 5) I
	  changed the number of nodes used in heap_test_2 from 1 million to
	  100 thousand. The only reason for this was to reduce the time it
	  took for this test to run. 6) Remove an unused function prototype
	  that was at the bottom of utils.h. 7) Simplify test_insert()
	  using the LIST_INSERT_SORTALPHA() macro. The one minor difference
	  in behavior is that it no longer checks for a test registered
	  with the same name. 8) Expand the code in test_alloc() to provide
	  specific error messages for each failure case, to clearly inform
	  developers if they forget to set the name, summary, description,
	  etc. 9) Tweak the output of the "test show registered" CLI
	  command. I swapped the name and category to have the category
	  first. It seemed more natural since that is the sort key. 10)
	  Don't output the status ast_str in the "test show results" CLI
	  command. This is going to tend to be pretty verbose, so just
	  leave that for the detailed test logs (test generate results).

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Remove useless sip
	  options related to hash table size. First off, these options
	  weren't actually doing anything. By the time the options were
	  parsed, the peer and dialog containers had already been allocated
	  with their default values. Second, hash table size is something
	  that doesn't really make sense to change in a config file. If a
	  user is that interested in changing the hashtable size, he can
	  modify the source itself. I have removed the parsing of the
	  hash_peer, hash_user, and hash_dialog options. I have removed the
	  hash_user_size variable altogether since it is not used at all. I
	  also changed hash_peer_size and hash_dialog_size to be constant,
	  and have changed the symbols to be in all caps as constants
	  typically are. I have also removed the entire section in
	  sip.conf.sample regarding configurable hashtable sizes.

	  Tests - sip_parse_uri_test - sip_parse_host_test -
	  sip_parse_register_line_test Code Refactoring - All reusable
	  #define, enum, and struct definitions were moved out of
	  chan_sip.c into sip.h. During this process formatting changes
	  were made to comments in both sip.h and chan_sip.c in order to
	  better adhere to the coding guidelines. - The beginnings of three
	  new sip APIs, sip-utils.h, config-parser.h, reqresp-parser.h
	  using existing chan_sip.c functions. - parse_uri() and
	  get_calleridname() were moved from chan_sip.c to request-parser.c
	  along with unit tests for both functions. - sip_parse_host() and
	  sip_parse_register_line() were moved from chan_sip.c to
	  config-parser.c along with unit tests for both functions. Changes
	  to parse_uri() -removal of the options parameter. It was never
	  used and did not behave correctly. -additional check for
	  [?header] field. When this field was present, the transport type
	  was not being set correctly. ----- Overview ----- This patch is
	  introduced with the hope that unit tests for all our sip parsing
	  functions will be written soon. chan_sip is a huge file, and with
	  the addition of each unit test chan_sip is going to grow larger
	  and harder to maintain. I'm proposing we begin refactoring
	  chan_sip, starting with the parsing functions. With each parsing
	  function we move into a separate helper file, a unit test should
	  accompany it. I've attempted to lay down the ground work for this
	  change by creating two new parser helper files (config-parser.c
	  and reqresp-parser.c) and moving all shared structs, enums, and
	  defines from chan_sip.c into a shared sip.h file. We can't verify
	  everything in Asterisk using unit tests, but string parsing is
	  one area where unit tests make the most sense. By beginning to
	  restructure the code in this way, chan_sip not only becomes less
	  bloated, but Asterisk as a whole will become more stable. Review:

	  the format output if they are over a certain length.

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, channels/chan_sip.c, tests/test_utils.c
	  (added), main/test.c, main/utils.c: RFC compliant uri and
	  display-name encode/decode 1. URI Encoding This patch changes
	  ast_uri_encode()'s behavior when doreserved is enabled.
	  Previously when doreserved was enabled only a small set of
	  reserved characters were encoded. This set was comprised
	  primarily of the reserved characters defined in RFC3261 section
	  25.1, but contained other characters as well. Rather than only
	  escaping the reserved set, doreserved now escapes all characters
	  not within the unreserved set as defined by RFC 3261 and RFC
	  2396. Also, the 'doreserved' variable has been renamed to
	  'do_special_char' in attempts to avoid confusion. When doreserve
	  is not enabled, the previous logic of only encoding the
	  characters <= 0X1F and > 0X7f remains, except for the '%'
	  character, which must always be encoded as it signifies a HEX
	  escaped character during the decode process. 2. URI Decoding:
	  Break up URI before decode. In chan_sip.c ast_uri_decode is
	  called on the entire URI instead of it's individual parts after
	  it is parsed. This is not good as ast_uri_decode can introduce
	  special characters back into the URI which can mess up parsing.
	  This patch resolves this by not decoding a URI until parsing is
	  completely done. There are many instances where we check to see
	  if pedantic checking is enabled before we decode a URI. In these
	  cases a new macro, SIP_PEDANTIC_DECODE, is used on the individual
	  parsed segments of the URI rather than constantly putting if
	  (pedantic) { decode() } checks everywhere in the code. In the
	  areas where ast_uri_decode is not dependent upon pedantic
	  checking this macro is not used, but decoding is still moved to
	  each individual part of the URI. The only behavior that should
	  change from this patch is the time at which decoding occurs.
	  Since I had to look over every place URI parsing occurs to create
	  this patch, I found several places where we use duplicate code
	  for parsing. To consolidate the code, those areas have updated to
	  use the parse_uri() function where possible. 3. SIP display-name
	  decoding according to RFC3261 section 25. To properly decode the
	  display-name portion of a FROM header, chan_sip's
	  get_calleridname() function required a complete re-write. More
	  information about this change can be found in the comments at the
	  beginning of this function. 4. Unit Tests. Unit tests for
	  ast_uri_encode, ast_uri_decode, and get_calleridname() have been
	  written. This involved the addition of the test_utils.c file for
	  testing the utils api. (closes issue #16299) Reported by: wdoekes

	* main/utils.c: Make sure to set owner_line, ownder_func, and
	  owner_file in ast_calloc_with_stringfields. Asterisk would crash
	  on startup if MALLOC_DEBUG were set in menuselect. This is
	  because the manager action UpdateConfig had to resize its string
	  field allocation to set the description. When the resize
	  occurred, ast_copy_string would crash because we were attempting
	  to copy a string from a NULL pointer. Setting the strings
	  initially makes the code much less crashy.

	* include/asterisk/audiohook.h, main/audiohook.c: fixes
	  AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT regression During the process of removing an
	  audiohook from one channel and attaching it to another the
	  audiohook's status is updated to DONE and then back to whatever
	  it was previously. Typically updating the status after setting it
	  to DONE is not a good idea because DONE can trigger unrecoverable
	  audiohook destruction events... because of this a conditional
	  check was added to audiohook_update_status to explicitly prevent
	  the audiohook from ever changing after being set to DONE. It was
	  this check that prevented audiohook inherit from work properly
	  though. Now ast_audiohook_move_by_source is treated as a special
	  exception, as the audiohook must be returned to its previous
	  status after attaching it to the new channel. This is only a safe
	  operation because the audiohook's lock is held the entire time,
	  otherwise this could cause trouble. (closes issue #16522)

	  read position is not reset before attempting to read samples. So
	  when we seek to determine the maximum size of the file (as in
	  res_agi's STREAM FILE) we weren't then resetting the file pointer
	  so that we could properly read samples. This patch addresses that
	  (in a similar manner to format_wav.c). (closes issue #15224)

	* main/pbx.c: fixes subscriptions being lost after 'module reload'
	  During a module reload if multiple extension configs are present,
	  such as both extensions.conf and extensions.ael, watchers for one
	  config's hints will be lost during the merging of the other
	  config. This happens because hint watchers are only preserved for
	  the current config being merged. The old context list is
	  destroyed after the merging takes place, meaning any watchers
	  that were not perserved will be removed. Now all hints are
	  preserved during merging regardless of what config file is being
	  merged. These hints are only restored if they are present within
	  the new context list. (closes issue #16093) Reported by: jlaroff

	* CHANGES: Update CHANGES to reflect new QUEUE_MEMBER option,
	  "ready"

	* apps/app_queue.c: QUEUE_MEMBER(..., ready) counts only ready
	  agents, not free agents wrapping up The QUEUE_MEMBER dialplan
	  function can return total members, logged-in members and "free"
	  members count. A member is counted as "free" immediately after
	  his call ends, even though its wrap-up time, if specified in
	  queues.conf, has not yet expired, and the queue will not actually
	  route a call to it. This Patch introduces a new "ready" option
	  that only counts free agents no longer in the wrap up time
	  period. (closes issue #16240) Reported by: kkm Patches:

	* CHANGES, apps/app_queue.c: update CHANGES to reflect new 'R'

	* apps/app_queue.c: new parameter 'R' to the Queue application The
	  'R' argument stops moh and indicates ringing once the agent is
	  ringing. This allows the person in the queue to know their call
	  is potentially about to be answered. (closes issue #16384)

	  API The Unit Test Framework is a new API that manages
	  registration and execution of unit tests in Asterisk with the
	  purpose of verifying the operation of C functions. The Framework
	  consists of a single test manager accompanied by a list of
	  registered test functions defined within the code. A test is
	  defined, registered, and unregistered from the framework using a
	  set of macros which allow the test code to only be compiled
	  within asterisk when the TEST_FRAMEWORK flag is enabled in
	  menuselect. This allows the test code to exist in the same file
	  as the C functions it intends to verify. Registered tests may be
	  viewed and executed via a set of new CLI commands. CLI commands
	  are also present for generating and exporting test results into
	  xml and txt formats. For more information and use cases please
	  refer to the documentation provided at the beginning of the
	  test.h file. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/447/

	  modules. A recent change to app_voicemail made it such that the
	  module now assumes that all format modules are available while
	  processing voicemail configuration. However, when autoloading
	  modules, it was possible that app_voicemail was loaded before the
	  format modules. Since format modules don't depend on anything,
	  set a module load priority on them to ensure that they get loaded
	  first when autoloading. This fix applies to trunk, 1.6.1, and
	  1.6.2. The fix for 1.4 and 1.6.0 will require a different
	  approach since the module load priority functionality is not
	  present in the module API. (issue #16412) Reported by: jiddings

	  happening as a result of a frame containing an invalid data
	  pointer, but was set with data length of zero. The few times the
	  issue was reproduced it _seemed_ that the frame was queued
	  properly, that is the data pointer was set to NULL. I never could

	* main/udptl.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/udptl.h:
	  Another round of UDPTL stack fixes/improvements: 1) Allow users
	  of UDPTL stack to associate a character-string tag with a UDPTL
	  session, so that log/error/debug messages generated by the UDPTL
	  stack can be 'connected' to the endpoint that caused them to be
	  generated. 2) Improve comments (and process) of calculating the
	  far end's maximum IFP size when redundancy mode is in use for
	  error correction. 3) When an IFP larger than the calculated 'far
	  max IFP' size is presented for writing, truncate it rather than
	  putting in the buffer and allowing the buffer to overflow; this
	  will cause the ends to retrain to a lower bit rate that produces
	  IFPs of an appropriate size if possible, and if not possible, the
	  FAX transfer will fail completely. In these cases, it is due to
	  the one endpoint supplying a T38FaxMaxDatagram value that is
	  improperly calculated and is too low to be of use; we have
	  configuration options available to override this behavior. 4)
	  Eliminate use of T38FaxMaxDatagram value in udptl.conf; it is no
	  longer needed.

	  change The logic to detect if a requested file is indeed a
	  different file from the current file was incorrect. The main
	  issue being confusion of the use of filename_base which was
	  previously set without pathing information and then compared to
	  another full path. Robust file comparison logic has been added to
	  properly check if two files are the same even if symlinks are
	  used. (closes issue #15313) Reported by: caspy Patches:

	* channels/sig_pri.h, channels/chan_dahdi.c, UPGRADE.txt,
	  channels/sig_pri.c: DAHDI ISDN channel names will not allow
	  device state to work. (Interim solution.) Since ISDN works like
	  SIP and not analog ports in regard to devices, the device state
	  based on the ISDN channel number could not work. This has not
	  been an issue until the advent of PTMP NT mode. Previously, ISDN
	  lines were used as trunks and did not have to keep track of
	  specific devices. As an interim solution until device states are
	  properly implemented, the channel name is being changed to the
	  following format to use the generic device state support:
	  DAHDI/i<span>/<number>[:<subaddress>]-<sequence-number> Dialplan
	  hints would thus be: exten => xxx,hint,DAHDI/i2/5551212 This will
	  work with the following restrictions: * The number of
	  devices/phones cannot exceed the number of B channels. (i.e., BRI
	  has 2) * Each device/phone can only have one number. No shared

	* main/tcptls.c, channels/chan_sip.c, apps/app_externalivr.c,
	  include/asterisk/tcptls.h: SIP TCP/TLS: move client connection
	  setup/write into tcp helper thread, various related
	  locking/memory fixes. What this patch fixes 1.Moves sip TCP/TLS
	  connection setup into the TCP helper thread: Connection setup
	  takes awhile and before this it was being done while holding the
	  monitor lock. 2.Moves TCP/TLS writing to the TCP helper thread:
	  Through the use of a packet queue and an alert pipe, the TCP
	  helper thread can now be woken up to write data as well as read
	  data. 3.Locking error: sip_xmit returned an XMIT_ERROR without
	  giving up the tcptls_session lock. This lock has been completely
	  removed from sip_xmit and placed in the new sip_tcptls_write()
	  function. 4.Memory leak: When creating a tcptls_client the
	  tls_cfg was alloced but never freed unless the tcptls_session
	  failed to start. Now the session_args for a sip client are an ao2
	  object which frees the tls_cfg on destruction. 5.Pointer to stack
	  variable: During sip_prepare_socket the creation of a client's
	  ast_tcptls_session_args was done on the stack and stored as a
	  pointer in the newly created tcptls_session. Depending on the
	  events that followed, there was a slight possibility that pointer
	  could have been accessed after the stack returned. Given the new
	  changes, it is always accessed after the stack returns which is
	  why I found it. Notable code changes 1.I broke tcptls.c's
	  ast_tcptls_client_start() function into two functions. One for
	  creating and allocating the new tcptls_session, and a separate
	  one for starting and handling the new connection. This allowed me
	  to create the tcptls_session, launch the helper thread, and then
	  establish the connection within the helper thread. 2.Writes to a
	  tcptls_session are now done within the helper thread. This is
	  done by using an alert pipe to wake up the thread if new data
	  needs to be sent. The thread's sip_threadinfo object contains the
	  alert pipe as well as the packet queue. 3.Since the threadinfo
	  object contains the alert pipe, it must now be accessed outside
	  of the helper thread for every write (queuing of a packet). For
	  easy lookup, I moved the threadinfo objects from a linked list to
	  an ao2_container. (closes issue #13136) Reported by: pabelanger

	  supported). In addition, it converts ast_channel_iterators (only
	  the targeted versions, not the ones that iterate over all
	  channels) to use this method. During this work, I removed the
	  'ao2_flags' arguments to the ast_channel_iterator constructor
	  functions; there were no uses of that argument yet, there is only
	  one possible flag to pass, and it made the iterators less
	  'opaque'. If at some point in the future someone really needs an
	  ast_channel_iterator that does not lock the container, we can
	  provide constructor(s) for that purpose. Review:

	  Oct 2009) | 44 lines Make filestream frame handling safer by
	  isolating frames before returning them. This patch is related to
	  a number of issues on the bug tracker that show crashes related
	  to freeing frames that came from a filestream. A number of fixes
	  have been made over time while trying to figure out these
	  problems, but there re still people seeing the crash. (Note that
	  some of these bug reports include information about other
	  problems. I am specifically addressing the filestream frame crash
	  here.) I'm still not clear on what the exact problem is. However,
	  what is _very_ clear is that we have seen quite a few problems
	  over time related to unexpected behavior when we try to use
	  embedded frames as an optimization. In some cases, this
	  optimization doesn't really provide much due to improvements made
	  in other areas. In this case, the patch modifies filestream
	  handling such that the embedded frame will not be returned.
	  ast_frisolate() is used to ensure that we end up with a
	  completely mallocd frame. In reality, though, we will not
	  actually have to malloc every time. For filestreams, the frame
	  will almost always be allocated and freed in the same thread.
	  That means that the thread local frame cache will be used. So,
	  going this route doesn't hurt. With this patch in place, some
	  people have reported success in not seeing the crash anymore.

	  Deadlock in channel masquerade handling Channels are stored in an
	  ao2_container. When accessing an item within an ao2_container the
	  proper locking order is to first lock the container, and then the
	  items within it. In ast_do_masquerade both the clone and original
	  channel must be locked for the entire duration of the function.
	  The problem with this is that it attemptes to unlink and link

	  channel's name changes. This is invalid locking order as the
	  process of unlinking and linking will lock the ao2_container
	  while the channels are locked!!! Now, both the channels in
	  do_masquerade are unlinked from the ao2_container and then locked
	  for the entire function. At the end of the function both channels
	  are unlocked and linked back into the container with their new
	  names as hash values. This new method of requiring all channels
	  and tech pvts to be unlocked before ast_do_masquerade() or

	* main/udptl.c, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/udptl.conf.sample,
	  UPGRADE.txt, configs/sip.conf.sample: Allow non-compliant T.38
	  endpoints to be supportable via configuration option. Many T.38
	  endpoints incorrectly send the maximum IFP frame size they can
	  accept as the T38FaxMaxDatagram value in their SDP, when in fact
	  this value is supposed to be the maximum UDPTL payload size
	  (datagram size) they can accept. If the value they supply is
	  small enough (a commonly supplied value is '72'), T.38 UDPTL
	  transmissions will likely fail completely because the UDPTL
	  packets will not have enough room for a primary IFP frame and the
	  redundancy used for error correction. If this occurs, the
	  Asterisk UDPTL stack will emit log messages warning that data
	  loss may occur, and that the value may need to be overridden.
	  This patch extends the 't38pt_udptl' configuration option in
	  sip.conf to allow the administrator to override the value
	  supplied by the remote endpoint and supply a value that allows
	  T.38 FAX transmissions to be successful with that endpoint. In
	  addition, in any SIP call where the override takes effect, a
	  debug message will be printed to that effect. This patch also
	  removes the T38FaxMaxDatagram configuration option from
	  udptl.conf.sample, since it has not actually had any effect for a
	  number of releases. In addition, this patch cleans up the T.38
	  documentation in sip.conf.sample (which incorrectly documented
	  that T.38 support was passthrough only). (issue #15586) Reported

	  ability to configure it in udptl.conf, but issues a warning if
	  the user tries to do, telling them to look at sip.conf.sample for
	  how to configure it now. For any SIP peers that are T.38 enabled
	  in sip.conf, there is already a default for FEC error correction
	  even if the user does not specify any mode, so this change will
	  not turn off error correction by default, it will have the same
	  default value that has been in the udptl.conf sample file.

	  changes Asterisk doesn't honor marker bit when reinvited to

	  packets with "old" timestamps that areactually part of a new
	  stream. This patch sends AST_CONTROL_SRCUPDATE whenever there is
	  a reinvite, unless the 'constantssrc' is set to true in sip.conf.
	  The original issue reported to Digium support detailed the
	  following situation: ITSP <-> Asterisk 1.4.26.2 <-> SIP-based
	  Application Server Call comes in fromITSP, Asterisk dials the app
	  server which sends a re-invite back toAsterisk--not to negotiate
	  to send media directly to the ITSP, but to indicatethat it's
	  changing the stream it's sending to Asterisk. The app
	  servergenerates a new SSRC, sequence numbers, timestamps, and
	  sets the marker bit on the new stream. Asterisk passes through
	  the teimstamp of the new stream, butdoes not reset the SSRC,
	  sequence numbers, or set the marker bit. When the timestamp on
	  the new stream is older than the timestamp on the originalstream,
	  the ITSP (which doesn't know there has been any change) discards
	  the newframes because it thinks they are too old. This patch
	  addresses this by changing the SSRC on a stream update unless
	  constantssrc=true is set in sip.conf. Review:

	  patterns being first in line for matching, but it will usually
	  get the job done. This patch merely brings CID matching to the
	  same level as extension matching. This patch does not attempt to
	  tackle the problem shared by extension matching. (closes issue

	  The security release mistakenly moved IE parsing before

	  this, decryption of full frames is once again done before looking
	  into the frame. This involves searching for an existing callno,

	  decrypting the packet before the internal fields of the full

	  lines Make apps send PROGRESS control frame for early media and
	  fix too early media issue in SIP The issue at hand is that some
	  legacy (dying) PBX systems send empty media frames on PRI links
	  *before* any call progress. The SIP channel receives these frames
	  and by default signals 183 Session progress and starts sending
	  media. This will cause phones to play silence and ignore the
	  later 180 ringing message. A bad user experience. The fix is
	  twofold: - We discovered that asterisk apps that support early
	  media ("noanswer") did not send any PROGRESS frame to indicate
	  early media. Fixed. - We introduce a setting in chan_sip so that
	  users can disable any relay of media frames before the outbound
	  channel actually indicates any sort of call progress. In 1.4,
	  1.6.0 and 1.6.1, this will be disabled for backward
	  compatibility. In later versions of Asterisk, this will be
	  enabled. We don't assume that it will change your Asterisk phone
	  experience - only for the better. We encourage third-party
	  application developers to make sure that if they have
	  applications that wants to send early media, add a PROGRESS
	  control frame transmission to make sure that all channel drivers
	  actually will start sending early media. This has not been the
	  default in Asterisk previous to this patch, so if you got
	  inspiration from our code, you need to update accordingly. Sorry
	  for the trouble and thanks for your support. This code has been
	  running for a few months in a large scale installation (over 250
	  servers with PRI and/or BRI links to old PBX systems). That's no
	  proof that this is an excellent patch, but, well, it's tested :-)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Do not treat every SIP peer as if they were
	  configured with insecure=port. There was a problem in the
	  function responsible for doing peer matching by IP address and
	  port number such that during the second pass for checking for a
	  peer configured with insecure=port, it would end up treating
	  every peer as if it had been configured that way. These changes
	  fix the logic in the peer IP and port comparison callback to
	  handle insecure=port checking properly. This problem was
	  introduced when SIP peers were converted to astobj2. Many thanks
	  to dvossel for noticing this while working on another peer
	  matching issue.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: SIP support for keep-alive event keep-alive
	  events are used by Sipura/Linksys for NAT keepalive. There
	  currently don't appear to be any problems with NAT, but everytime
	  a keep-alive event is received, Asterisk responds with a "489 Bad
	  event". This error may indicate to a user that NAT problems exist
	  just because this even is not supported. Now, rather than respond
	  with an error, the packet is consumed and a "200 ok" is sent just
	  to indicate we received the packet. (issue #15084) Patches:

	* addons/format_mp3.c: Fix memory corruption caused by format_mp3.
	  format_mp3 claimed that it provided AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET in frames
	  returned by read(). However, it lied. This means that other parts
	  of the code that attempted to make use of the offset buffer would
	  end up corrupting the fields in the ast_filestream structure.
	  This resulted in quite a few crashes due to unexpected values for
	  fields in ast_filestream. This patch closes out quite a few bugs.
	  However, some of these bugs have been open for a while and have
	  been an area where more than one bug has been discussed. So with
	  that said, anyone that is following one of the issues closed
	  here, if you still have a problem, please open a new bug report
	  for the specific problem you are still having. If you do, please
	  ensure that the bug report is based on the newest version of

	* include/asterisk.h, main/poll.c: Various patches, to enable

	  certain behaviors on Linux, it works differently on *BSD
	  platforms to REMOVE certain API calls that are not in the POSIX
	  specification, such as vasprintf(3). Thus, defining it while
	  depending upon vasprintf (and other extensions to the POSIX
	  standard) to be defined is a recipe to ensure that Asterisk is
	  only buildable on Linux. Hence, this define which was meant to
	  INCREASE portability, effectively ensures the opposite.

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,

	  continue with. The problem was the returned audiohook frame was
	  not being handled at all, and the original frame passed into it
	  did not contain the mixed audio, so essentially audio was being
	  lost. One result of this was chan_spy's whisper mode no longer
	  worked. To complicate the issue, frames passed into ast_write may
	  either be a single frame, or a list of frames. So, as the list of
	  frames is processed in the audiohook_write, the returned frames
	  had to be added to a new list. (closes issue #15660) Reported by:

	* main/channel.c: Fix up some issues with getting a channel by
	  "name". Even though the get_channel_by_name() API advertised that
	  you could search by name or uniqueid (just as the old API did),
	  searching by uniqueid was not actually implemented. This patch
	  fixes that problem. The ast_channel_get_full() function now makes
	  a second search attempt by uniqueid if the parameter was a name.
	  The channel comparison function also now knows how to compare by
	  unqieueid. Finally, a bug was fixed in passing where OBJ_POINTER
	  was being passed in some scenarios where it should not have been.

	  UDPRedundancy as the error correction mode, we'll end up
	  calculating a tiny maximum IFP size, so small as to be unusable.
	  This patch sets a lower bound on what we'll consider the remote's
	  maximum IFP size to be, assuming that endpoints that do this
	  really can accept larger packets than they've offered to accept.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample: Add configuration sample code for
	  previous commit.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Improve chan_sip's ability to determine what
	  methods should and should not be used in a dialog. The previous
	  effort here was to store what a peer is capable of receiving by
	  parsing REGISTER requests from the peer and keeping that
	  information for as long as the registration was active. The
	  problem with this is that there are a great number of SIP devices
	  which give no indication of the methods allowed in their REGISTER
	  requests, and it is unreasonable to try to guess what the device
	  may or may not support. In addition, some SIP devices have been
	  found to claim support for a specific method, but their handling
	  the method is less than ideal, or they are actually lying. With
	  this patch, we now determine what methods a device supports by
	  parsing the Allow header we receive from them, and we do this
	  with each new dialog. In addition, a configuration option has
	  been added so that an administrator can essentially blacklist
	  certain methods from being used with certain peers if the admin
	  knows that support for a specific method is dodgy or nonexistent.

	  if desired. There are some VoIP providers out there that will not
	  accept SDP offers with odd numbered UDPTL ports. While it is my
	  personal opinion that these VoIP providers are misinterpreting
	  RFC 2327, it really is not a big deal to play along with their
	  silly little games. Of course, since restricting UDPTL ports to
	  only even numbers reduces the range of available ports by half,
	  so the option to use only even port numbers is off by default. A
	  user can enable the behavior by setting use_even_ports=yes in
	  udptl.conf. (closes issue #15182) Reported by: CGMChris Patches:

	* Makefile: Restore explicit export of ASTCFLAGS/ASTLDFLAGS and
	  underscore-variants to sub-makes. During the recent Makefile
	  improvements I made, it seemed the 'make' was automatically
	  carrying down the ASTCFLAGS/ASTLDFLAGS settings to sub-makes, so
	  I removed the explict export of them. However, there are some
	  circumstances where make does this, and some where it does not,
	  so I've brought them back to ensure they are always exported. I
	  also removed an extraneous double setting of _ASTLDFLAGS on *BSD
	  platforms.

	  channels/chan_sip.c, apps/app_fax.c, UPGRADE.txt,
	  include/asterisk/udptl.h, include/asterisk/frame.h: Rework of
	  T.38 negotiation and UDPTL API to address interoperability
	  problems Over the past couple of months, a number of issues with
	  Asterisk negotiating (and successfully completing) T.38 sessions
	  with various endpoints have been found. This patch attempts to
	  address many of them, primarily focused around ensuring that the
	  endpoints' MaxDatagram size is honored, and in addition by
	  ensuring that T.38 session parameter negotiation is performed
	  correctly according to the ITU T.38 Recommendation. The major
	  changes here are: 1) T.38 applications in Asterisk (app_fax) only
	  generate/receive IFP packets, they do not ever work with UDPTL
	  packets. As a result of this, they cannot be allowed to generate
	  packets that would overflow the other endpoints' MaxDatagram size
	  after the UDPTL stack adds any error correction information. With
	  this patch, the application is told the maximum *IFP* size it can
	  generate, based on a calculation using the far end MaxDatagram
	  size and the active error correction mode on the T.38 session.
	  The same is true for sending *our* MaxDatagram size to the remote
	  endpoint; it is computed from the value that the application says
	  it can accept (for a single IFP packet) combined with the active
	  error correction mode. 2) All treatment of T.38 session
	  parameters as 'capabilities' in chan_sip has been removed; these
	  parameters are not at all like audio/video stream capabilities.
	  There are strict rules to follow for computing an answer to a
	  T.38 offer, and chan_sip now follows those rules, using the
	  desired parameters from the application (or channel) that wants
	  to accept the T.38 negotiation. 3) chan_sip now stores and
	  forwards ast_control_t38_parameters structures for tracking 'our'
	  and 'their' T.38 session parameters; this greatly simplifies
	  negotiation, especially for pass-through calls. 4) Since T.38
	  negotiation without specifying parameters or receiving the final
	  negotiated parameters is not very worthwhile, the AST_CONTROL_T38
	  control frame has been removed. A note has been added to
	  UPGRADE.txt about this removal, since any out-of-tree
	  applications that use it will no longer function properly until
	  they are upgraded to use AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS. Review:

	  videosupport is not enabled. Copied from Review board: In issue
	  12434, the reporter describes a situation in which audio and
	  video is offered on the call, but because videosupport is
	  disabled in sip.conf, Asterisk gives no response at all to the
	  video offer. According to RFC 3264, all media offers should have
	  a corresponding answer. For offers we do not intend to actually
	  reply to with meaningful values, we should still reply with the
	  port for the media stream set to 0. In this patch, we take note
	  of what types of media have been offered and save the information
	  on the sip_pvt. The SDP in the response will take into account
	  whether media was offered. If we are not otherwise going to
	  answer a media offer, we will insert an appropriate m= line with
	  the port set to 0. It is important to note that this patch is
	  pretty much a bandage being applied to a broken bone. The patch
	  *only* helps for situations where video is offered but
	  videosupport is disabled and when udptl_pt is disabled but T.38
	  is offered. Asterisk is not guaranteed to respond to every media
	  offer. Notable cases are when multiple streams of the same type
	  are offered. The 2 media stream limit is still present with this
	  patch, too. In trunk and the 1.6.X branches, things will be a bit
	  different since Asterisk also supports text in SDPs as well.

	  .......... r207316 | rmudgett | 2009-07-17 23:05:05 -0500 (Fri,
	  17 Jul 2009) | 20 lines Fixed incoming calls being matched to
	  MSNs without type-of-number prefix added. For an incoming ISDN
	  call the dialed.number is incorrectly matched against the
	  configured MSNs in misdn.conf. The numbers passed to the dialplan
	  include the configured prefix for the dialed.number_type, whereas
	  the check against the configured MSNs (to decide if the call is
	  accepted at all), is executed without the configured prefix.
	  e.g., dialed.number = 241168020, TON = national, configured
	  national prefix is "0". (This is the TON which is used by ISDN
	  providers in the Netherlands.) In chan_misdn.c:cb_events() in
	  case EVENT_SETUP the call to misdn_cfg_is_msn_valid() uses the
	  unnormalized number 241168020, but 57 lines later the call to
	  read_config() adds the prefix, and the dialed.number is now
	  0241168020, which is then used in the dialplan.
	  misdn_cfg_is_msn_valid() must use the normalized number, too.

	  .......... Fixed chan_misdn crash because mISDNuser library is
	  not thread safe. With Asterisk the mISDNuser library is driven by
	  two threads concurrently: 1.
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c::manager_event_handler() 2.
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c::misdn_lib_isdn_event_catcher() Calls
	  into the library are done concurrently and recursively from
	  isdn_lib.c. Both threads can fiddle with the master/child
	  layer3_proc_t lists. One thread may traverse the list when the
	  other interrupts it and then removes the list element which the
	  first thread was currently handling. This is exactly what caused
	  the crash. About 60 calls were needed to a Gigaset CX475 before
	  it occurred once. This patch adds locking when calling into the
	  mISDNuser library. This also fixes some cb_log calls with wrong
	  port parameter. JIRA ABE-1913 Patches: misdn-locking.patch

	  include/asterisk/security_events_defs.h (added),
	  res/res_security_log.c (added), tests/test_ami_security_events.sh
	  (added): Add an API for reporting security events, and a security
	  event logging module. This commit introduces the security events
	  API. This API is to be used by Asterisk components to report
	  events that have security implications. A simple example is when
	  a connection is made but fails authentication. These events can
	  be used by external tools manipulate firewall rules or something
	  similar after detecting unusual activity based on security
	  events. Inside of Asterisk, the events go through the ast_event
	  API. This means that they have a binary encoding, and it is easy
	  to write code to subscribe to these events and do something with
	  them. One module is provided that is a subscriber to these events
	  - res_security_log. This module turns security events into a
	  parseable text format and sends them to the "security" logger
	  level. Using logger.conf, these log entries may be sent to a
	  file, or to syslog. One service, AMI, has been fully updated for
	  reporting security events. AMI was chosen as it was a fairly
	  straight forward service to convert. The next target will be
	  chan_sip. That will be more complicated and will be done as its
	  own project as the next phase of security events work. For more
	  information on the security events framework, see the
	  documentation generated from doc/tex/. "make asterisk.pdf"

	  | 31 lines SIP registration auth loop caused by stale nonce If an
	  endpoint sends two registration requests in a very short period
	  of time with the same nonce, both receive 401 responses from
	  Asterisk, each with a different nonce (the second 401 containing
	  the current nonce and the first one being stale). If the endpoint
	  responds to the first 401, it does not match the current nonce so
	  Asterisk sends a third 401 with a newly generated nonce (which
	  updates the current nonce)... Now if the endpoint responds to the
	  second 401, it does not match the current nonce either and
	  Asterisk sends a fourth 401 with a newly generated nonce... This
	  loop goes on and on. There appears to be a simple fix for this.
	  If the nonce from the request does not match our nonce, but is a
	  good response to a previous nonce, instead of sending a 401 with
	  a newly generated nonce, use the current one instead. This breaks
	  the loop as the nonce is not updated until a response is
	  received. Additional logic has been added to make sure no nonce
	  can be responded to twice though. (closes issue #15102) Reported

	* apps/app_fax.c: Eliminate extraneous LOG_DEBUG messages generated
	  by app_fax. The transmit_audio() and transmit_t38() functions in
	  app_fax have processing loops that are supposed to wait for
	  frames to arrive on the channel and then handle them, but they
	  also have short timeouts so that the loops can have watchdog
	  timers and do other required processing. This commit changes the
	  loops to not actually call ast_read() and attempt to process the
	  returned frame unless a frame actually arrived, eliminating
	  hundreds of LOG_DEBUG messages and slightly improving
	  performance.

	  Repair ability of SendFAX/ReceiveFAX to respond to T.38
	  switchover. Recent changes in T.38 negotiation in Asterisk caused
	  these applications to not respond when the other endpoint
	  initiated a switchover to T.38; this resulted in the T.38
	  switchover failing, and the FAX attempt to be made using an audio
	  connection, instead of T.38 (which would usually cause the FAX to
	  fail completely). This patch corrects this problem, and the
	  applications will now correctly respond to the T.38 switchover
	  request. In addition, the response will include the appopriate
	  T.38 session parameters based on what the other end offered and
	  what our end is capable of. (closes issue #14849) Reported by:

	  Move OpenSSL initialization to a single place, make library usage
	  thread-safe. While doing some reading about OpenSSL, I noticed a
	  couple of things that needed to be improved with our usage of
	  OpenSSL. 1) We had initialization of the library done in multiple
	  modules. This has now been moved to a core function that gets
	  executed during Asterisk startup. We already link OpenSSL into
	  the core for TCP/TLS functionality, so this was the most logical
	  place to do it. 2) OpenSSL is not thread-safe by default.
	  However, making it thread safe is very easy. We just have to
	  provide a couple of callbacks. One callback returns a thread ID.
	  The other handles locking. For more information, start with the
	  "Is OpenSSL thread-safe?" question on the FAQ page of
	  openssl.org.

	  good reason why we can't just put these modules in Asterisk?".
	  After a brief discussion, as long as the modules are clearly set
	  aside in their own directory and not enabled by default, it is
	  perfectly fine. For more information about why a module goes in
	  addons, see README-addons.txt. chan_ooh323 does not currently
	  compile as it is behind some trunk API updates. However, it will
	  not build by default, so it should be okay for now.

	  2009) | 22 lines Fix a problem where chan_sip would ignore "old"
	  but valid responses. chan_sip has had a problem for quite a long
	  time that would manifest when Asterisk would send multiple SIP
	  responses on the same dialog before receiving a response. The
	  problem occurred because chan_sip only kept track of the highest
	  outgoing sequence number used on the dialog. If Asterisk sent two
	  requests out, and a response arrived for the first request sent,
	  then Asterisk would ignore the response. The result was that
	  Asterisk would continue retransmitting the requests and ignoring
	  the responses until the maximum number of retransmissions had
	  been reached. The fix here is to rearrange the code a bit so that
	  instead of simply comparing the sequence number of the response
	  to our latest outgoing sequence number, we walk our list of
	  outstanding packets and determine if there is a match. If there
	  is, we continue. If not, then we ignore the response. In doing
	  this, I found a few completely useless variables that I have now
	  removed. (closes issue #11231) Reported by: flefoll Review:

	* main/channel.c, include/asterisk/channel.h: Allow trunk to once

	* configs/cel_adaptive_odbc.conf.sample: Remove invalid entries in

	  needed semicolon prefixes, but in reality, the adaptive layer is
	  designed to allow arbitrary CDR variables, without needing the
	  use of a userfield to store multiple items. It's therefore not
	  only invalid syntax but also goes against the intent of the
	  adaptive method.

	  | 16 lines The ISDN CPE side should not exclusively pick B
	  channels normally. Before this patch, Asterisk unconditionally
	  picked B channels exclusively on the CPE side and normally
	  allowed alternative B channels on the network side. Now Asterisk
	  does the opposite. Reasons for the CPE side to normally not pick
	  B channels exclusively: * For CPE point-to-multipoint mode (i.e.
	  phone side), the CPE side does not have enough information to
	  exclusively pick B channels. (There may be other devices on the
	  line.) * Q.931 gives preference to the network side picking B

	* include/asterisk/syslog.h, main/syslog.c: Add functions to map
	  syslog facilities and priorities constants to strings. Also
	  change the default casing of the string contants to lowercase.
	  This really just saves us from have to lowercase them later when
	  displaying them.

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  main/syslog.c: Add checks in configure for non-POSIX syslog
	  facilities.

	  cleaning up the header inclusion process in logger.c.

	  outgoing_colp parameter is set to not send COLP information, then
	  it does not make sense to send redirecting or transfer messages
	  announcing new COLP information that is blocked. The service
	  provider may supply the listed number for that line when it
	  passes the messages to the next hop. Why tell the switch that
	  these events happened when the information is otherwise

	  2009) | 26 lines Fix a situation in which Asterisk would not stop
	  retransmitting 487s. If a CANCEL were received by Asterisk, we
	  would send a 487 in response to the original INVITE and a 200 OK
	  for the CANCEL. If there were a network hiccup which caused the
	  200 OK and the 487 to be lost, then the UA communicating with
	  Asterisk may try to retransmit its CANCEL. Asterisk's response to
	  this used to be to try sending another 487 to the canceled INVITE
	  and another 200 OK to the CANCEL. The problem here is that the
	  originally-sent 487 was sent "reliably" meaning that it will be
	  retransmitted until it is received properly. So when we receive
	  the second CANCEL it is likely that the first batch of 487s we
	  sent is still going strong and reaches the UA. The result was
	  that the second set of 487s would be retransmitted constantly
	  until the maximum number of retries had been reached. The fix for
	  this is that if we receive a second CANCEL for an INVITE, then we
	  cancel the retransmission of the first set of 487s and start a
	  second set. This causes the dialog to be terminated reasonably.

	  reloads of non files mode MoH classes. For Music on Hold classes
	  that are not files mode, meaning that we are executing an
	  application that will feed us audio data, we use a thread to
	  monitor the external application and read audio from it. This
	  thread also makes use of the MoH class object. In the MoH class
	  destructor, we used pthread_cancel() to ask the thread to exit.
	  Unfortunately, the code did not wait to ensure that the thread
	  actually went away. What needed to be done is a pthread_join() to
	  ensure that the thread fully cleans up before we proceed. By
	  adding this one line, we resolve two significant problems: 1)
	  Since the thread was never joined, it never fully goes away. So,
	  on every reload of non-files mode MoH, an unused thread was
	  sticking around. 2) There was a race condition here where the

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix problem with no audio due to ignoring

	  not function on some calls. This was because of a test wherein we

	  a dumb comparison and arguably the compiler should have warned

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c, channels/chan_sip.c, apps/app_fax.c,
	  include/asterisk/frame.h: Enable applications to enable/disable
	  digit and tone detection. Some applications (notably app_fax) do
	  not need digit detection nor FAX tone detection while they are
	  running, and if Asterisk is using software DSPs to provide the
	  detection, this consumes extra CPU cycles that could be better
	  spent on the actual application. This patch allows applications
	  to query and control the state of digit and tone detection on a
	  channel, and modifies app_fax to disable them while the FAX
	  operations are occurring (and re-enable digit detection
	  afterwards).

	* configure, configure.ac: Explicitly test for 'static weakref'

	  versions support them, test for that combination explicitly.

	* Makefile: When compiling in an Emacs-spawned shell, always print
	  directory names. This change ensures that Emacs can find the
	  proper source files when parsing compiler error messages, since

	* channels/chan_sip.c: SIP transport type issues What this patch
	  addresses: 1. ast_sip_ouraddrfor() by default binds to the UDP
	  address/port reguardless if the sip->pvt is of type UDP or not.
	  Now when no remapping is required, ast_sip_ouraddrfor() checks
	  the sip_pvt's transport type, attempting to set the address and
	  port to the correct TCP/TLS bindings if necessary. 2. It is not
	  necessary to send the port number in the Contact header unless
	  the port is non-standard for the transport type. This patch fixes
	  this and removes the todo note. 3. In sip_alloc(), the default
	  dialog built always uses transport type UDP. Now sip_alloc()
	  looks at the sip_request (if present) and determines what
	  transport type to use by default. 4. When changing the transport
	  type of a sip_socket, the file descriptor must be set to -1 and
	  in some cases the tcptls_session's ref count must be decremented
	  and set to NULL. I've encountered several issues associated with
	  this process and have created a function, set_socket_transport(),
	  to handle the setting of the socket type. (closes issue #13865)

	* configure, autoconf/ast_gcc_attribute.m4: Ensure that
	  configure-script testing for compiler attributes actually works.
	  The configure script tests for compiler attributes didn't
	  actually enable enough warnings or provide a proper test harness
	  to determine whether the compiler supports the attribute in
	  question or not; this caused gcc 4.1 to report that it supports
	  'weakref', but it doesn't actually support it in the way that is
	  needed for our optional API mechanism. The new configure script
	  test will properly distinguish between full support and partial
	  support for this attribute, among others.

	* CHANGES: Document the new automatic 'ignoresdpversion' behavior.
	  Asterisk will now automatically ignore incorrect incoming SDP
	  version numbers when necessary to complete a T.38 re-INVITE
	  operation.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Accept T.38 re-INVITE responses with invalid
	  SDP versions. This commit changes the 'incoming SDP version'
	  check logic a bit more; when 'ignoresdpversion' is *not* set for
	  a peer, if we initiate a re-INVITE to switch to T.38, we'll
	  always accept the peer's SDP response, even if they don't
	  properly increment the SDP version number as they should. If this
	  situation occurs, a warning message will be generated suggesting
	  that the peer's configuration be changed to include the
	  'ignoresdpversion' configuration option (although ideally they'd
	  fix their SIP implementation to be RFC compliant). AST-221

	  addition, there is now a functional (and tested!) implementation
	  for Mac OS/X, so module writers no longer need to use special
	  tests before calling optional API functions. All future
	  implementations must provide these same semantics, so that module
	  writers can rely on them.

	  2009) | 40 lines Safely handle AMI connections/reload requests
	  that occur during startup. During asterisk startup, a lock on the
	  list of modules is obtained by the primary thread while each
	  module is initialized. Issue 13778 pointed out a problem with
	  this approach, however. Because the AMI is loaded before other
	  modules, it is possible for a module reload to be issued by a
	  connected client (via Action: Command), causing a deadlock. The
	  resolution for 13778 was to move initialization of the manager to
	  happen after the other modules had already been lodaded. While
	  this fixed this particular issue, it caused a problem for users
	  (like FreePBX) who call AMI scripts via an #exec in a
	  configuration file (See issue 15189). The solution I have come up
	  with is to defer any reload requests that come in until after the
	  server is fully booted. When a call comes in to ast_module_reload
	  (from wherever) before we are fully booted, the request is added
	  to a queue of pending requests. Once we are done booting up, we
	  then execute these deferred requests in turn. Note that I have
	  tried to make this a bit more intelligent in that it will not
	  queue up more than 1 request for the same module to be reloaded,
	  and if a general reload request comes in ('module reload') the
	  queue is flushed and we only issue a single deferred reload for
	  the entire system. As for how this will impact existing
	  installations - Before 13778, a reload issued before module
	  initialization was completed would result in a deadlock. After
	  13778, you simply couldn't connect to the manager during startup
	  (which causes problems with #exec-that-calls-AMI configuration
	  files). I believe this is a good general purpose solution that
	  won't negatively impact existing installations. (closes issue

	* res/res_timing_pthread.c: Resolve issues with choppy sound when
	  using res_timing_pthread. The situation that caused this problem
	  was when continuous mode was being turned on and off while a rate
	  was set for a timing interface. A very easy way to replicate this
	  bug was to do a Playback() from behind a Local channel. In this
	  scenario, a rate gets set on the channel for doing file playback.
	  At the same time, continuous mode gets turned on and off about
	  every 20 ms as frames get queued on to the PBX side channel from
	  the other side of the Local channel. Essentially, this module
	  treated continuous mode and a set rate as mutually exclusive
	  states for the timer to be in. When I dug deep enough, I observed
	  the following pattern: 1) Set timer to tick every 20 ms. 2) Wait
	  almost 20 ms ... 3) Continuous mode gets turned on for a queued
	  up frame 4) Continuous mode gets turned off 5) The timer goes
	  back to its tick per 20 ms. state but starts counting at 0 ms. 6)
	  Goto step 2. Sometimes, res_timing_pthread would make it 20 ms
	  and produce a timer tick, but not most of the time. This is what
	  produced the choppy sound (or sometimes no sound at all). Now,
	  the module treats continuous mode and a set rate as completely
	  independent timer modes. They can be enabled and disabled
	  independently of each other and things work as expected. (closes

2009-05-28 20:36 +0000 [r197775]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* main/utils.c: Ensure that accidental calls to
	  ast_string_field_free_memory() on embedded stringfield pools are
	  safe. It is possible for a stringfield manager structure (and
	  pool) structure to be allocated as part of a larger structure
	  allocation (using ast_calloc_with_strinfields()); when this is
	  done, the stringfield pool cannot be separately freed, but users
	  of the tructure may not be aware (and shouldn't have to be aware)
	  of whether the pool was embedded. This patch modifies the
	  behavior so that they can always call
	  ast_string_field_free_memory() and the function will do the right
	  thing for both embedded and non-embedded situations.

	  source when responding to a reinvite with 491. When we receive a
	  SIP reinvite, it is possible that we may not be able to process
	  the reinvite immediately since we have also sent a reinvite out
	  ourselves. The problem is that whoever sent us the reinvite may
	  have also sent a reinvite out to another party, and that reinvite
	  may have succeeded. As a result, even though we are not going to
	  accept the reinvite we just received, it is important for us to
	  not have problems if we suddenly start receiving RTP from a new
	  source. The fix for this is to grab the media source information
	  from the SDP of the reinvite that we receive. This information is
	  passed to the RTP layer so that it will know about the alternate
	  source for media. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/252

	* cdr/cdr_custom.c: Fix errors in cdr_custom that cause reference

	  creating a ast_channel struct directly and passing it into the

	  string contained only calls to the CDR() function. Doing
	  something like ${EPOCH} on the other hand tried to lock the
	  channel, which would fail and throw an error because the passed
	  channel hadn't been allocated as an ao2 object. So now we create
	  the dummy channel with ast_channel_alloc, and everything works as
	  expected.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: SIP set outbound
	  transport type from Registration In sip.conf the transport option
	  allows for the configuration of what transport types (udp, tcp,
	  and tls) a peer will accept, but only the first type listed was
	  used for outbound connections. This patch changes this. Now the
	  default transport type is only used until the peer registers.
	  When registration takes place the transport type is parsed out of
	  the Contact header. If the Contact header's transport type is
	  equal to one that the peer supports, the peer's default transport
	  type for outbound connections is set to match the Contact
	  header's type. If the Contact header's transport type is not
	  present, then the peer's default transport type is set to match
	  the one the peer registered with. When a peer unregisters or the
	  registration expires, the default transport type for that peer is
	  reset. (closes issue #12282) Reported by: rjain Patches:

	  it looks like a huge positive number. This patch checks for this

	  respected. This patch also modifies the way ast_bridge_call()
	  chooses the cdr record to base the bridged_cdr on. Previously the
	  first unlocked cdr record would be chosen, now instead the first
	  cdr record is chosen and forked cdr records are moved to the
	  bridge_cdr. This allows the original cdr record and any forked
	  cdr records to be properly updated with answer and end times.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Add basic support
	  for handling connected line-related UPDATE requests. SIP purists
	  may want to look the other way... When COLP/CONP support for SIP
	  was committed, there was a condition under which Asterisk may
	  transmit a SIP UPDATE in order to communicate the change in
	  connected line information. The issue here is that while we could
	  send a SIP UPDATE message, we were not prepared to receive such
	  an UPDATE and would always responde with a 501 when we received
	  an UPDATE. The situation was a bit rough. We really want to be
	  able to receive UPDATEs having to do with connected line changes,
	  but the amount of effort involved in properly supporting RFC 3311
	  was staggering. This commit represents a compromise. First, it
	  was decided that it is important to only send a SIP UPDATE to an
	  endpoint that is able to handle one. So, now we have added
	  parsing of the Allow header into SIP. We store the allowed
	  methods on SIP peers so that when we communicate with them, we
	  already will know what we can and cannot send to them. We will
	  parse the peer's allowed methods when he registers with us. If
	  the peer is not the type to register with us, but the qualify
	  option is enabled, then we will use the response to the OPTIONS
	  request we send the peer to determine the peer's allowed methods.
	  When the peer's registration expires, or when qualify deems the
	  peer to be unreachable, we clear the allowed methods from the
	  peer. For an actual call, we will copy the peer's allowed methods
	  to the sip_pvt representing the call leg. If we are communicating
	  with an endpoint which is not a peer, then we will just parse the
	  Allow header from the first message we receive during the call
	  and store the information in the sip_pvt. If, during
	  communication with a peer, we receive a 501 response, then we
	  will make sure to save the fact that we cannot use that method
	  when communicating with that peer. Now, with all that
	  infrastructure in place, the only actual place we use this
	  information currently is when attempting to send a connected line
	  change using an UPDATE request. If we cannot send the change
	  immediately using an UPDATE, we will set the SIP_NEEDREINVITE
	  flag so that we can send a REINVITE as soon as it is allowed. The
	  second part of the changes here is for Asterisk to accept UPDATE
	  requests that have connected line changes. Since we are not fully
	  supporting RFC 3311, Asterisk will NOT place the UPDATE method in
	  Allow headers it sends. Instead, if you are communicating with
	  what you know to be another Asterisk box, you may set the
	  rpid_update parameter in sip.conf so that we will send UPDATEs to
	  that Asterisk box. When we send a connected line update, we set a
	  custom header called "X-Asterisk-rpid-update." On the receiving
	  end, if Asterisk receives an UPDATE that does not have the
	  "X-Asterisk-rpid-update" header present, then Asterisk will
	  respond with a 501 since media-changing UPDATEs are not
	  supported. We should never get such UPDATEs, since as was stated
	  earlier, Asterisk does not put UPDATE in its Allow header. If the
	  custom header is present in the received UPDATE, though, then we
	  will check the incoming request for connected line updates and
	  queue the update on the channel where the change occurred.

	  trigger a 482 response. The loop detection/spiral detection code
	  in chan_sip used the owner channel's state as a criterion for
	  determining if the incoming INVITE is a looped request. The
	  problem with this is that the INVITE-handling code happens in a
	  different thread than the thread that marks the owner channel as
	  being up. As a result, if a reinvite were to come in very
	  quickly, say from another Asterisk on the same LAN, it was
	  possible for the reinvite to arrive before the owner channel had
	  been set to the up state. This patch corrects the problem by
	  using the invitestate of the sip_pvt instead, since that can be
	  guaranteed to be set correctly by the time the reinvite arrives.
	  Since there is a switch statement further in the INVITE-handling
	  code, the AST_STATE_RINGING state also checks the invitestate of
	  the sip_pvt in case we should actually be treating the channel as
	  if it were up already. (closes issue #12215) Reported by: jpyle

	* main/pbx.c, main/logger.c: Two fixes found while debugging with
	  ast_backtrace(): 1) If MALLOC_DEBUG is used when concurrently
	  using ast_backtrace, the free() used in that routine will trigger
	  an error, because the memory was allocated internally to libc,
	  where we could not intercept that call to wrap it. Therefore,
	  it's not memory we knew about, and the free is reported as an
	  error. 2) Now that channels are objects, the old hack of
	  initializing a channel to all zeroes no longer works, since we
	  may try to call something like ast_channel_lock() within a
	  function on that reference. In that case, it's reported as an
	  error, because the pointer isn't an object reference.

	* main/manager.c: Fix a crash when logging out from the AMI and
	  avoid astobj2 warning messages. When the user logout the session
	  was being destroyed twice and the file descriptor was being
	  closed twice. The sessions reference counter wasn't used in a
	  proper way. The 'mansession' structure was being treated as an
	  astobj2 and we were calling ao2_lock/ao2_unlock causing astobj2
	  report a warning message and not locking the structure. Also we
	  were using an ugly naming convention 'destroy_session',
	  'session_destroy', 'free_session', ... all this "duplicated" code
	  was merged. (closes issue #14974) Reported by: pj Patches:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Update spiral support in trunk and 1.6.X to
	  match what is in 1.4. In 1.4, a SIP spiral is treated the same
	  way as a call forward. This works much better than what is
	  currently in trunk and 1.6.X. The code in trunk and 1.6.X did not
	  create a new call to the recipient of the spiral, instead trying
	  to continue the same call. In addition to just being plain wrong,
	  this also had the side effect of only being able to spiral calls
	  to other SIP channels. With this in place, as long as call
	  forwards are honored, SIP spirals will work properly. This means
	  that it will work for outbound calls made by the Queue, Dial, and
	  Page applications. For originated calls and spool calls, however,
	  the spiral will not work properly until a generic call forward
	  mechanism is introduced into Asterisk. (relates to issue #13630)

	  | 18 lines Move 300 bytes around on the stack, to make more room
	  for an extension buffer. This allows more concurrent extensions
	  to be copied for a single voicemail, without creating a
	  possibility of upsetting existing users, where a dialplan could
	  run out of stack space where it had run fine before.
	  Alternatively, we could have allocated off the heap, but that is
	  a larger change and would have increased the chance for
	  instability introduced by this change. This is really solved
	  starting in 1.6.0.11, as the use of an ast_str buffer allows an
	  unlimited number of extensions (up to available memory). We
	  additionally create a new warning message when the buffer length
	  is exceeded, permitting administrators to see an issue after the
	  fact, whereas previously the list was silently truncated. (closes

	* channels/chan_sip.c: TCP not matching valid peer. find_peer()

	  using the sockaddr_in argument. If the peer is not found after
	  using pvt->recv (works for UDP since the port number will be

	  change should fix both of these situations, but with the possible

	  (but a longer extension COULD have matched), it would have
	  previously gone immediately to the "i" extension, but will now

	  Correct some flaws in the memory accounting code for stringfields
	  and ao2 objects Under some conditions, the memory allocation for
	  stringfields and ao2 objects would not have supplied valid

	  allocated for channels and datastores As in previous commits,
	  when channels are allocated (with ast_channel_alloc) or
	  datastores are allocated (with ast_datastore_alloc) properly
	  account for the memory being owned by the caller, instead of the
	  allocator function itself.

	* main/utils.c, include/asterisk/stringfields.h: Ensure that string
	  pools allocated to hold stringfields are properly accounted in
	  MALLOC_DEBUG mode This commit modifies the stringfield pool
	  allocator to remember the 'owner' of the stringfield manager the
	  pool is being allocated for, and ensures that pools allocated in
	  the future when fields are populated are owned by that
	  file/function.

	  files ast_tls_read_conf() is a new api call for handling SSL/TLS
	  options across all conf files. Before this change, SSL/TLS
	  options were not consistent. http.conf and manager.conf required
	  the 'ssl' prefix while sip.conf used options with the 'tls'
	  prefix. While the options had different names in different conf
	  files, they all did the exact same thing. Now, instead of mixing
	  'ssl' or 'tls' prefixes to do the same thing depending on what
	  conf file you're in, all SSL/TLS options use the 'tls' prefix.
	  For example. 'sslenable' in http.conf and manager.conf is now
	  'tlsenable' which matches what already existed in sip.conf. Since
	  this has the potential to break backwards compatibility, previous
	  options containing the 'ssl' prefix still work, but they are no
	  longer documented in the sample.conf files. The change is noted
	  in the CHANGES file though. Review:

	  Before this, the certificate file was used for both the public
	  and private key. It is possible for this file to hold both, but
	  most configurations allow for a separate private key file to be
	  specified. Clarified in .conf files how these options are to be
	  used. The current conf files do not explain how the private key
	  is handled at all, so without knowledge of Asterisk's TLS
	  implementation, it would be hard to know for sure what was going
	  on or how to set it up. Review:

	  Convert the ast_channel data structure over to the astobj2
	  framework. There is a lot that could be said about this, but the
	  patch is a big improvement for performance, stability, code
	  maintainability, and ease of future code development. The channel
	  list is no longer an unsorted linked list. The main container for
	  channels is an astobj2 hash table. All of the code related to
	  searching for channels or iterating active channels has been
	  rewritten. Let n be the number of active channels. Iterating the
	  channel list has gone from O(n^2) to O(n). Searching for a
	  channel by name went from O(n) to O(1). Searching for a channel
	  by extension is still O(n), but uses a new method for doing so,
	  which is more efficient. The ast_channel object is now a
	  reference counted object. The benefits here are plentiful. Some
	  benefits directly related to issues in the previous code include:
	  1) When threads other than the channel thread owning a channel
	  wanted access to a channel, it had to hold the lock on it to
	  ensure that it didn't go away. This is no longer a requirement.
	  Holding a reference is sufficient. 2) There are places that now
	  require less dealing with channel locks. 3) There are places
	  where channel locks are held for much shorter periods of time. 4)
	  There are places where dealing with more than one channel at a
	  time becomes _MUCH_ easier. ChanSpy is a great example of this.
	  Writing code in the future that deals with multiple channels will
	  be much easier. Some additional information regarding channel
	  locking and reference count handling can be found in channel.h,
	  where a new section has been added that discusses some of the
	  rules associated with it. Mark Michelson also assisted with the
	  development of this patch. He did the conversion of ChanSpy and
	  introduced a new API, ast_autochan, which makes it much easier to
	  deal with holding on to a channel pointer for an extended period
	  of time and having it get automatically updated if the channel
	  gets masqueraded. Mark was also a huge help in the code review
	  process. Thanks to David Vossel for his assistance with this
	  branch, as well. David did the conversion of the DAHDIScan
	  application by making it become a wrapper for ChanSpy internally.
	  The changes come from the
	  svn/asterisk/team/russell/ast_channel_ao2 branch. Review:

	  created or set using an existing one, it isn't because the old

	* main/pbx.c: Several fixes to the extenpatternmatchnew logic. 1.
	  Differentiate between literal characters in an extension and
	  characters that should be treated as a pattern match. Prior to
	  these fixes, an extension such as NNN would be treated as a
	  pattern, rather than a literal string of N's. 2. Fixed the logic
	  used when matching an extension with a bracketed expression, such
	  as 2[5-7]6. 3. Removed all areas of code that were executed when
	  NOT_NOW was #defined. The code in these areas had the potential
	  to crash, for one thing, and the actual intent of these blocks
	  seemed counterproductive. 4. Fixed many many coding guidelines
	  problems I encountered while looking through the corresponding
	  code. 5. Added failure cases and warning messages for when
	  duplicate extensions are encountered. 6. Miscellaneous fixes to
	  incorrect or redundant statements. (closes issue #14615) Reported

	* channels/chan_sip.c: SIP state notify reorganization What I've
	  done here is simply break up how a state NOTIFY is built.
	  Originally both the XML and sip header information were built
	  within the same function. While this does work, it does not allow
	  for the creation of multipart/related message bodies that can
	  contain multiple XML entries with only one sip header. Now a
	  separate function builds the XML for each notify. This patch also
	  makes maintaining and modifying state notifications in the future
	  much less of a pain. Review: http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/224/

	  to libpri r732. Service messages are now supported for switch
	  types 4ess/5ess. A new option service_message_support has been
	  added to chan_dahdi.conf and is noted in the sample config file.
	  The service message support is turned off by default. The current
	  implementation relies on AstDB to keep track of channel state,
	  which allows the statuses to be preserved across Asterisk
	  restarts. Below is a description of the storage format. The state
	  and reason for the service state are in the form
	  <state>:<reason>, where: <state> ::= { 'O' } // 'O' – Out Of
	  Service <reason> ::= { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' }, where: '0' – No
	  reason (backwards compatibility) '1' – NEAR END '2' – FAR END '3'
	  – both NEAR and FAR END The new CLI commands to handle channel
	  service state are: pri service disable channel <chan> pri service
	  enable channel <chan> Many people contributed to the development
	  of this functionality. Because I entered at the very end I do not
	  know the exact history. Special thanks to all who moved the bug

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Fix a crash in res_musiconhold when using
	  cached realtime moh. The moh_register function links an mohclass
	  and then immediately unrefs the class since the container now has
	  a reference. The problem with using realtime music on hold is
	  that the class is allocated, registered, and started in one fell
	  swoop. The refcounting logic resulted in the count being off by
	  one. The same problem did not happen when using a static config
	  because the allocation and registration of an mohclass is a
	  separate operation from starting moh. This also did not affect
	  non-cached realtime moh because the classes are not registered at
	  all. I also have modified res_musiconhold to use the _t_ variants
	  of the ao2_ functions so that more info can be gleaned when
	  attempting to trace the refcounts. I found this to be incredibly
	  helpful for debugging this issue and there's no good reason to

	* main/channel.c, main/features.c, include/asterisk/channel.h: Add
	  timer for features so that backup bridge config can go away The
	  biggest change done here was elimination of the backup_config for
	  use with features. Previously, the bridging code upon detecting a
	  feature would set the start time of the bridge to the start time
	  of the feature. Then after the feature had either expired or
	  timed out the start time would be reset to the true bridge start
	  time from the backup_config. Now, the time differences are
	  calculated with respect to the newly added feature_start_time
	  timeval instead. There should be no behavior changes from the
	  previous functionality aside from the bridge timing being
	  unaffected by either valid or partial feature matches. Previously
	  the timing would be increased by the length of time configured
	  for featuredigittimeout, which was probably never noticed.

	  2009) | 24 lines Make a couple of changes with regards to a new
	  message printed in ast_read(). "ast_read() called with no
	  recorded file descriptor" is a new message added after a bug was
	  discovered. Unfortunately, it seems there are a bunch of places
	  that potentially make such calls to ast_read() and trigger this
	  error message to be displayed. This commit does two things to
	  help to make this message appear less. First, the message has
	  been downgraded to a debug level message if dev mode is not
	  enabled. The message means a lot more to developers than it does
	  to end users, and so developers should take an effort to be sure
	  to call ast_read only when a channel is ready to be read from.
	  However, since this doesn't actually cause an error in operation
	  and is not something a user can easily fix, we should not spam
	  their console with these messages. Second, the message has been
	  moved to after the check for any pending masquerades. ast_read()
	  being called with no recorded file descriptor should not
	  interfere with a masquerade taking place. This could be seen as a
	  simple way of resolving issue #14723. However, I still want to
	  try to clear out the existing ways of triggering this message,
	  since I feel that would be a better resolution for the issue.

	  corruption, I have removed it. There was also a TODO comment left
	  describing a potential implementation of an improvement to the
	  needdestroy handling. I'm not convinced that what was described
	  is the best choice here, so I have briefly described the way that
	  this function is used today that could be improved.

	  | 21 lines Fix a memory leak in cdr_radius. I came across this
	  while doing some testing of my ast_channel_ao2 branch. After
	  running a test overnight that generated over 5 million calls,
	  Asterisk had taken up about 1 GB of my system memory. So, I
	  re-ran the test with MALLOC_DEBUG turned on. However, it showed
	  no leaks in Asterisk during the test, even though Asterisk was
	  still consuming it somehow. Instead, I turned to valgrind, which
	  when run with --leak-check=full, told me exactly where the leak
	  came from, which was from allocations inside the radiusclient-ng
	  library. This explains why MALLOC_DEBUG did not report it. After
	  a bit of analysis, I found that we were leaking a little bit of
	  memory every time a CDR record was passed to cdr_radius. I don't
	  actually have a radius server set up to receive CDR records.
	  However, I always have my development systems compile and install
	  all modules. In addition to making sure there are not build
	  errors across modules, always loading modules helps find bugs
	  like this, too, so it is strongly recommend for all developers.

	  | 10 lines Fixes issue with dropped calles due to re-Invite glare
	  and re-Invites never executing after a 491 Acknowledgement for
	  491 responses were never being processed because it didn't match
	  our pending invite's seqno. Since the ACK was never processed,
	  the 491 frame would continue to be retransmitted until eventually
	  the call was dropped due to max retries. Now during a pending
	  invite, if we receive another invite, we send an 491 and hold on
	  to that glare invite's seqno in the "glareinvite" variable for
	  that sip_pvt struct. When ACK's are received, we first check to
	  see if it is in response to our pending invite, if not we check
	  to see if it is in response to a glare invite. In this case, it
	  is in response to the glare invite and must be dealt with or the
	  call is dropped. I've changed the wait time for resending the
	  re-Invite after receving a 491 response to comply with RFC 3261.
	  Before this patch the scheduled re-Invite would only change a
	  flag indicating that the re-Invite should be sent out, now it
	  actually sends it out as well. (closes issue #12013) Reported by:

	* main/utils.c, include/asterisk/stringfields.h: Optimizations to
	  the stringfields API This patch provides a number of
	  optimizations to the stringfields API, focused around saving (not
	  wasting) memory whenever possible. Thanks to Mark Michelson for
	  inspiring this work and coming up with the first two
	  optimizations that are represented here: Changes: - Cleanup of
	  some code, fix incorrect doxygen comments - When a field is
	  emptied or replaced with a new allocation, decrease the amount of
	  'active' space in the pool it was held in; if that pool reaches
	  zero active space, and is not the current pool, then free it as
	  it is no longer in use - When allocating a pool, try to allocate
	  a size that will fit in a 'standard' malloc() allocation without
	  wasting space - When allocating space for a field, store the
	  amount of space in the two bytes immediately preceding the field;
	  this eliminates the need to call strlen() on the field when
	  overwriting it, and more importantly it 'remembers' the amount of
	  space the field has available, even if a shorter string has been
	  stored in it since it was allocated - Don't automatically double
	  the size of each successive pool allocated; it's wasteful

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Improve performance of the code handling
	  the frame queue in chan_iax2. In my tests that exercised full
	  frame handling in chan_iax2, the version with these changes took
	  30% to 40% of the CPU time compared to the same test of Asterisk
	  trunk before these modifications. While doing some profiling for
	  <http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/205/>, one function that caught
	  my eye was network_thread() in chan_iax2.c. After the things that
	  I was working on there, it was the next target for analysis and
	  optimization. I used oprofile's source annotation functionality
	  and found that the loop traversing the frame queue in
	  network_thread() was to blame for the excessive CPU cycle
	  consumption. The frame_queue in chan_iax2 previously held all
	  frames that either were pending transmission or had been
	  transmitted and are still pending acknowledgment. In
	  network_thread(), the previous code would go back through the
	  main for loop after reading a single incoming frame or after
	  being signaled because a frame had been queued up for initial
	  transmission. In each iteration of the loop, it traverses the
	  entire frame queue looking for frames that need to be
	  transmitted. On a busy server, this could easily be quite a few
	  entries. This patch is actually quite simple. The frame_queue has
	  become only a list of frames pending acknowledgment. Frames that
	  need to be transmitted are queued up to a dedicated transmit
	  thread via the taskprocessor API. As a result, the code in
	  network_thread() becomes much simpler, as its only job is to read
	  incoming frames. In addition to the previously described changes,
	  this patch includes some additional changes to the frame_queue.
	  Instead of one big frame_queue, now there is a list per call
	  number to further reduce wasted list traversals. The biggest
	  impact of this change is in socket_process(). For additional
	  details on testing and test results, see the review request.

	  Mar 2009) | 35 lines Fix incorrect parsing in chan_gtalk when
	  xmpp contains extra whitespaces To drill into the xmpp to find
	  the capabilities between channels, chan_gtalk calls iks_child()
	  and iks_next(). iks_child() and iks_next() are functions in the
	  iksemel xml parsing library that traverse xml nodes. The bug here
	  is that both iks_child() and iks_next() will return the next
	  iks_struct node *regardless* of type. chan_gtalk expects the next
	  node to be of type IKS_TAG, which in most cases, it is, but in
	  this case (a call being made from the Empathy IM client), there
	  exists iks_struct nodes which are not IKS_TAG data (they are
	  extraneous whitespaces), and chan_gtalk doesn't handle that case,
	  so capabilities don't match, and a call cannot be made.
	  iks_first_tag() and iks_next_tag(), on the other hand, will not
	  return the very next iks_struct, but will check to see if the
	  next iks_struct is of type IKS_TAG. If it isn't, it will be
	  skipped, and the next struct of type IKS_TAG it finds will be
	  returned. This assures that chan_gtalk will find the iks_struct
	  it is looking for. This fix simply changes all calls to
	  iks_child() and iks_next() to become calls to iks_first_tag() and
	  iks_next_tag(), which resolves the capability matching. The
	  following is a payload listing from Empathy, which, due to the
	  extraneous whitespace, will not be parsed correctly by iksemel:

	  2009) | 39 lines Fix queue weight behavior so that calls in
	  low-weight queues are not inappropriately blocked. (This is
	  copied and pasted from the review request I made for this patch)
	  Asterisk has some odd behavior when queue weights are used. The
	  current logic used when potentially calling a queue member is: If
	  the member we are going to call is part of another queue and
	  _that other queue has any callers in it_ and has a higher weight
	  than the queue we are calling from, then don't try to contact
	  that member. The issue here is what I have marked with
	  underscores. If the higher-weighted queue has any callers in it
	  at all, then the queue member will be unreachable from the
	  lower-weighted queue. This has the potential to be really really
	  bad if using a queue strategy, such as leastrecent or
	  fewestcalls, with the potential to call the same member
	  repeatedly. The fix proposed by garychen on issue 13220 is very
	  simple and, as far as I can see, works well for this situation.
	  With this set of changes, the logic used becomes: If the member
	  we are going to call is part of another queue, the other queue
	  has a higher weight than the queue we are calling from, and the
	  higher weight queue has at least as many callers as available
	  members, then do not try to contact the queue member. If the
	  higher weighted queue has fewer callers than available members,
	  then there is no reason to deny the call to this member since the
	  other queue can afford to spare a member. Since the fix involved
	  writing a generic function for determining the number of
	  available members in the queue, I also modified the is_our_turn
	  function to make use of the new num_available_members function to
	  determine if it is our turn to try calling a member. There is one
	  small behavior change. Before writing this patch, if you had
	  autofill disabled, then if you were the head caller in a queue,
	  you would automatically be told that it was your turn to try
	  calling a member. This did not take into account whether there
	  were actually any queue members available to take the call. Now
	  we actually make sure there is at least one member available to
	  take the call if autofill is disabled. (closes issue #13220)

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix some issues with rwlock corruption
	  that caused deadlock like symptoms. When dvossel and I were doing
	  some load testing last week, we noticed that we could make
	  Asterisk trunk lock up instantly when we started generating a
	  bunch of calls. The backtraces of locked threads were bizarre,
	  and many were stuck on an _unlock_ of an rwlock. The changes are:
	  1) Fix a number of places where a backtrace would be loaded into
	  an invalid index of the backtrace array. It's an off by one
	  error, which ends up writing over the rwlock itself. 2) Ensure
	  that in the array of held locks, we NULL out an index once it is
	  not being used so that it's not confusing when analyzing its
	  contents. 3) Remove a bunch of logging referring to an rwlock
	  operating being done with "deep reentrancy". It is normal for
	  _many_ threads to hold a read lock on an rwlock.

	* main/file.c: Don't act surprised if we get a -1 indication.

	* main/heap.c, include/asterisk/heap.h: Pass more useful
	  information through to lock tracking when DEBUG_THREADS is on.

	  Improve performance of the ast_event cache functionality. This
	  code comes from svn/asterisk/team/russell/event_performance/.
	  Here is a summary of the changes that have been made, in order of
	  both invasiveness and performance impact, from smallest to
	  largest. 1) Asterisk 1.6.1 introduces some additional logic to be
	  able to handle distributed device state. This functionality comes
	  at a cost. One relatively minor change in this patch is that the
	  extra processing required for distributed device state is now
	  completely bypassed if it's not needed. 2) One of the things that
	  I noticed when profiling this code was that a _lot_ of time was
	  spent doing string comparisons. I changed the way strings are
	  represented in an event to include a hash value at the front. So,
	  before doing a string comparison, we do an integer comparison on
	  the hash. 3) Finally, the code that handles the event cache has
	  been re-written. I tried to do this in a such a way that it had
	  minimal impact on the API. I did have to change one API call,
	  though - ast_event_queue_and_cache(). However, the way it works
	  now is nicer, IMO. Each type of event that can be cached (MWI,
	  device state) has its own hash table and rules for hashing and
	  comparing objects. This by far made the biggest impact on
	  performance. For additional details regarding this code and how
	  it was tested, please see the review request. (closes issue

	  poll() not working properly on Mac OSX. If you search around,
	  you'll find a number of references to using select() instead of
	  poll() to work around these issues. In Asterisk, we've had poll.c
	  which implements poll() using select() internally. However, we
	  were still getting reports of problems. vadim investigated a bit
	  and realized that at least on his system, even though we were
	  compiling in poll.o, the system poll() was still being used. So,
	  the primary purpose of this patch is to ensure that we're using
	  the internal poll() when we want it to be used. The changes are:
	  1) Remove logic for when internal poll should be used from the
	  Makefile. Instead, put it in the configure script. The logic in
	  the configure script is the same as it was in the Makefile.
	  Ideally, we would have a functionality test for the problem, but
	  that's not actually possible, since we would have to be able to
	  run an application on the _target_ system to test poll()
	  behavior. 2) Always include poll.o in the build, but it will be
	  empty if AST_POLL_COMPAT is not defined. 3) Change uses of poll()
	  throughout the source tree to ast_poll(). I feel that it is good
	  practice to give the API call a new name when we are changing its
	  behavior and not using the system version directly in all cases.
	  So, normally, ast_poll() is just redefined to poll(). On systems
	  where AST_POLL_COMPAT is defined, ast_poll() is redefined to
	  ast_internal_poll(). 4) Change poll() in main/poll.c to be
	  ast_internal_poll(). It's worth noting that any code that still
	  uses poll() directly will work fine (if they worked fine before).
	  So, for example, out of tree modules that are using poll() will
	  not stop working or anything. However, for modules to work
	  properly on Mac OSX, ast_poll() needs to be used. (closes issue

	  updated under 1.6.3 rather than 1.6.2.

	* apps/app_dial.c, CHANGES: Option to send DTMF when receiving
	  PROGRESS status The D() option in app_dial is only able to send
	  DTMF after the call has been answered. A progress option has been
	  added to D() to allow DTMF to be sent upon receiving PROGRESS.
	  This allows DTMF to be sent before the call is answered. (closes

	* main/channel.c: correct logic flaw in ast_answer() changes in
	  r182525

	* main/channel.c, main/features.c, include/asterisk/channel.h:
	  Improve behavior of ast_answer() to not lose incoming frames
	  ast_answer(), when supplied a delay before returning to the
	  caller, use ast_safe_sleep() to implement the delay.
	  Unfortunately during this time any incoming frames are discarded,
	  which is problematic for T.38 re-INVITES and other sorts of
	  channel operations. When a delay is not passed to ast_answer(),
	  it still delays for up to 500 milliseconds, waiting for media to
	  arrive. Again, though, it discards any control frames, or
	  non-voice media frames. This patch rectifies this situation, by
	  storing all incoming frames during the delay period on a list,
	  and then requeuing them onto the channel before returning to the
	  caller. http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/196/
