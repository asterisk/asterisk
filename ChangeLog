	* AST-2014-012: Fix error with mixed address family ACLs.

	  Prior to this commit, the address family of the first item in an ACL
	  was used to compare all incoming traffic. This could lead to traffic
	  of other IP address families bypassing ACLs.

	* AST-2014-013: Fix PJSIP ACLs not loading on startup and apply/ACL
	  issues on contact

	  The biggest problem this patch fixes is that ACLs weren't previously
	  being loaded when the res_pjsip_acl module was loaded. In addition,
	  the ACL options contact_permit and contact_acl were effectively
	  interpreted as contact_deny and this patch fixes that as well.

	* AST-2014-018 - func_db: DB Dialplan function permission escalation
	  via AMI.

	  The DB dialplan function when executed from an external protocol
	  (for instance AMI), could result in a privilege escalation.

	  Asterisk now inhibits the DB function from being executed from an
	  external interface if the live_dangerously option is set to no.

	  res/res_pjsip/config_system.c, UPGRADE.txt: res_pjsip: Add
	  disable_tcp_switch option. When a packet exceeds the MTU,
	  pjproject will switch from UDP to TCP. In some circumstances (on
	  some networks), this can cause some issues with messages not
	  getting sent to the correct destination - and can also cause
	  connections to get dropped due to quirks in pjproject deciding to
	  terminate TCP connections with no messages. While fixing the
	  routing/messaging issues is important, having a configuration
	  option in Asterisk that tells pjproject to not switch over to TCP
	  would be useful. That way, if some glitch is discovered on some
	  other network/site, we can at least disable the behavior until a
	  fix is put into place. AFS-197 #close Review:

	  AST-2014-011: Fix POODLE security issues There are two aspects to
	  the vulnerability: (1) res_jabber/res_xmpp use SSLv3 only. This
	  patch updates the module to use TLSv1+. At this time, it does not
	  refactor res_jabber/res_xmpp to use the TCP/TLS core, which
	  should be done as an improvement at a latter date. (2) The
	  TCP/TLS core, when tlsclientmethod/sslclientmethod is left
	  unspecified, will default to the OpenSSL SSLv23_method. This
	  method allows for all encryption methods, including SSLv2/SSLv3.
	  A MITM can exploit this by forcing a fallback to SSLv3, which
	  leaves the server vulnerable to POODLE. This patch adds WARNINGS
	  if a user uses SSLv2/SSLv3 in their configuration, and explicitly
	  disables SSLv2/SSLv3 if using SSLv23_method. For TLS clients,
	  Asterisk will default to TLSv1+ and WARN if SSLv2 or SSLv3 is
	  explicitly chosen. For TLS servers, Asterisk will no longer
	  support SSLv2 or SSLv3. Much thanks to abelbeck for reporting the
	  vulnerability and providing a patch for the res_jabber/res_xmpp

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Undo 425921 This
	  patch for r425921 introduced a different bug, wherein sending an
	  INVITE request with no SDP would cause Asterisk to not send an
	  SDP Offer in the 200 OK. The current structure of
	  res_pjsip_sdp_rtp is a bit hard to deal with to fix this,
	  particularly in 12: (1) The format capabilities structures and
	  how they are used are a bit harder to manipulate than they are in
	  13 (2) create_outgoing_sdp has no knowledge of whether or not it
	  is creating an SDP as a new Offer or an Answer. This is something
	  of an oversight in the callback definition, as the caller of it
	  does have this information.

	  when looking to decline outgoing media When constructing an

	  checks the override preferences (set by the PJSIP_MEDIA_OFFER
	  function) as well as what is configured on the endpoint to
	  determine if a codec is available for the media stream.
	  Unfortunately, this isn't good enough: we must also look at the
	  negotiated (joint) format capabilities. Otherwise, we'll
	  construct a media stream offer/answer with no codecs. Note that
	  this isn't an issue in 13, which already looks at the joint
	  capabilities thanks to the media re-work done there.

	  Asterisk currently makes a few incorrection assumptions: (1) If
	  the offer contains more than a single audio/video stream,
	  Asterisk will reject the entire stream with a 488. This is an
	  overly strict response; generally, Asterisk should accept the
	  media streams that it can accept and decline the others. (2) If
	  the offer contains a declined media stream, Asterisk will attempt
	  to process it anyway. This can result in attempting to match
	  format capabilities on a declined media stream, leading to a 488.
	  Asterisk should simply ignore declined media streams. (3)
	  Asterisk will currently attempt to handle offers with AVPF with

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: channels/chan_sip: Respect outboundproxy
	  setting when sending qualify requests The outboundproxy setting
	  is currently ignored when sending OPTIONS requests as a result of
	  the qualify setting. This means that if an Asterisk server is
	  unable to send the packet directly to a peer, it is unable to
	  qualify any non-inbound registered peer (e.g. a peer SIP Trunk).
	  This patch grabs the outboundproxy information for a peer when a
	  qualify attempt is being constructed and, if it finds the
	  information, uses it when sending the OPTIONS request. Review:

	* bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c: bridge_native_rtp: Fix audio issues
	  when moving from remote bridge to softmix When a native RTP
	  bridge that is remotely bridging its participants switches to a
	  softmix bridge, it may not properly re-INVITE the media for one
	  or both participants back to Asterisk. This is due to the current
	  bridge_native_rtp code only re-INVITEs if it believes the channel
	  will survive the bridge operation. Currently, that code is
	  failing, as it expects the channels to have a soft hangup flag
	  set on it indicating that a redirect has occurred or that the
	  channel is going to leave the bridge. (The code did not take into
	  account a smart bridge operation). This patch also renames a few
	  things to be more reflective of the underlying types. Review:

	* tests/test_cel.c: test_cel: Update pickup test to expect CANCEL

	  channels that are involved in a dial operation don't create the

	  into the caller channel. The case happens when performing a
	  blonde transfer using the channel driver's protocol. 2) A channel
	  masquerades into a callee channel. The case happens when
	  performing a directed call pickup. 3) The caller channel
	  masquerades out of dial. The case happens when using the Bridge
	  application on the caller channel. 4) A callee channel
	  masquerades out of dial. The case happens when using the Bridge
	  application on a peer channel. As it turned out, all four cases
	  need to be handled instead of just the first one. ASTERISK-24237

	  non-unique category names via AMI This patch provides the
	  capability to manipulate templates and categories with non-unique
	  names via AMI. Summary of changes: GetConfig and GetConfigJSON:
	  Added "Filter" parameter: A comma separated list of
	  name_regex=value_regex expressions which will cause only
	  categories whose variables match all expressions to be
	  considered. The special variable name TEMPLATES can be used to
	  control whether templates are included. Passing 'include' as the
	  value will include templates along with normal categories.
	  Passing 'restrict' as the value will restrict the operation to
	  ONLY templates. Not specifying a TEMPLATES expression results in
	  the current default behavior which is to not include templates.
	  UpdateConfig: NewCat now includes options for allowing duplicate
	  category names, indicating if the category should be created as a
	  template, and specifying templates the category should inherit
	  from. The rest of the actions now accept a filter string as
	  defined above. If there are non-unique category names, you can
	  now update specific ones based on variable values. To facilitate
	  the new capabilities in manager, corresponding changes had to be
	  made to config, most notably the addition of filter criteria to
	  many of the APIs. In some cases it was easy to change the
	  references to use the new prototype but others would have
	  required touching too many files for this patch so a wrapper with
	  the original prototype was created. Macros couldn't be used in
	  this case because it would break binary compatibility with
	  modules such as res_digium_phone that are linked to real symbols.

	  res_phoneprov: Refactor phoneprov to allow pluggable config
	  providers This patch makes res_phoneprov more modular so other
	  modules (like pjsip) can provide configuration information
	  instead of res_phoneprov relying solely on users.conf and
	  sip.conf. To accomplish this a new ast_phoneprov public API is
	  now exposed which allows config providers to register themselves,
	  set defaults (server profile, etc) and add user extensions. *
	  ast_phoneprov_provider_register registers the provider and
	  provides callbacks for loading default settings and loading
	  users. * ast_phoneprov_provider_unregister clears the defaults
	  and users. * ast_phoneprov_add_extension should be called once
	  for each user/extension by the provider's load_users callback to
	  add them. * ast_phoneprov_delete_extension deletes one extension.
	  * ast_phoneprov_delete_extensions deletes all extensions for the
	  provider. Tested-by: George Joseph Review:

	* main/app.c: Remove undocumented default behavior of
	  ast_play_and_record_full acceptdtmf. ast_play_and_record_full()
	  has a parameter called "acceptdtmf" that is a string of
	  acceptable DTMF digits that may be pressed by a caller to end and
	  accept the recording. ARI uses this function in order to perform
	  recording, and it provides options for what is passed as
	  acceptdtmf to ast_play_and_record_full(). By default, ARI passes
	  an empty string, with the intention that no DTMF can be used to
	  end the recording. The problem is that ast_play_and_record_full()
	  attempts to be "helpful" by setting "#" as the acceptdtmf if an
	  empty string or NULL pointer has been passed in. With ARI, this
	  results in unexpected behavior occurring if you have attempted to
	  intercept "#" yourself in order to perform some other
	  manipulation of the live recording. This change removes the
	  "helpful" behavior by no longer accepting "#" as a default
	  acceptdtmf if none is specified by the caller of
	  ast_play_and_record_full(). This makes the ARI scenario work as
	  expected. The other callers of ast_play_and_record_full() are
	  app_voicemail and app_minivm, and in both cases, they pass an
	  explicit "#" to ast_play_and_record_full() as acceptdtmf, so they
	  are unaffected by this change.

	* main/cdr.c: main/cdr: Copy over location information during a

	  a clone of the last non-finalized for the particular Party A. In
	  the past, merely copying over the snapshots for Party A/Party B

	* apps/app_stack.c, main/cdr.c, apps/app_macro.c,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h: main/cdrs: Preserve context/extension
	  when executing a Macro or GoSub The context/extension in a CDR is
	  generally considered the destination of a call. When looking at a
	  2-party call CDR, users will typically be presented with the
	  following: context exten channel dest_channel app data default
	  1000 SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 However, if the Dial
	  actually takes place in a Macro, the current behaviour in 12 will
	  result in the following CDR: context exten channel dest_channel
	  app data macro-dial s SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 The
	  same is true of a GoSub: context exten channel dest_channel app
	  data subs dial_stuff SIP/8675309 SIP/1000 Dial SIP/1000,,20 This
	  generally makes the context/exten fields less than useful. It
	  isn't hard to preserve these values in the CDR state machine;
	  however, we need to have something that informs us when a channel
	  is executing a subroutine. Prior to this patch, there isn't
	  anything that does this. This patch solves this problem by adding
	  a new channel flag, AST_FLAG_SUBROUTINE_EXEC. This flag is set on
	  a channel when it executes a Macro or a GoSub. The CDR engine

	* main/cdr.c: main/cdr: Fix crash/memory consumption in CDRs in
	  multi-party bridge scenarios This patch fixes an issue where CDRs
	  would get stuck generating an infinite number of CDRs, eventually
	  crashing Asterisk (and consuming a lot of memory along the way).
	  When a channel enters into a multi-party bridge, the CDR engine
	  creates mappings of each participant to each other participant,
	  picking the 'A' party as it goes. So, if we have four channels in
	  a multi-party bridge (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Denise), we would have
	  something like: Alice => Bob Alice => Charlie Alice => Denise Bob
	  => Charlie Bob => Denise Charlie => Denise This works fine when
	  participants enter the bridge a single time. When a participant
	  leaves a bridge, the CDRs for that channel are transitioned to a
	  finalized state. The bug occurs if Bob rejoins. When the CDR
	  engine creates mappings between the channels, it walks through
	  all the participants currently in the bridge, and realizes that
	  no one in the bridge can create a CDR with the channel (Bob). As
	  such it creates a new CDR for the candidate and appends it to
	  that candidate's chain. Unfortunately, on this particular code
	  path, it doesn't stop traversing the candidate's chain. Since we
	  just added ourselves to the chain, this causes the loop to keep
	  going, constantly adding new CDRs. This patch makes it so the
	  engine bails when it creates a CDR match in this case. Review:

	  Resolve race condition where channels enter dialplan application
	  before media has been negotiated. Testsuite tests will
	  occasionally fail because on reception of a 200 OK SIP response,
	  an AST_CONTROL_ANSWER frame is queued prior to when media has
	  finished being negotiated. This is because session supplements
	  are called into before PJSIP's inv_session code has told us that
	  media has been updated. Sometimes the queued answer frame is
	  handled by the PBX thread before the ensuing media negotiations
	  occur, causing a test failure. As it turns out, there is another
	  place that session supplements could be called into, which is
	  after media has finished getting negotiated. What this commit
	  introduces is a means for session supplements to indicate when
	  they wish to be called into when handling an incoming SIP
	  response. By default, all session supplements will be run at the
	  same point that they were prior to this commit. However, session
	  supplements may indicate that they wish to be handled earlier
	  than normal on redirects, or they may indicate they wish to be
	  handled after media has been negotiated. In this changeset, two
	  session supplements have been updated to indicate a preference
	  for when they should be run: res_pjsip_diversion executes before
	  handling redirection in order to get information from the
	  Diversion header, and chan_pjsip now handles responses to INVITEs
	  after media negotiation to fix the race condition mentioned

	* res/res_stasis.c, res/stasis/stasis_bridge.c: res_stasis: Don't
	  play MoH to channels by default when added to holding bridges
	  When ARI manipulates a bridge, it generally doesn't care what the
	  mixing technology is. Operations on a bridge initiated through
	  ARI should perform their action in generally the same way,
	  regardless of the bridge's mixing technology. While the mixing
	  technology may determine how media flows to channels, the actual
	  operations on a bridge themselves should be the same. Currently,
	  this isn't the case with holding bridges. When a channel joins
	  without a role, MoH is started on that channel automatically.
	  Subsequent bridge operations that would stop MoH would fail (as
	  there is no Announcer channel playing MoH to the bridge).
	  Starting MoH on the bridge will also create two MoH streams: one
	  from the MoH being played on the participant channel, and one
	  from the announcer channel. From the perspective of ARI users,
	  this is counter-intuitive - I would not expect MoH to be started
	  for me. The mixing technology determines how media is shared
	  between participants, not the application experience. This patch
	  does the following: * The Stasis bridge class now inspects
	  channels as they are going into a bridge. If the bridge has a
	  holding capability, and the channel has no roles, we give it a
	  participant role and mark the default behaviour to have no
	  entertainment. This allows addChannel operations to continue to
	  set a participant role with an entertainment option if it felt
	  like it (or could do it). * The music on hold channel is now

	  registrations. 1. With dnsmgr disabled, if the host is not
	  resolvable we are not trying to resolve the host again when it is
	  time to attempt to register again. This results in never
	  registering to the host. 2. With dnsmgr enabled, when the host is

	  then when the host is resolvable the port is not being restored
	  and stays set to 0. This patch resolves these two issues by: *
	  Storing the hostname so that it can be used for resolving with
	  DNS. * Resolve the hostname on the next scheduled attempt to
	  register. * Storing the port used to reach the host so that when
	  the hostname is resolvable again, we can set the port again if

	* main/pbx.c, /, pbx/pbx_lua.c: pbx_lua: fix regression with global
	  sym export and context clash by pbx_config. ASTERISK-23818 (lua
	  contexts being overwritten by contexts of the same name in
	  pbx_config) surfaced because pbx_lua, having the
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS set, was always force loaded before
	  pbx_config. Since I couldn't find any reason for pbx_lua to
	  export it's symbols to the rest of Asterisk, I simply changed the
	  flag to AST_MODFLAG_DEFAULT. Problem solved. What I didn't
	  realize was that the symbols need to be exported not because
	  Asterisk needs them but because any external Lua modules like
	  luasql.mysql need the base Lua language APIs exported
	  (ASTERISK-17279). Back to ASTERISK-23818... It looks like there's
	  an issue in pbx.c where context_merge was only merging includes,
	  switches and ignore patterns if the context was already existing
	  AND has extensions, or if the context was brand new. If pbx_lua
	  is loaded before pbx_config, the context will exist BUT pbx_lua,
	  being implemented as a switch, will never place extensions in it,
	  just the switch statement. The result is that when pbx_config
	  loads, it never merges the switch statement created by pbx_lua
	  into the final context. This patch sets pbx_lua's modflag back to
	  AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS and adds an "else if" in context_merge
	  that catches the case where an existing context has includes,
	  switchs or ingore patterns but no actual extensions.

	  channel technology agnostic out of call text messaging This patch
	  adds the ability to send and receive text messages from various
	  technology stacks in Asterisk through ARI. This includes chan_sip
	  (sip), res_pjsip_messaging (pjsip), and res_xmpp (xmpp). Messages
	  are sent using the endpoints resource, and can be sent directly
	  through that resource, or to a particular endpoint. For example,
	  the following would send the message "Hello there" to PJSIP
	  endpoint alice with a display URI of
	  sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org:
	  ari/endpoints/sendMessage?to=pjsip:alice&from=sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org&body=Hello+There
	  This is equivalent to the following as well:
	  ari/endpoints/PJSIP/alice/sendMessage?from=sip:asterisk@mycooldomain.org&body=Hello+There
	  Both forms are available for message technologies that allow for
	  arbitrary destinations, such as chan_sip. Inbound messages can
	  now be received over ARI as well. An ARI application that
	  subscribes to endpoints will receive messages from those
	  endpoints: { "type": "TextMessageReceived", "timestamp":
	  "2014-07-12T22:53:13.494-0500", "endpoint": { "technology":
	  "PJSIP", "resource": "alice", "state": "online", "channel_ids":
	  [] }, "message": { "from": "\"alice\" <sip:alice@127.0.0.1>",
	  "to": "pjsip:asterisk@127.0.0.1", "body": "Watson, come here.",
	  "variables": [] }, "application": "testsuite" } The above was
	  made possible due to some rather major changes in the message
	  core. This includes (but is not limited to): - Users of the
	  message API can now register message handlers. A handler has two
	  callbacks: one to determine if the handler has a destination for
	  the message, and another to handle it. - All dialplan
	  functionality of handling a message was moved into a message
	  handler provided by the message API. - Messages can now have the
	  technology/endpoint associated with them. Various other
	  properties are also now more easily accessible. - A number of ao2
	  containers that weren't really needed were replaced with vectors.
	  Iteration over ao2_containers is expensive and pointless when the
	  lifetime of things is well defined and the number of things is
	  very small. res_stasis now has a new file that makes up its
	  structure, messaging. The messaging functionality implements a
	  message handler, and passes received messages that match an
	  interested endpoint over to the app for processing. Note that
	  inadvertently while testing this, I reproduced ASTERISK-23969.
	  res_pjsip_messaging was incorrectly parsing out the 'to' field,
	  such that arbitrary SIP URIs mangled the endpoint lookup. This
	  patch includes the fix for that as well. Review:

	  (added), CHANGES, channels/chan_pjsip.c: res_hep_rtcp: Add module
	  that sends RTCP information to a Homer Server This patch adds a
	  new module to Asterisk, res_hep_rtcp. The module subscribes to
	  the RTCP topics in Stasis and receives RTCP information back from
	  the message bus. It encodes into HEPv3 packets and sends the
	  information to the res_hep module for transmission. Using this,
	  someone with a Homer server can get live call quality monitoring
	  for all RTP-based channels in their Asterisk 12+ systems. In
	  addition, there were a few bugs in the RTP engine,
	  res_rtp_asterisk, and chan_pjsip that were uncovered by the tests
	  written for the Asterisk Test Suite. This patch fixes the
	  following: 1) chan_pjsip failed to set its channel unique ids on
	  its RTP instance on outbound calls. It now does this in the
	  appropriate location, in the serialized call callback. 2) The
	  rtp_engine was overflowing some values when packed into JSON.
	  Specifically, some longs and unsigned ints can't be be packed
	  into integer values, for obvious reasons. Since libjansson only
	  supports integers, floats, strings, booleans, and objects, we
	  print these values into strings. 3) res_rtp_asterisk had a few
	  problems: (a) it would emit a source IP address of 0.0.0.0 if
	  bound to that IP address. We now use ast_find_ourip to get a
	  better IP address, and properly marshal the result into an
	  ast_strdupa'd string. (b) Reports can be generated with no report
	  bodies. In particular, this occurs when a sender is transmitting
	  information to a receiver (who will send no RTP back to the
	  sender). As such, the sender has no report body for what it
	  received. We now properly handle this case, and the sender will
	  emit SR reports with no body. Likewise, if we receive an RTCP
	  packet with no report body, we will still generate the
	  appropriate events. ASTERISK-24119 #close

	  endpoint/channel subscription issues; allow for subscriptions to
	  tech This patch serves two purposes: (1) It fixes some bugs with
	  endpoint subscriptions not reporting all of the channel events
	  (2) It serves as the preliminary work needed for ASTERISK-23692,
	  which allows for sending/receiving arbitrary out of call text
	  messages through ARI in a technology agnostic fashion. The
	  messaging functionality described on ASTERISK-23692 requires two
	  things: (1) The ability to send/receive messages associated with
	  an endpoint. This is relatively straight forwards with the
	  endpoint core in Asterisk now. (2) The ability to send/receive
	  messages associated with a technology and an arbitrary technology
	  defined URI. This is less straight forward, as endpoints are
	  formed from a tech + resource pair. We don't have a mechanism to
	  note that a technology that *may* have endpoints exists. This
	  patch provides such a mechanism, and fixes a few bugs along the
	  way. The first major bug this patch fixes is the forwarding of
	  channel messages to their respective endpoints. Prior to this
	  patch, there were two problems: (1) Channel caching messages
	  weren't forwarded. Thus, the endpoints missed most of the
	  interesting bits (such as channel creation, destruction, state
	  changes, etc.) (2) Channels weren't associated with their
	  endpoint until after creation. This resulted in endpoints missing
	  the channel creation message, which limited the usefulness of the
	  subscription in the first place (a major use case being 'tell me
	  when this endpoint has a channel'). Unfortunately, this meant
	  another parameter to ast_channel_alloc. Since not all channel
	  technologies support an ast_endpoint, this patch makes such a
	  call optional and opts for a new function,
	  ast_channel_alloc_with_endpoint. When endpoints are created, they
	  will implicitly create a technology endpoint for their technology
	  (if one does not already exist). A technology endpoint is special
	  in that it has no state, cannot have channels created for it,
	  cannot be created explicitly, and cannot be destroyed except on
	  shutdown. It does, however, have all messages from other
	  endpoints in its technology forwarded to it. Combined with the
	  bug fixes, we now have Stasis messages being properly forwarded.
	  Consider the following scenario: two PJSIP endpoints (foo and
	  bar), where bar has a single channel associated with it and foo
	  has two channels associated with it. The messages would be
	  forwarded as follows: channel PJSIP/foo-1 -- \ --> endpoint
	  PJSIP/foo -- / \ channel PJSIP/foo-2 -- \ ---- > endpoint PJSIP /
	  channel PJSIP/bar-1 -----> endpoint PJSIP/bar -- ARI, through the
	  applications resource, can: - subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP/foo and
	  get notifications for channels PJSIP/foo-1,PJSIP/foo-2 and
	  endpoint PJSIP/foo - subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP/bar and get
	  notifications for channels PJSIP/bar-1 and endpoint PJSIP/bar -
	  subscribe to endpoint:PJSIP and get notifications for channels
	  PJSIP/foo-1,PJSIP/foo-2,PJSIP/bar-1 and endpoints
	  PJSIP/foo,PJSIP/bar Note that since endpoint PJSIP never changes,
	  it never has events itself. It merely provides an aggregation
	  point for all other endpoints in its technology (which in turn
	  aggregate all channel messages associated with that endpoint).
	  This patch also adds endpoints to res_xmpp and chan_motif,
	  because the actual messaging work will need it (messaging without
	  XMPP is just sad). Review:

	  Local channel halves when originating to app This patch fixes two
	  bugs: 1. When originating a channel into a Stasis application, we
	  already create a subscription for the channel that is going into
	  our Stasis app. Unfortunately, when you create a Local channel
	  and pass it off to a Stasis app, you really aren't creating just
	  one channel: you're creating two. This patch snags the second
	  half of the Local channel pair (assuming it is a Local channel
	  pair, but luckily core_local is kind about such assumptions) and
	  subscribes to it as well. 2. Subscriptions are a bit sticky right
	  now. If a subscription is made, the 'interest' count gets bumped
	  on the Stasis subscription - but unless something explicitly
	  unsubscribes the channel, said subscription sticks around. This
	  is not much of a problem is a user is creating the subscription -
	  if they made it, they must want it. However, when we are creating
	  implicit subscriptions, we need to make sure something clears
	  them out. This patch takes a pessimistic approach: it watches the
	  cache updates coming from Stasis and, if we notice that the cache
	  just cleared out an object, we delete our subscription object.
	  This keeps our ao2 container of Stasis forwards in an application
	  from growing out of hand; it also is a bit more forgiving for end
	  users who may not realize they were supposed to unsubscribe from
	  that channel that just hung up. Review:

	  8 "Inband info now available" MAY be sent to the CPE if no digits

	  progress indicator when needed. NOTE: For Q.SIG setups this
	  option should be enabled when outgoing overlap dialing is also

	* main/event.c: event.c: Fix type mismatch errors in ie_maps[]. In
	  v12+ the type values from the table are only used by the CEL unit
	  tests. Since the unit tests were only comparing a generated
	  expected event with a real event to see if the ie contents
	  matched and using the same table IE_PLTYPE values to read the
	  event contents, the type mismatches were not detected.

	* /, main/astobj2.c: Ensure REF_DEBUG records entrys for attempts
	  to ao2_ref an invalid object This change ensures that
	  __ao2_ref_debug writes to ref_log when given a non-NULL pointer
	  to an invalid ao2 object. This is to ensure that we record any
	  attempt manipulate references of already freed objects.

	  Close websocket correctly and use careful fwrite When a client
	  takes a long time to process information received from Asterisk,
	  a write operation using fwrite may fail to write all information.
	  This causes the underlying file stream to be in an unknown state,
	  such that the socket must be disconnected. Unfortunately, there
	  are two problems with this in Asterisk's existing websocket code:
	  1. Periodically, during the read loop, Asterisk must write to the
	  connected websocket to respond to pings. As such, Asterisk
	  maintains a reference to the session during the loop. When
	  ast_http_websocket_write fails, it may cause the session to
	  decrement its ref count, but this in and of itself does not break
	  the read loop. The read loop's write, on the other hand, does not
	  break the loop if it fails. This causes the socket to get in a
	  'stuck' state, preventing the client from reconnecting to the
	  server. 2. More importantly, however, is that the fwrite in
	  ast_http_websocket_write fails with a large volume of data when
	  the client takes awhile to process the information. When it does
	  fail, it fails writing only a portion of the bytes. With some
	  debugging, it was shown that this was failing in a similar
	  fashion to ASTERISK-12767. Switching this over to
	  ast_careful_fwrite with a long enough timeout solved the problem.
	  Note that this version of the patch, unlike r417310 in Asterisk
	  11, exposes configuration options beyond just chan_sip's
	  sip.conf. Configuration options to configure the write timeout
	  have also been added to pjsip.conf and ari.conf. #ASTERISK-23917

	* /, configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in: build: Allow

	  ast_ext_tool_check.m4 isn't handling cases where a path to a
	  package is provided (E.G. --with-mysqlclient=/some/sysroot) and
	  the package has a config tool (E.G. mysql_config) and the package
	  has its own subdirectories in include or lib. For example,
	  mysql's libraries are in ${MYSQLCLIENT_DIR}/usr/lib/mysql but
	  ast_ext_tool_check sets MYSQLCLIENT_LIB to
	  ${MYSQLCLIENT_DIR}/usr/lib. libxml2 has the same problem with its
	  includes. They're in ${LIBXML2_DIR}/usr/include/libxml2 not
	  directly in ${LIBXML2_DIR}/usr/include. Both cause configure to
	  fail and there are others in the same boat. The problem is caused
	  by logic in ast_ext_tool_check that overrides the result of the
	  config tool's --cflags and --libs options if package_DIR is set.
	  This patch prepends package_DIR (if specified) to the -L and -I
	  results from the package's config tool instead of overriding
	  them. A regenerated ./configure and
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in are included but can be

	* main/stasis_channels.c: stasis_channels: Update the stasis cache
	  if manager variables are needed In r416211, the publishing of
	  variable changes was modified such that a cached channel snapshot
	  was used if manager variables were not requested with each AMI
	  event. This was done to reduce the amount of channel snapshots
	  created. However, an assumption was made that generating a
	  channel snapshot and publishing the snapshot to the channel topic
	  was sufficient to ensure that the cache would be updated; this is
	  not the case. The channel snapshot type must be used to force a
	  snapshot update. This patch updates the publication of channel
	  variables such that the cache is updated prior to publication of
	  the channel variable message if manager variables are in use.
	  This ensures that all AMI events receive the variable update when
	  they are supposed to. Note that this issue was caught by the
	  Asterisk Test Suite (go go testing)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: channels/chan_sip: Forbid remote bridging if

	  When this occurs, get_rtp_info will be called to determine if

	  were expensive to have on the snapshot, and hurt performance.
	  This included formats, translation paths, Log Call ID, callgroup,
	  pickup group, and all channel variables. As a result, AMI Status,
	  "core show channel", "core show channelvar", and "pjsip show
	  channel" were modified to either hit the live channel or not show
	  certain pieces of data. While this is unfortunate, the
	  performance gain from this patch is worth the loss in behaviour.
	  - It adds a mechanism to publish a cached snapshot + blob. A
	  large number of publications were changed to use this, including:
	  - During Dial begin - During Variable assignment (if no AMI
	  variables are emitted - if AMI variables are set, we have to make
	  snapshots when a variable is changed) - During channel pickup -
	  When a channel is put on hold/unhold - When a DTMF digit is
	  begun/ended - When creating a bridge snapshot - When an AOC event
	  is raised - During Local channel optimization/Local bridging -
	  When endpoint snapshots are generated - All AGI events - All ARI
	  responses that return a channel - Events in the AgentPool,
	  MeetMe, and some in Queue - Additionally, some extraneous channel
	  snapshots were being made that were unnecessary. These were
	  removed. - The result of ast_hashtab_hash_string is now cached in
	  stasis_cache. This reduces a large number of calls to
	  ast_hashtab_hash_string, which reduced the amount of time spent
	  in this function in gprof by around 50%. ASTERISK-23811 #close

	* /, res/res_musiconhold.c: MoH: Don't restart stream on repeated

	  number of allowed HTTP connections. Simply establishing a TCP
	  connection and never sending anything to the configured HTTP port
	  in http.conf will tie up a HTTP connection. Since there is a
	  maximum number of open HTTP sessions allowed at a time you can
	  block legitimate connections. A similar problem exists if a HTTP
	  request is started but never finished. * Added http.conf
	  session_inactivity timer option to close HTTP connections that
	  aren't doing anything. Defaults to 30000 ms. * Removed the
	  undocumented manager.conf block-sockets option. It interferes
	  with TCP/TLS inactivity timeouts. * AMI and SIP TLS connections
	  now have better authentication timeout protection. Though I
	  didn't remove the bizzare TLS timeout polling code from chan_sip.
	  * chan_sip can now handle SSL certificate renegotiations in the
	  middle of a session. It couldn't do that before because the
	  socket was non-blocking and the SSL calls were not restarted as
	  documented by the OpenSSL documentation. * Fixed an off nominal
	  leak of the ssl struct in handle_tcptls_connection() if the FILE
	  stream failed to open and the SSL certificate negotiations
	  failed. The patch creates a custom FILE stream handler to give
	  the created FILE streams inactivity timeout and timeout after a
	  specific moment in time capability. This approach eliminates the
	  need for code using the FILE stream to be redesigned to deal with
	  the timeouts. This patch indirectly fixes most of ASTERISK-18345
	  by fixing the usage of the SSL_read/SSL_write operations.

	* res/res_pjsip.c: Fix potential deadlock situation in res_pjsip.
	  SIP transaction timeouts are handled in the PJSIP monitor thread.
	  When this happens on a subscription, and the subscription is
	  destroyed, the subscription destruction is dispatched
	  synchronously to the threadpool. The issue is that the PJSIP
	  dialog is locked by the monitor thread, and then the dispatched
	  task attempts to lock the dialog. This leads to a deadlock that
	  causes SIP traffic to no longer be accepted on the Asterisk
	  server. The fix here is to treat the monitor thread as if it were
	  a threadpool thread when it attempts to dispatch synchronous
	  tasks. This way, the dispatched task turns into a simple function
	  call within the same thread, and the locking issue is averted.

	  while the other end correctly started at 200. This meant that for
	  short session-expiries (90 seconds) combined with long ringing
	  times (e.g. 30 seconds), asterisk would wrongly assume that the
	  timer was hit before the other end thought it was time to send a
	  session refresh. This resulted in prematurely ended calls. This
	  changes the session timer to start counting first at 200 like RFC

	* res/res_config_odbc.c, /: res_config_odbc: Fix old and new

	  parameter encoding to cope with the special meaning of the
	  semi-colon. A semi-colon in a field is interpreted as if the key
	  was supplied twice, something which isn't otherwise possible with
	  fixed database columns. E.g. allow=alaw;ulaw is parsed as
	  allow=alaw and allow=ulaw. A literal semi-colon is rewritten to
	  ^3B when stored in the database. The module uses a stringfield to
	  efficiently store the encoded parameters. However, this
	  stringfield wasn't always freed in some off-nominal cases. Commit
	  r413241 fixed initialization so the encoding for INSERT and
	  DELETE queries wouldn't crash. (Only SELECTs and UPDATEs worked
	  apparently.) But that commit forgot the frees. This change cleans
	  that up. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3555/

	* main/core_unreal.c: core_unreal: Prevent double free of
	  core_unreal pvt When a channel is destroyed (such as via
	  ast_channel_release in off nominal paths in core_unreal), it will
	  attempt to free (via ast_free) the channel tech pvt. This is
	  problematic for a few reasons: 1. The channel tech pvt is an ao2
	  object in core_unreal. Free'ing the pvt directly is no good. 2.
	  The channel tech pvt's reference count is dropped just prior to
	  calling ast_channel_release, resulting in the pvt's destruction.
	  Hence, the channel destructor is free'ing an invalid pointer.
	  This patch keeps the dropping of the reference count, but sets
	  the pvt to NULL on the channel prior to releasing it. This models
	  what would occur if the channel was hung up directly.

	  this patch seems to be better for a few reasons: (1)
	  Theoretically, ast_events can be used by any module as a binary
	  representation of a Stasis message. Given the structure of an
	  ast_event object, that information has to live in the core to be
	  used universally. For example, defining the payload of a device
	  state ast_event in res_corosync could result in an incompatible
	  device state representation in another module. (2) Much of this
	  representation already lived in the core, and was not easily
	  extensible. (3) The code already existed. :-) * Stasis message
	  types now have a message formatter that converts their payload to
	  an ast_event object. * Stasis message forwarders now handle
	  forwarding to themselves. Previously this would result in an
	  infinite recursive call. Now, this simply creates a new
	  forwarding object with no forwards set up (as it is the thing it
	  is forwarding to). This is advantageous for res_corosync, as
	  returning NULL would also imply an unrecoverable error. Returning
	  a subscription in this case allows for easier handling of message
	  types that are published directly to an aggregate topic that has
	  forwarders. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3486/

	  media issues due to frame hook This patch fixes issues with
	  direct media bridges that occur after a blind transfer. These
	  issues were caught by the (currently failing)
	  pjsip/transfers/blind_transfer/caller_direct_media test. The test
	  currently fails primarily for two reasons: (1) When Bob and
	  Charlie (the transfer target and the transfer destination) enter
	  a bridge together, the framehook remains on the transfer target
	  channel until both channels are in the bridge. As it consumes
	  voice frames, the initial bridge type is a simple bridge. The
	  framehook is removed when both channels are in the bridge;
	  however, this does not currently cause the bridging framework to
	  re-evaluate the bridge. This patch adds a AST_SOFTHANGUP_UNBRIDGE
	  poke to the transfer target channel when a framehook is removed
	  so the bridge can re-evaluate itself. (2) When a channel leaves a
	  native RTP bridge, it may be leaving due to being hung up.
	  Sending a re-INVITE to a channel that is about to be hung up is
	  not nice - in fact, there's a good chance we'll send the BYE
	  request before the channel has had a chance to send back a 200
	  OK. To be somewhat nicer, this patch adds a function to channel.h
	  that allows the bridging framework to query for exactly why a
	  channel is leaving a bridge via the channel's soft hangup flags.
	  This allows it to only send the re-INVITE if there's a chance the
	  channel will survive the native bridging experience. Review:

	* /, configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  channels/sig_pri.c: chan_dahdi/sig_pri: Prevent unnecessary
	  PROGRESS events when overlap dialing is enabled. When overlap
	  dialing is enabled, the lack of inband audio available
	  information in the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE events causes an
	  interoperability problem with SIP. sig_pri doesn't know if there
	  is dialtone present when a SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE is received so it
	  assumes it is there and posts an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame. The
	  SIP channel driver then sends out a 183 Session Progress and
	  blocks the desired 180 Ringing message when the ALERTING message
	  comes in. * Made the configure script detect if the installed
	  version of libpri supports the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE enhancements. *
	  Using the new API, made generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame on
	  an incoming SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE message when the message indicates
	  inband audio is present instead of assuming that dialtone is
	  present. * Using the new API, made SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE send out an
	  inband audio available indication only if dialtone is expected.
	  The change also makes the fallback behaviour of sending the
	  PROGRESS message better by sending it only if dialtone is
	  expected. * Changed receiving a PROCEEDING message to not
	  generate an AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS frame if the progress indication
	  ie indicates non-end-to-end-ISDN. This helps interoperability
	  with SIP. * Changed sending a PROCEEDING message in response to
	  an AST_CONTROL_PROCEEDING frame to not indicate inband audio
	  available. It was silly to do so anyway because the channel
	  driver doesn't know if inband audio is even available. This helps
	  interoperability with SIP. This patch and a corresponding change
	  in libpri work together to allow Asterisk to control the inband
	  audio available progress indication ie on the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE
	  message when dialtone is present. AST-1338 #close Reported by:

	  not checking for failure, we would end up in a strange state
	  where the old database entry was still present but Asterisk
	  thought that it had been updated. Now when an entry fails to
	  update, we print a warning and delete the old contact from
	  sorcery so there is no mismatch between foreground and backend

	* /, res/res_config_pgsql.c: Return the number of rows affected by
	  a SQL insert, rather than an object ID. The realtime API
	  specifies that the store callback is supposed to return the
	  number of rows affected. res_config_pgsql was instead returning
	  an Oid cast as an int, which during any nominal execution would
	  be cast to 0. Returning 0 when more than 0 rows were inserted
	  causes problems to the function's callers. To give an idea of how
	  strange code can be, this is the necessary code change to fix a
	  device state issue reported against chan_pjsip in Asterisk 12+.
	  The issue was that the registrar would attempt to insert contacts
	  into the database. Because of the 0 return from res_config_pgsql,
	  the registrar would think that the contact was not successfully
	  inserted, even though it actually was. As such, even though the
	  contact was query-able and it was possible to call the endpoint,
	  Asterisk would "think" the endpoint was unregistered, meaning it
	  would report the device state as UNAVAILABLE instead of
	  NOT_INUSE. The necessary fix applies to all versions of Asterisk,
	  so even though the bug reported only applies to Asterisk 12+, the
	  code correction is being inserted into 1.8+. Closes issue

	* include/asterisk/spinlock.h (added), configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: This patch adds
	  support for spinlocks in Asterisk. There are cases in Asterisk
	  where it might be desirable to lock a short critical code section
	  but not incur the context switch and yield penalty of a mutex or
	  rwlock. The primary spinlock implementations execute exclusively
	  in userspace and therefore don't incur those penalties. Spinlocks
	  are NOT meant to be a general replacement for mutexes. They
	  should be used only for protecting short blocks of critical code
	  such as simple compares and assignments. Operations that may
	  block, hold a lock, or cause the thread to give up it's timeslice
	  should NEVER be attempted in a spinlock. The first use case for
	  spinlocks is in astobj2 - internal_ao2_ref. Currently the
	  manipulation of the reference counter is done with an
	  ast_atomic_fetchadd_int which works fine. When weak reference
	  containers are introduced however, there's an additional
	  comparison and assignment that'll need to be done while the lock
	  is held. A mutex would be way too expensive here, hence the
	  spinlock. Given that lock contention in this situation would be
	  infrequent, the overhead of the spinlock is only a few more
	  machine instructions than the current ast_atomic_fetchadd_int
	  call. ASTERISK-23553 #close Review:

	  for peers set with private caller presence in P-Asserted-Identity

	  and simply not send the PAI/RPID headers at all if set to 'no'.
	  By default trust_id_outbound will be set to 'legacy' which will
	  preserve the behavior prior to these patches. Extra special
	  thanks to Walter Doekes for providing advice and feedback.

	  channel name (or some channel based identifier) when the channel

	  internal_timing: Remove the option and always make it enabled if
	  a timing module is loaded. The masquerade supertest frequently
	  fails because either the local channel chain doesn't completely
	  optimize out or the DTMF handshake doesn't completely get
	  accross. Local channel optimization requires frames flowing to
	  trigger when optimization can happen. When optimization happens
	  the media frame that triggered the optimization is dropped.
	  Sending DTMF requires frames to flow in the other direction for
	  timing purposes while sending nothing. If internal timing is not
	  enabled when MOH is playing, Asterisk switches to received timing
	  when an audio frame is received. With optimization dropping media
	  frames and MOH not sending frames unless it receives frames,
	  occasionaly there are no more frames being passed and the test
	  fails. * The asterisk command line -I option and the
	  asterisk.conf internal_timing option are removed. Asterisk now
	  always uses internal timing when needed if any timing module is
	  loaded. The issue ASTERISK-14861 did this quite awhile ago in
	  v1.4 but effectively is broken if other internal timing modules
	  besides DAHDI are used. The ast_read_generator_actions() now only
	  does received timing if it has no choice for frame generators
	  like MOH, silence, and playback streaming. * Cleaned up some code

	* Asterisk 12.2.0 Released.

2014-04-21  Asterisk Development Team <asteriskteam@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 12.2.0-rc3 Released.

	* chan_sip: Add sendrpid trust options

	  In r411189, some behavior was changed which made sendrpid behavior
	  act in a more trusting manner by sending full user data for peers
	  set with private caller presence in P-Asserted-Identity headers.
	  Since this changed long time expected behaviors, we decided to pull
	  that patch when that was pointed out by the community. Instead, this
	  patch provides a trust_id_outbound setting which will expose the data
	  per RFC-3325 if set to 'yes' and simply not send the PAI/RPID headers
	  at all if set to 'no'. By default trust_id_outbound will be set to
	  'legacy' which will preserve the behavior prior to these patches.
	  Extra special thanks to Walter Doekes for providing advice and
	  feedback.

	* main/asterisk: Fix startup sequence for realtime features

	  When ASTERISK-23265/ASTERISK-23320 was fixed, it inadvertently led to
	  realtime features breaking. This was due to features loading prior to
	  realtime. This patch fixes this by loading features after loading
	  dynamic modules.

2014-04-14  Asterisk Development Team <asteriskteam@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 12.2.0-rc2 Released.

	* autoservice: fix reference leak of logger callid.

	  autoservice acquires a local reference to the logger callid of each
	  channel in a loop. This local reference was not released, causing the
	  callid of every channel in autoservice to leak. This change moves the
	  callid unref inside the loop.

	* res_hep_pjsip: Use the channel name instead of the call ID when it is
	  available

	  During discussions with Alexandr Dubovikov at Kamailio World, it
	  became apparent that while the SIP call ID is a useful identifier
	  prior to an Asterisk channel being created, it is far more preferable
	  to use the channel name (or some channel based identifier) when the
	  channel is available. Homer is smart enough to tie the various
	  messages together. This patch opts to use the channel name when it
	  is available, falling back to the call ID otherwise.

	* res_pjsip_pubsub: Set the body generation result to 0 for a valid
	  path

	  The result of the "ast_sip_pubsub_generate_body_content" was not
	  set/initialized.  Consequently, the nominal path potentially returned
	  an invalid value, thus not sending mwi notifications.

	* Stasis: Fix Stasis() bridge refcount issue

	  The Stasis() dialplan application monitors what bridge a channel is
	  in and so necessarily holds on to a bridge pointer. This change
	  ensures that it also holds on to a reference for that bridge to
	  prevent the bridge pointer from becoming a dangling pointer.

	* http: Fix spurious ERROR message in responses with no content

	  When a response has a content length of 0, fwrite would be called
	  to write a buffer with no data in it. This resulted in the following
	  classic error message:

	   [Apr  3 11:49:17] ERROR[26421] http.c: fwrite() failed: Success

	  This patch makes it so that we only attempt to write out the content
	  if the calculated content_length is non-zero.

	* res_hep: Fix crash when hep.conf not available

	  Parts of res_hep properly checked for a valid configuration object
	  before attempting to access the configuration. A check, however,
	  was missed when a packet is sent. This patch fixes the crash caused
	  by not checking if the configuration object is valid.

	  (added), res/res_hep.c (added): res_hep/res_hep_pjsip: Add a
	  HEPv3 capture agent module and a logger for PJSIP This patch adds
	  the following: (1) A new module, res_hep, which implements a
	  generic packet capture agent for the Homer Encapsulation Protocol
	  (HEP) version 3. Note that this code is based on a patch provided
	  by Alexandr Dubovikov; I basically just wrapped it up, added
	  configuration via the configuration framework, and threw in a
	  taskprocessor. (2) A new module, res_hep_pjsip, which forwards
	  all SIP message traffic that passes through the res_pjsip stack
	  over to res_hep for encapsulation and transmission to a HEPv3
	  capture server. Much thanks to Alexandr for his Asterisk patch
	  for this code and for a *lot* of patience waiting for me to port
	  it to 12/trunk. Due to some dithering on my part, this has taken
	  the better part of a year to port forward (I still blame CDRs for
	  the delay). ASTERISK-23557 #close Review:

	* main/tcptls.c, main/manager.c, /, main/http.c: http: response
	  body often missing after specific request This patch works around
	  a problem with the HTTP body being dropped from the response to a
	  specific client and under specific circumstances: a) Client
	  request comes from node.js user agent "Shred" via use of
	  swagger-client library. b) Asterisk and Client are *not* on the
	  same host or TCP/IP stack In testing this problem, it has been
	  determined that the write of the HTTP body is lost, even if the
	  data is written using low level write function. The only solution
	  found is to instruct the TCP stack with the shutdown function to
	  flush the last write and finish the transmission. See review for
	  more details. ASTERISK-23548 #close (closes issue ASTERISK-23548)

	* res/res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: PJSIP: Allow for identify
	  sections to be specified in sorcery.conf. "identify" is a special
	  type of configuration object in PJSIP because unlike the other
	  objects, it is not provided by the base res_pjsip module.
	  Instead, it is provided by the res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip
	  module. If using the default sorcery wizard
	  (config,criteria=type=identify) then things work because the
	  module that applies the default wizard is the correct module.
	  However, if attempting to use sorcery.conf to apply an alternate
	  wizard, it was not possible. If you attempted to specify the
	  identify object type in the res_pjsip section, then the object
	  could not be registered since the object was undocumented for the
	  res_pjsip module. There was no alternate configuration section
	  defined for it, so you were out of luck if you wanted to override
	  the default wizard. With this change, the identify section will
	  properly have a sorcery.conf-based wizard applied when the
	  identify definition is within the
	  res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip section.

	  bridges/bridge_softmix.c: Fix stuck channel in ARI through the
	  introduction of synchronous bridge actions. Playing back a file
	  to a channel in an ARI bridge would attempt to wait until the
	  playback concluded before returning. The method used involved
	  signaling the waiting thread in the ARI custom playback function.
	  The problem with this is that there were some corner cases that
	  were not accounted for: * If a bridge channel could not be found,
	  then we never would attempt the playback but would still attempt
	  to wait for the playback to complete. * If the bridge playfile
	  action failed to queue, we would still attempt to wait for the
	  playback to complete. * If the bridge playfile action were queued
	  but some circumstance caused the playback not to occur (the
	  bridge dies, the channel is removed from the bridge), then we
	  would never be notified. The solution to this is to move the
	  waiting logic into the bridge code. A new bridge API function is
	  added to queue a synchronous action on a bridge. The waiting
	  thread is notified when the queued frame has been freed, either
	  due to an error occurring or due to successful playback. As a
	  failsafe, the waiting thread has a 10 minute timeout just in case
	  there is a frame leak somewhere. Review:

	* res/res_pjsip_multihomed.c: res_pjsip_multihomed: Fix a bug where

	* res/res_pjsip_multihomed.c (added): res_pjsip_multihomed: Add

	  the interface the message is being sent out on. This module
	  determines what interface a message is being sent on and updates
	  the message to contain the correct address if applicable. This

	  outbound calls, both of which were experiencing detrimental
	  effects from incorrect IP addresses in SIP messages. These
	  effects were only experienced by the soft phone on the 10.24.64.0
	  network since the messages to the hard phone on the 10.24.16.0

	* res/res_musiconhold.c, /: moh: fix a refcount error with realtime
	  MOH I observed a crash in res_musiconhold on an Asterisk 11
	  system using realtime MOH. Investigation of the backtrace showed
	  a corrupt mohclass, implying that it got destroyed before the
	  code expected it to. I went looking for reference counting errors
	  that could have caused this crash and this patch this result. It
	  contains 2 changes. 1) Remove a usless block of code that was
	  impossible to reach. There was even a comment indicating that it
	  was impossible to reach. The conditional includes
	  "!ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)" and it's
	  inside of an if block with the opposite check
	  "ast_test_flag(global_flags, MOH_CACHERTCLASSES)". There's no
	  good reason to keep it around. 2) A similar block to #1 contained
	  a reference counting error. It stores state->class in the local
	  variable mohclass without increasing its reference count. The
	  reference count on mohclass is decremented at the end of the
	  function. This block of code probably very rarely runs, which
	  would help explain why this system was working fine for many
	  months before experiencing a crash. Review:

	  Create AST_SORCERY dialplan function. This patch creates the
	  AST_SORCERY dialplan function which allows someone to retrieve
	  any value from a sorcery-based config file. It's similar to
	  AST_CONFIG. The creation of the function itself was fairly
	  straightforward but it required changes to the underlying sorcery
	  infrastructure that rippled into individual sorcery objects. The
	  changes stemmed from inconsistencies in how sorcery created
	  ast_variable objectsets from sorcery objects and the
	  inconsistency in how individual objects used that feature
	  especially when it came to parameters that can be specified
	  multiple times like contact in aor and match in identify. You can
	  read more here...
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2014-February/065202.html
	  So, what this patch does, besides actually creating the
	  AST_SORCERY function, is the following... * Creates
	  ast_variable_list_append which is a helper to append one
	  ast_variable list to another. * Modifies the
	  ast_sorcery_object_field_register functions to accept the
	  already-defined sorcery_fields_handler callback. * Modifies
	  ast_sorcery_objectset_create to accept a parameter indicating
	  return type preference...a single ast_variable with all values
	  concatenated or an ast_variable list with multiple entries. Also
	  fixed a few bugs. * Modifies individual sorcery object
	  implementations to use the new function definition of the
	  ast_sorcery_object_field_register functions. * Modifies
	  location.c and res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c to implement
	  sorcery_fields_handler handlers so they return multiple
	  occurrences as an ast_variable_list. * Added a whole bunch of
	  tests to test_sorcery. (closes issue ASTERISK-22537) Review:

	* res/res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Apply packetization
	  rules on inbound SDP handling The setting 'use_ptime' is supposed
	  to tell Asterisk to honour the ptime attribute in an offer,
	  preferring it to whatever packetization preferences have been set
	  internally. Currently, however, something rather quirky will
	  happen: (1) The SDP answer will be constructed in
	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream. This will use the preferences from
	  the endpoint, such that the 200 OK response will add the
	  packetization preferences from the endpoint, and not what was
	  offered. (2) When the 200 response is issued,
	  apply_negotiated_sdp_stream is called. This will call
	  apply_packetization, which will use the ptime attribute from the
	  offer internally. We end up telling the offerer to use the
	  internal ptime attribute, but we end up using the offered ptime
	  attribute. Hilarity ensues. This patch modifies the behaviour by
	  calling apply_packetization from negotiate_incoming_sdp_stream,
	  which is called prior to create_outgoing_sdp_stream. This causes
	  the format preferences on the session's media object to be set to
	  the inbound ptime value (if 'use_ptime' is enabled), such that
	  the construction of the answer gets the right value immediately.

	* main/asterisk.c: main: Initialize dialplan providing core
	  components prior to module pre-load It is possible to pre-load

	  the dialplan - will attempt to use various dialplan components,
	  such as device state providers and presence state providers,
	  prior to them being initialized by the core. This would lead to a
	  crash, as the components had not created their Stasis cache
	  entries. This patch moves a number of core component
	  initializations before the module pre-load. This guarantees that
	  if someone does pre-load pbx_config - or other pbx modules - that
	  the Stasis caches for the various core components are created.

	  after attended transfer Updated the code to check to see if MOH
	  is playing on the transferor and if so then start it on the
	  channel that replaces it during a masquerade. Example scenario of
	  the problem: Alice calls Bob and then Bob begins the attended
	  transfer process into a queue. Upon going on hold Alice hears
	  music and so does Bob once he is in the queue. Bob then transfers
	  Alice into the queue and then music for Alice stops even though
	  she should be hearing it since has now replaced Bob in the queue.
	  The problem that was occurring is that once the channel was
	  masqueraded the app (queues, confbridge, etc...) had no way of
	  knowing that the channel had just been swapped out thus it did
	  not start music for the present channel. Credit to Olle Johansson
	  for pointing me in the right direction on this issue. (closes

	* main/pbx.c, /: pbx: Handle a completely empty dialplan during a

	  12 - theoretically possible to load Asterisk with no dialplan
	  whatsoever. If that occurs, and some other module (that is not a
	  pbx module) attempts to merge its contexts into the dialplan, the
	  existing merge routine will crash. This is because it is not
	  insane, and rightly believes that you provided some sort of
	  dialplan, somewhere. This patch will gracefully merge the
	  contexts in such a case. Note that this is highly unlikely to
	  occur in 1.8/11, as features will most likely provide some
	  dialplan via parking. However, in Asterisk 12, parking is now
	  provided by res_parking, and hence may create its dialplan later.

	* main/stasis_endpoints.c: ARI: correct upper/lower case URI

	  In this patch, the ast_endpoint_lastest_snapshot() function is

	  lookup. This resolves the discrepancy noted by the reporter.
	  However I chose to avoid forcing the /ari prefix of the URI's to

	  using IAX2 2) v1.8 answers and sends a connected line update
	  control frame. (on v1.8 AST_CONTROL_CONNECTED_LINE = 22) 3) v1.4
	  receives the control frame as an end-of-q (on v1.4
	  AST_CONTROL_END_OF_Q = 22) 4) v1.4 disconnects the call once the

	* Asterisk 12.1.0-rc2 Released.

	* res_rtp_asterisk: Fix checklist creating problems in ICE sessions
	  
	  Prior to this patch, local candidate lists including SRFLX would
	  fail to start properly when building ICE candidate check lists. This
	  patch fixes that problem by making sure that each SRFLX candidate is
	  associated with the proper base address so that the check list can
	  create matches properly.

	  This patch was written by jcolp. The issue will be left open to await
	  testing by the issue participants.

	* res_fax: Warn that minrate=2400 is not valid for V.27 instead of
	  failing load.

	  Change minrate from 2400 to 4800 on config reload in response to
	  changes from ASTERISK-22790 only.  Any config with minrate of
	  2400 that would fail before r405693 will still fail.

	  Comment out many settings in res_fax.conf.sample. The defaults are
	  set in res_fax.c, so setting the same value in sample config does
	  nothing but make the sample config more fragile.

	* main: Initialize dialplan providing core components prior to module
	  pre-load

	  It is possible to pre-load pbx_config. As a result, pbx_config -
	  which will load and parse the dialplan - will attempt to use various
	  dialplan components, such as device state providers and presence
	  state providers, prior to them being initialized by the core. This
	  would lead to a crash, as the components had not created their Stasis
	  cache entries.

	  This patch moves a number of core component initializations before
	  the module pre-load. This guarantees that if someone does pre-load
	  pbx_config - or other pbx modules - that the Stasis caches for the
	  various core components are created.

	* ari/resource_channels: Add channel variables earlier in the creation
	  process

	  This patch tweaks the behaviour of POST /channels with channel
	  variables such that the variables are passed into the pbx.c routines
	  that perform the origination. This allows the variables to be
	  assigned to the newly	created	channels immediately upon their
	  construction, as opposed to be assigned after the originate has
	  completed.

	  The upshot of this is that the variables are available on the
	  channels if they execute in the dialplan, as opposed to only being
	  available once the channels are answered.

	* security_events: Fix assertion failure in dev-mode on optional IE
	  parsing

	  When formatting an optional IE, the value is, of course, optional. As
	  such, it is entirely appropriate for ast_json_object_get to return
	  NULL. If that occurs, we now simply skip the IE that was requested,
	  as it was not provided by the entity that raised the event.

	  Thanks to George Joseph (gtjoseph) for catching this and reporting it
	  in #asterisk-dev

	* funcs/func_cdr: Handle empty time values when extracting parsed
	  values

	  When extracting timestamps that are parsed, time stamp values that
	  are not set (time values of 0.000000) should not actually result in
	  a parsed string. The value should be skipped, and the result of the
	  CDR function should be an empty string.

	  Prior to this patch, the result was fed to the time formatting, which
	  would result in an output of a date/time in 1969.

	* security_events: Fix error caused by DTD validation error

	  The appdocsxml.dtd specifies that a "required" attribute in a
	  parameter may have a value of yes, no, true, or false. On some
	  systems, specifying "False" instead of "false" would cause a
	  validation error. This patch fixes the casing to explicitly match
	  the DTD.

	  main/bridge_after.c, UPGRADE.txt: CDRs: fix a variety of dial
	  status problems, h/hangup handler creating CDRs This patch fixes
	  a number of small-ish problems that were noticed when witnessing
	  the records that the FreePBX dialplan produces: (1) Mid-call
	  events (as well as privacy options) have the ability to change
	  the overall state of the Dial operation after the called party
	  answers. This means that publishing the DialEnd event when the
	  called party is premature; we have to wait for the execution of
	  these subroutines to complete before we can signal the overall
	  status of the DialEnd. This patch moves that publication and adds
	  handlers for the mid-call events. (2) The AST_FLAG_OUTGOING
	  channel flag is cleared if an after bridge goto datastore is
	  detected. This flag was preventing CDRs from being recorded for
	  all outbound channels that had a 'continue' option enabled on
	  them by the Dial application. (3) The CDR engine now locks the
	  'Dial' application as being the CDR application if it detects
	  that the current CDR has entered that app. This is similar to the
	  logic that is done for Parking. In general, if we entered into
	  Dial, then we want that CDR to record the application as such -
	  this prevents pre-dial handlers, mid-call handlers, and other
	  shenaniganry from changing the application value. (4) The CDR
	  engine now checks for the AST_SOFTHANGUP_HANGUP_EXEC in more
	  places to determine if the channel is in hangup logic or dead. In
	  either case, we don't want to record changes in the channel. (5)
	  The default option for "endbeforehexten" has been changed to
	  "yes". In general, you don't want to see CDRs in the 'h' exten or
	  in hangup logic. Since the semantics of that option changed in
	  12, it made sense to update the default value as well. (6)
	  Finally, because we now have the ability to synchronize on the
	  messages published to the CDR topic, on shutdown the CDR engine
	  will now synchronize to the messages currently in flight. This
	  helps to ensure that all in-flight CDRs are written before
	  shutting down. (closes issue ASTERISK-23164) Reported by: Matt

	* apps/app_dial.c, /: app_dial: Allow macro/gosub pre-bridge
	  execution to occur on priorities The parsing for the destination
	  of the macro/gosub uses the '^' character to separate out
	  context, extension, and priority. However, the logic for the
	  macro/gosub execution was written such that it would only do the
	  actual macro/gosub jump if a '^' character existed. This doesn't
	  apply when the macro/gosub jump occurs in a priority/priority
	  label. This patch changes the logic so that the parsing still
	  occurs, but the jump will occur even for priorities/priority
	  labels. (issue ASTERISK-23164) Review:

	  res/res_pjsip_mwi.c: Decouple subscription handling from
	  NOTIFY/PUBLISH body generation. When the PJSIP pubsub framework
	  was created, subscription handlers were required to state what
	  event they handled along with what body types they knew how to
	  generate. While this serves well when implementing a base RFC, it
	  has problems when trying to extend the body to support
	  non-standard or proprietary body elements. The code also was
	  NOTIFY-specific, meaning that when the time comes that we start
	  writing code to send out PUBLISH requests with MWI or presence
	  bodies, we would likely find ourselves duplicating code that had
	  previously been written. This changeset introduces the concept of
	  body generators and body supplements. A body generator is
	  responsible for allocating a native structure for a given body
	  type, providing the primary body content, converting the native
	  structure to a string, and deallocating resources. A body
	  supplement takes the primary body content (the native structure,
	  not a string) generated by the body generator and adds
	  nonstandard elements to the body. With these elements living in
	  their own module, it becomes easy to extend our support for body
	  types and to re-use resources when sending a PUBLISH request.
	  Body generators and body supplements register themselves with the
	  pubsub core, similar to how subscription and publish handlers had
	  done. Now, subscription handlers do not need to know what type of
	  body content they generate, but they still need to inform the
	  pubsub core about what the default body type for a given event
	  package is. The pubsub core keeps track of what body generators
	  and body supplements have been registered. When a SUBSCRIBE
	  arrives, the pubsub core will check that there is a subscription
	  handler for the event in the SUBSCRIBE, then it will check that
	  there is a body generator that can provide the content specified
	  in the Accept header(s). Because of the nature of body generators
	  and supplements, it means res_pjsip_exten_state and res_pjsip_mwi
	  have been completely gutted. They no longer worry about body
	  types, instead calling ast_sip_pubsub_generate_body_content()
	  when they need to generate a NOTIFY body. Review:

	  pjsip: fix support for allow=all This change adds improvements to
	  support for allow=all in pjsip.conf so that it functions as
	  intended. Previously, the allow/disallow socery configuration
	  would set & clear codecs from the media.codecs and media.prefs
	  list, but if all was specified the prefs list was not updated.
	  Then a call would fail when create_outgoing_sdp_stream() created
	  an SDP with no audio codecs. A new function
	  ast_codec_pref_append_all() is provided to add all codecs to the
	  prefs list - only those not already on the list. This enables the
	  configuration to specify a codec preference, but still add all
	  codecs, and even then remove some codecs, as shown in this
	  example: allow = ulaw, alaw, all, !g729, !g723 Also, the display
	  order of allow in cli output is updated to match the
	  configuration by using prefs instead of caps when generating a
	  human readable string. Finally, a change to
	  create_outgoing_sdp_stream() skips a codec when it does not have

	  performance of console verbose messages. The per console verbose
	  level feature as previously implemented caused a large
	  performance penalty. The fix required some minor
	  incompatibilities if the new rasterisk is used to connect to an
	  earlier version. If the new rasterisk connects to an older
	  Asterisk version then the root console verbose level is always
	  affected by the "core set verbose" command of the remote console
	  even though it may appear to only affect the current console. If
	  an older version of rasterisk connects to the new version then
	  the "core set verbose" command will have no effect. * Fixed the
	  verbose performance by not generating a verbose message if
	  nothing is going to use it and then filtered any generated
	  verbose messages before actually sending them to the remote
	  consoles. * Split the "core set debug" and "core set verbose" CLI
	  commands to remove the per module verbose support that cannot
	  work with the per console verbose level. * Added a silent option
	  to the "core set verbose" command. * Fixed "core set debug off"
	  tab completion. * Made "core show settings" list the current
	  console verbosity in addition to the root console verbosity. *
	  Changed the default verbose level of the 'verbose' setting in the
	  logger.conf [logfiles] section. The default is now to once again
	  follow the current root console level. As a result, using the AMI
	  Command action with "core set verbose" could again set the root
	  console verbose level and affect the verbose level logged.

	  applications that manipulate CDRs with the engine In
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/3057/, applications and
	  functions that manipulate CDRs were made to interact over Stasis.
	  This was done to synchronize manipulations of CDRs from the
	  dialplan with the updates the engine itself receives over the
	  message bus. This change rested on a faulty premise: that
	  messages published to the CDR topic or to a topic that forwards
	  to the CDR topic are synchronized with the messages handled by
	  the CDR topic subscription in the CDR engine. This is not the
	  case. There is no ordering guaranteed for two messages published
	  to the same topic; ordering is only guaranteed if a message is
	  published to the same subscriber. Stasis was modified in r405311
	  to allow a publisher to synchronize on the subscriber. This patch
	  uses that API to synchronize the CDR publishers with the CDR
	  engine message router, which maintains the overall topic
	  subscription. (closes issue ASTERISK-22884) Reported by: Matt

	* apps/app_confbridge.c, apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c,
	  /: app_confbridge: Fix crash caused when waitmarked/marked users
	  leave together When waitmarked users join a ConfBridge, the
	  conference state is transitioned from EMPTY -> INACTIVE. In this
	  state, the users are maintined in a waiting users list. When a
	  marked user joins, the ConfBridge conference transitions from
	  INACTIVE -> MULTI_MARKED, and all users are put onto the active
	  list of users. This process works correctly. When the marked user
	  leaves, if they are the last marked user, the MULTI_MARKED state
	  does the following: (1) It plays back a message to the bridge
	  stating that the leader has left the conference. This requires an
	  unlocking of the bridge. (2) It moves waitmarked users back to
	  the waiting list (3) It transitions to the appropriate state: in
	  this case, INACTIVE However, because it plays the prompt back to
	  the bridge before moving the users and before finishing the state
	  transition, this creates a race condition: with the bridge
	  unlocked, waitmarked users who leave the conference (or are
	  kicked from it) can cause a state transition of the bridge to
	  another state before the conference is transitioned to the
	  INACTIVE state. This causes the state machine to get a bit wonky,
	  often leading to a crash when the MULTI_MARKED state attempts to
	  conclude its processing. This patch fixes this problem: (1) It
	  prevents kicked users from being kicked again. That's just a
	  nicety. (2) More importantly, it fixes the race condition by only
	  playing the prompt once the state has transitioned correctly to
	  INACTIVE. If waitmarked users sneak out during the prompt being
	  played, no harm no foul. Review:

	  "deviceState", not "device_state". The code, however, used
	  "device_state"; although this was inconsistent as well in doxygen
	  comments in resource_applications. Because the actual resource
	  being subscribed to is /deviceStates/{device}/, it makes sense
	  for the resource type specifier to be deviceState. Note that the
	  key value in the events is still "device_state".

	* include/asterisk/manager.h: manager: bump version to 2.0.0 AMI
	  has received substantial updates over the past year. Not only has
	  the syntax been vastly improved and made consistent (which
	  entails many event changes), but the underlying things that those
	  events convey have changed substantially as well. After some
	  conversation in #asterisk-dev, it was agreed that this is a good
	  time to jump to 2. At the same time, since ARI will most likely
	  use semantic versioning, we might as well use that for AMI as
	  well. That also affords us greater meaning for the AMI version.

	* include/asterisk/channel.h, res/res_pjsip.c, main/channel.c,
	  include/asterisk/autochan.h: Fix a deadlock that occurred due to
	  a conflict of masquerades. For the explanation, here is a
	  copy-paste of the review board explanation: Initially, it was
	  discovered that performing an attended transfer of a multiparty
	  bridge with a PJSIP channel would cause a deadlock. A PBX thread
	  started a masquerade and reached the point where it was calling
	  the fixup() callback on the "original" channel. For chan_pjsip,
	  this involves pushing a synchronous task to the session's
	  serializer. The problem was that a task ahead of the fixup task
	  was also attempting to perform a channel masquerade. However,
	  since masquerades are designed in a way to only allow for one to
	  occur at a time, the task ahead of the fixup could not continue
	  until the masquerade already in progress had completed. And of
	  course, the masquerade in progress could not complete until the
	  task ahead of the fixup task had completed. Deadlock. The initial
	  fix was to change the fixup task to be asynchronous. While this
	  prevented the deadlock from occurring, it had the frightful side
	  effect of potentially allowing for tasks in the session's
	  serializer to operate on a zombie channel. Taking a step back
	  from this particular deadlock, it became clear that the problem
	  was not really this one particular issue but that masquerades
	  themselves needed to be addressed. A PJSIP attended transfer
	  operation calls ast_channel_move(), which attempts to both set up
	  and execute a masquerade. The problem was that after it had set
	  up the masquerade, the PBX thread had swooped in and tried to
	  actually perform the masquerade. Looking at changes that had been
	  made to Asterisk 12, it became clear that there never is any time
	  now that anyone ever wants to set up a masquerade and allow for
	  the channel thread to actually perform the masquerade. Everyone
	  always is calling ast_channel_move(), performs the masquerade
	  itself before returning. In this patch, I have removed all blocks
	  of code from channel.c that will attempt to perform a masquerade
	  if ast_channel_masq() returns true. Now, there is no distinction
	  between setting up a masquerade and performing the masquerade. It
	  is one operation. The only remaining checks for
	  ast_channel_masq() and ast_channel_masqr() are in ast_hangup()
	  since we do not want to interrupt a masquerade by hanging up the
	  channel. Instead, now ast_hangup() will wait for a masquerade to
	  complete before moving forward with its operation. The
	  ast_channel_move() function has been modified to basically
	  in-line the logic that used to be in ast_channel_masquerade().
	  ast_channel_masquerade() has been killed off for real.
	  ast_channel_move() now has a lock associated with it that is used
	  to prevent any simultaneous moves from occurring at once. This
	  means there is no need to make sure that ast_channel_masq() or
	  ast_channel_masqr() are already set on a channel when
	  ast_channel_move() is called. It also means the channel container
	  lock is not pulling double duty by both keeping the container
	  locked and preventing multiple masquerades from occurring
	  simultaneously. The ast_do_masquerade() function has been renamed
	  to do_channel_masquerade() and is now internal to channel.c. The
	  function now takes explicit arguments of which channels are
	  involved in the masquerade instead of a single channel. While it
	  probably is possible to do some further refactoring of this
	  method, I feel that I would be treading dangerously. Instead, all
	  I did was change some comments that no longer are true after this
	  changeset. The other more minor change introduced in this patch
	  is to res_pjsip.c to make ast_sip_push_task_synchronous() run the
	  task in-place if we are already a SIP servant thread. This is
	  related to this patch because even when we isolate the channel
	  masquerade to only running in the SIP servant thread, we would
	  still deadlock when the fixup() callback is reached since we
	  would essentially be waiting forever for ourselves to finish
	  before actually running the fixup. This makes it so the fixup is
	  run without having to push a task into a serializer at all.

	  information. The ISDN MWI support configuration options had to be
	  reworked because chan_dahdi was parsing the box@context format to

	  Synchronize with engine when manipulating state When doing the
	  rework of the CDR engine that pushed all of the logic into cdr.c
	  and made it respond to changes in channel state over Stasis, we
	  knew that accessing the CDR engine from the dialplan would be
	  "slightly" non-deterministic. Dialplan threads would be accessing
	  CDRs while Stasis threads would be updating the state of said
	  CDRs - whereas in the past, everything happened on the dialplan
	  threads. Tests have shown that "slightly" is in reality "very".
	  This patch synchronizes things by making the dialplan
	  applications/functions that manipulate CDRs do so over Stasis.
	  ForkCDR, NoCDR, ResetCDR, CDR, and CDR_PROP now all use Stasis to
	  send their requests over to the CDR engine, and synchronize on
	  the channel Stasis topic via a subscription so that they return
	  their values/control to the dialplan at the appropriate time.
	  While going through this, the following changes were also made: *
	  DISA, which can reset the CDR when a user successfully
	  authenticates, now just uses the ResetCDR app to do this. This
	  prevents having to duplicate the same Stasis synchronization
	  logic in that application. * Answer no longer disables CDRs. It
	  actually didn't work anyway - calling DISABLE on the channel's
	  CDR doesn't stop the CDR from getting the Answer time - it just
	  kills all CDRs on that channel, which isn't what the caller would
	  intend. (closes issue ASTERISK-22884) (closes issue

	  being called have had their documentation updated to indicate
	  such." The above was initially committed and then reverted at

	  publish_local_bridge_message function. The ast_unreal_lock_all
	  function locks and adds a reference to the returned channels and
	  while they were being unlocked they were not being unreffed when
	  no longer needed. Fixed by unreffing the channels. Also in
	  bridge.c a lock was obtained on "other->chan", but then an
	  attempt was made to unlock "other" and not the previously locked
	  channel. Fixed by unlocking "other->chan" (closes issue

	  include app_bridgewait, res_parking, app_confbridge, and
	  app_agent_pool. In addition, a name may now be provided as an

	* res/res_sorcery_config.c: res_sorcery_config: Output an error
	  message when an object can't be created. If object creation fails
	  an error message will now be output with the id, type, and

	* main/framehook.c: framehooks: Re-iterate if framehook provides
	  different frame. Framehooks can be used in a reactive manner to
	  execute specific logic when a frame is received with a certain
	  type and payload. Since it is possible for framehooks to provide
	  frames it was possible for this reactive framehook to be unaware
	  of frames it is looking for. This change makes it so that when
	  framehooks return a modified frame the code will now re-iterate
	  (from the beginning) and call any previous framehooks that have
	  not provided a modified frame themselves. Review:

	* res/ari/resource_channels.c: ari/resource_channels: When creating
	  a channel, specify a default format (SLIN) When creating channels
	  via ARI, the current code fails to provide any default format
	  capabilities. For non-virtual channels this isn't really a
	  problem - the channels typically receive their capabilities as a
	  result of the underlying channel driver configuration. For
	  virtual channels (such as Local channels), the lack of any format
	  capabilities causes the Asterisk core to make some 'odd' choices
	  with respect to the translation paths. The issue reporter had
	  some paths that had 3 hops on each channel leg, causing multiple
	  transcodings and some really crappy audio/performance. By
	  specifying a baseline of SLIN, we prevent that from occurring.
	  Note that this is what AMI does when it performs an Originate, as
	  does res_clioriginate. Review:

	  of privilege escalating functions This patch allows individual
	  dialplan functions to be marked as 'dangerous', to inhibit their
	  execution from external sources. A 'dangerous' function is one
	  which results in a privilege escalation. For example, if one were
	  to read the channel variable SHELL(rm -rf /) Bad Things(TM) could
	  happen; even if the external source has only read permissions.
	  Execution from external sources may be enabled by setting
	  'live_dangerously' to 'yes' in the [options] section of
	  asterisk.conf. Although doing so is not recommended. Also, the
	  ABI was changed to something more reasonable, since Asterisk 12
	  does not yet have a public release. (closes issue ASTERISK-22905)

	* res/res_fax_spandsp.c, /: res_fax_spandsp: Always init T.38
	  session to avoid crashes during state change Prior to this patch,
	  res_fax_spandsp was conservative with how it initialized the
	  spandsp T.38 context. It would only initialize it if the driver
	  thought the current state was a T.38 fax. While this works fine
	  in nominal situations, in certain off nominal situations,
	  res_fax_spandsp can believe that a T.38 fax will not occur when
	  in fact one has started. In particular, this was discovered when
	  res_fax would fall back to audio after timing out on a T.38
	  upgrade. The SIP channel driver would continue to retry the
	  re-INVITE and - if the remote end responded after res_fax timed
	  out with a 200 OK - a T.38 frame would be delivered to the
	  res_fax stack when it no longer expected it. As it turns out,
	  there does not appear to be any downside to always initializing
	  the T.38 context, other than the actual memory allocation. Since
	  that avoids this off nominal situation (and others which are
	  equally likely hard to predict), this is the safest way to avoid
	  this problem. Much thanks to Torrey as well for providing a
	  scenario that reproduces this issue. (closes issue

	* res/res_pjsip.c: Initialize the hash value argument to

	  was possible for received headers to be added as well (since they
	  are stored for retrieval using the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan
	  function). This caused a broken (and potentially large) SIP

	  reloading certain configurations. Certain options available that
	  specify a SIP URI perform validation on the provided URI using
	  the PJSIP URI parser. This operation requires that the thread
	  executing it be registered with the PJLIB library. During reloads
	  this was done on a thread which was NOT registered with it. This
	  fixes the problem by creating a task which reloads the
	  configuration on a PJSIP thread. (closes issue ASTERISK-22923)

	  provides a request body with a Content type of
	  "application/json", the provided JSON document is parsed and
	  searched for parameters. The expected fields in the provided JSON
	  document should match the query parameters defined for the
	  operation. If the parameter has 'allowMultiple' set, then the
	  field in the JSON document may optionally be an array of values.

	  possible to inform the translation function that the source frame

	  pjmedia_sdp_rtpmap_to_attr will attempt to use the string
	  rtpmap.param regardless of its length value. Simply setting the
	  length to 0 does not prevent the garbage on the stack in
	  rtpmap.param.ptr from being formatted in a sprintf call. This
	  patch initializes the string to NULL so that at the very least,
	  something is provided to the function that is predictable.

	* res/res_pjsip_mwi.c: res_pjsip_mwi: Fix memory leak of MWI
	  subscriptions container This patch fixes a reference counting
	  memory leak on the ao2_container created as part of
	  create_mwi_subscriptions. When we create the container in this
	  routine, the intent is to hand lifetime ownership over to the
	  global container unsolicited_mwi. When
	  ao2_global_obj_replace_unref is called, the reference count on
	  mwi_subscriptions (the container) will be bumped by 1; however,
	  the function does not decrement the reference count on
	  mwi_subscriptions when this occurs. This will prevent the
	  container from being fully disposed of when Asterisk exits (or on
	  any subsequent call to this operation, such as during a reload).

	  channel.answerChannel() channel.muteChannel() Etc. We put the
	  object name in the nickname (since we were generating C code),

	  nicknames more OO friendly. This resulted in a lot of name
	  changing within the res_ari_*.so modules, but not much else.
	  There were a couple of other fixed I made in the process. * When
	  reversible operations (POST /hold, POST /unhold) were made more
	  RESTful (POST /hold, DELETE /unhold), the path for the second
	  operation was left in the API declaration. This worked, but
	  really the two operations should have been on the same API. * The
	  POST /unmute operation had still not been REST-ified. Review:

	* apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: crash if first agent is "busy" If
	  the first agent/member (via CLI "queue show") in a queue is
	  "busy" (dnd, circuit busy, etc...) and no agents answered then
	  app_queue would crash. This occurred because while the calling of
	  agent(s) remained valid the channel on "busy" agent would be set
	  to NULL and then later dereferenced upon a second "rna" function
	  call. The original intention of the code is to have only valid
	  "call attempt" objects (channels != NULL) checked while
	  attempting to call agent(s). It does this by building a
	  "call_next" list of valid "call attempt" objects. In the case of
	  the "busy" agent subsequent builds of the valid "call attempt"
	  list would sometimes include (the case mentioned above) an
	  invalid "call attempt" object. The fix was to make sure the "call
	  attempt" list was appropriately built on every iteration. A NULL
	  sanity check was also added at the original offending spot of the
	  crash just in case another one slipped by somehow. (closes issue

	  includes sys/socket.h; however, since the code base is already
	  liberally sprinkled with the usage of AST_AF_* (as well as with

	* main/stasis_channels.c: stasis_channels: Don't give preference to
	  ANI info in channel snapshots When publishing channel snapshots,
	  we currently compute the caller ID name and number by giving
	  preference first to ani.{name|number}, then to id.{name|number}.
	  However, when a channel driver (such as chan_sip) updates the
	  caller ID, it typically only updates the caller ID stored in
	  id.{name|number}. This means that we are currently giving
	  preference to stale information. When looking at the rest of the
	  code base, the only other place where we appear to use this same
	  logic is in app_amd. Everywhere else, we treat the party
	  information in ani as being separate to the party information in
	  id. This patch publishes only the caller ID name and number in
	  the snapshot field for caller_name and caller_num. Note that the
	  information in ANI is still available in caller_ani. Review:

	* main/loader.c, /: core/loader: Don't call dlclose in a while loop
	  For awhile now, we've noticed continuous integration builds
	  hanging on CentOS 6 64-bit build agents. After resolving a number
	  of problems with symbols, strange locks, and other shenanigans,
	  the problem has persisted. In all cases, gdb shows the Asterisk
	  process stuck in loader.c on one of the infinite while loops that
	  calls dlclose repeatedly until success. The documentation of
	  dlclose states that it returns 0 on success; any other value on
	  error. It does not state that repeatedly calling it will
	  eventually clear those errors. Most likely, the repeated calls to
	  dlclose was to force a close by exhausting the references on the
	  library; however, that will never succeed if: (a) There is some
	  fundamental error at work in the loaded library that precludes
	  unloading it (b) Some other loaded module is referencing a symbol
	  in the currently loaded module This results in Asterisk sitting
	  forever. Since we have matching pairs of dlopen/dlclose, this
	  patch opts to only call dlclose once, and log out as an ERROR if
	  dlclose fails to return success. If nothing else, this might help
	  to determine why on the CentOS 6 64-bit build agent things are
	  not closing successfully. Review:

	* /, main/translate.c, main/xmldoc.c, main/channel.c, main/pbx.c:
	  Remove some spammy debug messages; improve clarity of others
	  Debug messages aren't free. Even when the debug level is
	  sufficiently low such that the messages are never evaluated,
	  there is a cost to having to parse Asterisk logs that contain
	  debug messages that (a) fail to convey sufficient information or
	  (b) occur so frequently as to be next to meaningless. Based on
	  having to stare at lots of DEBUG messages, this patch makes the
	  following changes: * channel.c: When copying variables from a
	  parent channel to a child channel, specify the channels involved.
	  Do not log anything for a variable that is not inherited; the
	  fact that it doesn't have an _ or __ already signifies that it
	  won't be inherited. * pbx.c: Specify what function evaluation has
	  occurred that created the result. * translate.c: Bump up the
	  translator path messages to 10. I've never once had to use these
	  debug messages, and for each format that is registered (on
	  startup) and unregistered (on shutdown) the entire f^2 matrix is
	  logged out. For short tests in the Asterisk Test Suite, this
	  should make finding the actual test much easier. * xmldoc.c: The
	  debug message that 'blah' is not found in the tree is expected.
	  Often, description elements - which are not required - are not
	  provided. This debug message adds no additional value, as it is
	  not indicative of an error or helpful in debugging which element
	  did not contain a 'blah' element as a child. If an element is
	  supposed to contain a child element, then that XML tree should
	  have failed validation in the first place. Review:

	* UPGRADE.txt, /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Clarify
	  'Forcerport' Setting Displayed When Running "sip show peers"
	  While looking at ASTERISK-22236, Walter Doekes pointed out that
	  when running "sip show peers", the setting being displayed can be
	  confusing. The display of "N" used to mean NAT (i.e. yes). The
	  NAT setting has gone through many different changes resulting in
	  the display of different characters to try and convey what the
	  current setting is for 'Forcerport' (A for Auto and Forcerport is
	  currently on, a for Auto but Forcerport is off, Y for yes, and N
	  for no). During the initial code review to try and clarify these
	  settings (especially since "N" no longer meant what it used to
	  mean in prior versions of Asterisk), Mark Michelson suggested
	  using the full space available to display the settings which
	  helped to make the settings very clear. That was a great
	  suggestion. Therefore, this patch does the following: * The
	  column for 'Forcerport' now will show: Auto (Yes), Auto (No),
	  Yes, or No. * A column for the 'Comedia' setting has been added.
	  It too will display the setting in a non-cryptic way: Auto (Yes),
	  Auto (No), Yes, or No. * UPGRADE.txt has been updated to document
	  this change. (closes issue ASTERISK-22728) Reported by: Walter

	* main/manager.c, main/bridge.c, main/bucket.c, main/sorcery.c,
	  main/cli.c: Resolve some memory leaks due to incorrect for loop /
	  ao2 ref usage. A common idiom in Asterisk is to due something
	  like: for (ao2_obj = list_beginning; ao2_obj = next_item;
	  ao2_ref(ao2_obj, -1)) { ...do stuff... } This is nice because it
	  automatically takes care of the object references for you.
	  However, there is a pitfall here. If a break statement is in the
	  for loop, then the current reference is not cleaned up. In some

	* apps/app_dial.c, main/channel.c, res/res_fax.c,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h: Add channel lock protection around
	  translation path setup. Most callers of
	  ast_channel_make_compatible() happen before the channels enter a
	  two party bridge. With the new bridging framework, two party
	  bridging technologies may also call ast_channel_make_compatible()
	  when there is more than one thread involved with the two
	  channels. * Added channel lock protection in set_format() and

	  channel's native formats while setting up a translation path. *
	  Fixed best_src_fmt and best_dst_fmt usage consistency in

	  dealing with ast_channel_make_compatible(). The deadlock

	* main/channel.c, /: Properly copy/remove the device state cache
	  flag over a masquerade. In r378303 the
	  AST_FLAG_DISABLE_DEVSTATE_CACHE flag was added that tells the
	  devstate system to not cache states for non-real devices.
	  However, when optimizing away channels (ast_do_masquerade), that
	  flag wasn't copied. In my case, using Local devices as queue
	  members created a situation where the endpoint was considered in
	  use, but the state change of the device being available again was
	  ignored (not cached). The endpoint channel was optimized into the
	  (previously) Local channel, but kept the do-not-cache flag. The
	  end result being that the queue member apparently stayed in use
	  forever. (closes issue ASTERISK-22718) Reported by: Walter Doekes

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix Setting A chan_sip Dialog's
	  SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT Flag A condition was added in a commit to fix
	  ASTERISK-21374, that, if the SIP_PAGE3_NAT_AUTO_RPORT flag was
	  set, to then copy a peer's SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT flag to the
	  dialog. This condition should not have been there since it
	  assumed that if Asterisk is in an environment where NAT is
	  involved, that the auto_* nat settings or force_rport setting
	  would be on in the global settings. If the nat setting in the
	  global setting is set to 'nat=no' and then turned on for peers
	  (which is not quite the recommended way, although it is allowed)
	  this flag is never copied to the dialog resulting in problems
	  like, REGISTER replies going to the wrong port. This patch
	  removes this conditional check and will now always use the peer's
	  flag which by this point in the code the checks on whether the
	  peer is behind NAT or not (if using auto_force_rport) have
	  already been run. (closes issue ASTERISK-22236) Reported by:

	  supplemental session callback is registered that takes the
	  pjsip_hdrs from the incoming session and stores them in a linked
	  list in the session datastore. Calls to PJSIP_HEADER traverse
	  over the list and return the nth matching header where 'n' is the
	  'number' argument to the function. When adding a header, the
	  first call creates a datastore and linked list and adds the
	  datastore to the session. The header is then created as a
	  pjsip_hdr and added to the list. An outgoing supplemental session
	  callback then traverses the list and adds the headers to the
	  outgoing pjsip_msg. When removing a header, the list created with
	  PJSIP_HEADER(add,...) is traversed and all matching entries are
	  removed. (closes issue ASTERISK-22498) Reported by: George Joseph

	* res/res_pjsip/pjsip_options.c: Push CLI qualify into the
	  threadpool. If you run Asterisk in the background and then
	  connect to it through a separate console, the thread that runs
	  CLI commands is not registered with PJLIB. Thus PJLIB does not
	  like it when you attempt to send OPTIONS requests from that
	  thread. So now we push the task into the threadpool, which we
	  know to be registered with PJLIB. Thanks to Antti Yrjola for
	  reporting this.

	* res/res_agi.c, apps/app_queue.c: Make app_queue and res_agi
	  independent of AMI being enabled. The
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2888/ review changes manager
	  to not subscribe to stasis when it is disabled for performance
	  reasons. When manager is disabled app_queue and res_agi decline
	  to load and fail to clean up what they have already allocated. *
	  Made app_queue and res_agi clean up allocated resources when they
	  decline to load. * Made app_queue and res_agi use their own
	  subscriptions to the stasis topics instead of borrowing manager's

	* apps/app_queue.c, /: app_queue: Fix Queuelog EXITWITHKEY only
	  logging two of four fields Commit r62462 added two extra fields
	  for logging "the original position the caller entered the queue
	  at, and the amount of time the caller was waiting in the queue."
	  But when r75969 was merged from 1.4 into trunk (r75977), these
	  two fields disappeared. Those two extra fields were not logged in
	  1.4 and when the patch was merged, those fields went away.
	  Therefore, this is a regression and was caught by the reporter
	  because he was reading the awesome "Asterisk: The Definitive
	  Guide" book. (closes issue ASTERISK-22197) Reported by: Dalius M.

	  it is loaded, it no longer will immediately issue log messages.
	  Upon loading, it is in the disabled state and must be turned on
	  with the new CLI command. The CLI command 'pjsip set logger
	  <on/off/host> has been added and can be used to do the following:
	  pjsip set logger on: Enables logger for all PJSIP traffic pjsip

	* main/channel_internal_api.c: Remove publication of a channel
	  snapshot when the technology is set This patch removes said
	  publication for a few reasons: (1) It is unnecessary. Association
	  of the channel technology with a specific channel is an
	  implementation detail that should be assumed to "just happen",
	  and consumers of Stasis don't need to be informed about it. (2)
	  Publication of said message can now cause crashes, as the actual
	  creation of a channel in normal locations now stages its
	  messages. As a result, things that create dummy channels (such as
	  the SIP RTP QOS unit test) and associate them with a channel
	  technology were now crashing, as the channel itself was not known
	  by Stasis.

	* include/asterisk/bridge_technology.h,
	  bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c: Fix assumption in
	  bridge_native_rtp.c regarding number of participants in a bridge.
	  When a party leaves a bridge, there may be more participants in
	  the bridge than expected. As such, it is important not to make
	  assumptions regarding the list of channels in a bridge. This
	  change makes it so that when a party leaves a native RTP bridge,
	  we unbridge it and the party it was bridged with. Previously, the
	  first and last channels in the list were unbridged since it was
	  assumed that these were the two channels that had been bridged.
	  As previously stated, a new party had been inserted into the
	  bridge, so this logic did not work properly. (closes issue

	  on the ast_format_cap for cases where string representations may
	  be requested frequently. When formats are altered, the string
	  cache is marked as invalid. When strings are requested, the cache
	  validity is checked. If the cache is valid, then the cached

	  Stasis publishing While looking for areas for performance
	  improvement, I realized that an unused feature in Stasis was
	  negatively impacting performance. When a message is sent to a
	  subscriber, a dispatch object is allocated for the dispatch,
	  containing the topic the message was published to, the subscriber
	  the message is being sent to, and the message itself. The topic
	  is actually unused by any subscriber in Asterisk today. And the
	  subscriber is associated with the taskprocessor the message is
	  being dispatched to. First, this patch removes the unused topic
	  parameter from Stasis subscription callbacks. Second, this patch
	  introduces the concept of taskprocessor local data, data that may
	  be set on a taskprocessor and provided along with the data
	  pointer when a task is pushed using the
	  ast_taskprocessor_push_local() call. This allows the task to have
	  both data specific to that taskprocessor, in addition to data
	  specific to that invocation. With those two changes, the dispatch
	  object can be removed completely, and the message is simply
	  refcounted and sent directly to the taskprocessor. Review:

	  forwards are dispatched This patch optimizes how forwards are

	  subscriptions that are invoked on the publishing thread. This did
	  not account for the vast number of forwards we would end up
	  having in the system, and the amount of work it would take to
	  walk though the forward subscriptions. This patch modifies Stasis
	  so that rather than walking the tree of forwards on every
	  dispatch, when forwards and subscriptions are changed, the
	  subscriber list for every topic in the tree is changed. This has
	  a couple of benefits. First, this reduces the workload of
	  dispatching messages. It also reduces contention when dispatching
	  to different topics that happen to forward to the same
	  aggregation topic (as happens with all of the channel, bridge and
	  endpoint topics). Since forwards are no longer subscriptions, the
	  bulk of this patch is simply changing stasis_subscription objects
	  to stasis_forward objects (which, admittedly, I should have done
	  in the first place.) Since this required me to yet again put in a
	  growing array, I finally abstracted that out into a set of
	  ast_vector macros in asterisk/vector.h. Review:

	  Taskprocessor optimization; switch Stasis to use taskprocessors
	  This patch optimizes taskprocessor to use a semaphore for
	  signaling, which the OS can do a better job at managing
	  contention and waiting that we can with a mutex and condition.
	  The taskprocessor execution was also slightly optimized to reduce
	  the number of locks taken. The only observable difference in the
	  taskprocessor implementation is that when the final reference to
	  the taskprocessor goes away, it will execute all tasks to
	  completion instead of discarding the unexecuted tasks. For
	  systems where unnamed semaphores are not supported, a really
	  simple semaphore implementation is provided. (Which gives
	  identical performance as the original taskprocessor
	  implementation). The way we ended up implementing Stasis caused
	  the threadpool to be a burden instead of a boost to performance.
	  This was switched to just use taskprocessors directly for
	  subscriptions. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2881/

	  Stasis performance improvements This patch addresses several
	  performance problems that were found in the initial performance
	  testing of Asterisk 12. The Stasis dispatch object was allocated
	  as an AO2 object, even though it has a very confined lifecycle.
	  This was replaced with a straight ast_malloc(). The Stasis
	  message router was spending an inordinate amount of time
	  searching hash tables. In this case, most of our routers had 6 or
	  fewer routes in them to begin with. This was replaced with an
	  array that's searched linearly for the route. We more heavily
	  rely on AO2 objects in Asterisk 12, and the memset() in ao2_ref()
	  actually became noticeable on the profile. This was #ifdef'ed to
	  only run when AO2_DEBUG was enabled. After being misled by an
	  erroneous comment in taskprocessor.c during profiling, the wrong
	  comment was removed. Review:

	  many packets we expect to receive. When the SSRC for an RTP

	  don't reset the number of received packets, sequence number
	  count, and other metrics used by RTCP, the next RR/SR report will
	  use the previous SSRC's values to calculate the lost packet count
	  for the new SSRC - resulting in a very large number of lost
	  packets. This patch modifies res_rtp_asterisk such that, if it
	  detects a SSRC change, it will reset the various values used by
	  the RTCP calculations. From the perspective of RTCP, this appears
	  as a new media stream - which is what it is. Review:

	* main/cdr.c: CDR: Improve handling of parking; resolve assertion
	  when originating into park This patch covers two problems: 1)
	  Currently, when a call is transferred into a parking lot from a
	  bridge (using either the blind transfer or one touch parking
	  mechanisms), the application fails to be set to "Park" in the
	  resulting CDR record for the parked channel. This is due to the
	  ParkedCall message arriving before the BridgeEnter for the
	  channel entering the parking bridge. The ParkedCall message isn't
	  handled as the CDR for the channel has already been finalized
	  (due to the channel having left its two party bridge), and the
	  BridgeEnter - which creates the new CDR - doesn't have the
	  parking information. This patch modifies the behavior so that
	  reception of a ParkedCall message will - if not handled by a CDR
	  chain - cause a new CDR to be created and put into the Parking
	  state. 2) It fixes a FRACK that occurred when a channel is
	  originated into a parking space. The DialedPending state - which
	  occurs for both Dialed and Originated channels - assumed that it
	  couldn't handle the parking transitions due to it having a Party
	  B; however, Originated channels don't have a Party B. As such,
	  the existing CDR needs to transition into the parking state -
	  this patch does that. Review:

	* apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: Make manager events tolerant of
	  Local channel shenanigans app_queue currently attempts to handle
	  Local channel optimizations in an effort to provide accurate
	  information in Stasis messages (and their corresponding AMI
	  events) as well as the Queue log. Sometimes, however, things
	  don't go as planned. Consider the following scenario: SIP/foo <->
	  L;1 <-> L;2 <-> SIP/agent SIP/agent answers, triggering a Local
	  channel optimization. app_queue will normally do the following: *
	  Listen for the Local optimization events and update our agent
	  accordingly to SIP/agent in the queue log and messages * When we
	  get a hangup, publish the AgentComplete event based on our
	  information (SIP/foo and SIP/agent) However, as with all things
	  that depend on sanity from something as capricious as Local
	  channels, things can go wrong: (1) SIP/agent immediately hangs up
	  upon answering. This triggers a race condition between
	  termination messages coming from SIP/agent and the ongoing Local
	  channel optimization messages. (Note that this can also occur
	  with SIP/foo) (2) In a race condition, Asterisk can (rarely)
	  deliver the hangup messages prior to the Local channel
	  optimization. In that case, the messages *may* arrive to
	  app_queue in the following order: * Hangup SIP/Agent * Hangup
	  SIP/foo * Optimize L;1/L;2 * Hangup L;2 * Hangup L;1 When
	  app_queue receives the hangup of the agent or the caller, it will
	  attempt to publish the AgentComplete event. However, it now has a
	  problem - it thinks its agent is the ;1 side of the Local
	  channel, as it never received the optimization event. At the same
	  time, that channel is already gone. This results in getting NULL
	  from the Stasis cache. What's more, we can't really wait for the
	  optimization message, as we are currently handling the hangup of
	  the channel that the optimization event would tell us to use.
	  This patch modifies the behavior in app_queue such that, since we
	  still have a lot of pertinent queue information (interface, queue
	  name, etc.), we now raise the event with what information we
	  know. The channels involved now may or may not be present. Users
	  will still at least get the "AgentComplete" event, which
	  "completes" the known Agent information. Review:

	* main/manager.c: manager: Fix crash when appending a manager

	  ast_channel struct, manager assumed that the struct was always
	  allocated. Since this was no longer the case, things got a bit

	  When a realtime peer sends an un-REGISTER request, Asterisk

	  What was discovered is that we are clearing out the peer's
	  registration in the database in parse_register_contact() when
	  calling expire_register() but then upon returning from
	  parse_register_contact(), update_peer() is run which stores back
	  in the database table regseconds and fullcontact. 2nd Issue The
	  reporter pointed out that the 200 ok being returned by Asterisk
	  after un-registering a peer contains a Contact header with
	  ;expires= and the Expires header is not set to 0. This is
	  actually a regression. Tests were created for this second issue
	  (ASTERISK-22548). The tests have been reviewed and a Ship It! was
	  received on those tests. This patch does the following: * Do not
	  ignore the Expires header value even when it is set to 0. The
	  patch sets the pvt->expiry earlier on in the function so that it
	  is set properly and used. * If pvt->expiry is 0, do not call
	  update_peer since that means the peer has already been
	  un-registered and there is no need to update the database record
	  again since nothing has changed. (closes issue ASTERISK-22428)

	* apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: Initialize array holding MixMonitor
	  exec options If the channel variable MONITOR_EXEC is set,
	  app_queue will pass the specified execution parameters to the

	  variable is not set, the buffer that holds the escaped value was
	  not being initialized to NULL, and so would be passed to the
	  MixMonitor application with garbage. Hilarity ensued as
	  app_mixmonitor attempted to execute gobeldy-gook.

	* main/cdr.c, main/stasis_bridges.c, tests/test_cdr.c: Fix a
	  performance problem CDRs There is a large performance price
	  currently in the CDR engine. We currently perform two
	  ao2_callback calls on a container that has an entry for every
	  channel in the system. This is done to create matching pairs
	  between channels in a bridge. As such, the portion of the CDR
	  logic that this patch deals with is how we make pairings when a
	  channel enters a mixing bridge. In general, when a channel enters
	  such a bridge, we need to do two things: (1) Figure out if anyone
	  in the bridge can be this channel's Party B. (2) Make pairings
	  with every other channel in the bridge that is not already our
	  Party B. This is a two step process. In the first step, we look
	  through everyone in the bridge and see if they can be our Party B
	  (single_state_process_bridge_enter). If they can - yay! We mark
	  our CDR as having gotten a Party B. If not, we keep searching. If
	  we don't find one, we wait until someone joins who can be our
	  Party B. Step 2 is where we changed the logic
	  (handle_bridge_pairings and bridge_candidate_process).
	  Previously, we would first find candidates - those channels in
	  the bridge with us - from the active_cdrs_by_channel container.
	  Because a channel could be a candidate if it was Party B to an
	  item in the container, the code implemented multiple
	  ao2_container callbacks to get all the candidates. We also had to
	  store them in another container with some other meta information.
	  This was rather complex and costly, particularly if you have 300
	  Local channels (600 channels!) going at once. Luckily, none of it
	  is needed: when a channel enters a bridge (which is when we're
	  figuring all this stuff out), the bridge snapshot tells us the
	  unique IDs of everyone already in the bridge. All we need to do
	  is: For all channels in the bridge: If the channel is us or our
	  Party B that we got in step 1, skip it Compare us and the
	  candidate to figure out who is Party A (based on some specific
	  rules) If we are Party A: Make a new CDR for us, append it to our
	  chain, and set the candidate as Party B If they are Party A: If
	  they don't have a Party B: Make a new CDR for them, append us to
	  their chain, and us as Party B Otherwise: Copy us over as Party B
	  on their existing CDR. This patch does that. Because we now use
	  channel unique IDs to find the candidates during bridging,
	  active_cdrs_by_channel now looks up things using uniqueid instead
	  of channel name. This makes the more complex code simpler; it
	  does, however, have the drawback that dialplan applications and
	  functions will be slightly slower as they have to iterate through
	  the container looking for the CDR by name. That's a small price
	  to pay however as the bridging code will be called a lot more
	  often. This patch also does two other minor changes: (1) It
	  reduces the container size of the channels in a bridge snapshot
	  to 1. In order to be predictable for multi-party bridges, the
	  order of the channels in the container must be stable; that is,
	  it must always devolve to a linked list. (2) CDRs and the
	  multi-party test was updated to show the relationship between two
	  dialed channels. You still want to know if they talked -
	  previously, dialed channels were always ignored, which is wrong
	  when they have managed to get a Party B. (closes issue

	* /, apps/confbridge/conf_state_multi_marked.c: Confbridge: empty
	  conference not being torn down Confbridge would not properly tear
	  down an empty conference bridge when all users were kicked via
	  end_marked=yes and at least one user was also set to wait_marked.
	  This occurred because while end_marked users were being kicked
	  and at least one was also set to wait_marked then the leave
	  wait_marked handler would be called on that user, but there would
	  be no waiting user (still considered active). The waiting users
	  would decrement and now be negative. The conference would remain,
	  but be put into an inactive state. The solution was to move from
	  the active list to the wait list, those users with wait_marked
	  set right before kicking. This allows both the active and wait
	  users to decrement correctly and the confbridge to tear down
	  properly. A crashed also occurred when trying to list the
	  specific conference from the CLI. This happened because the
	  conference specified was invalid. Since the conference properly
	  tears down now there is no way to reference it thus alleviating

	* res/res_pjsip_logger.c, res/res_rtp_asterisk.c,
	  res/res_pjsip_log_forwarder.c (added): res_pjsip: Forward PJSIP
	  logging to Asterisk logging This patch uses PJSIP's
	  pj_log_set_log_func() to forward PJSIP's log messages to
	  Asterisk's logger. This is done in a new module:
	  res_pjsip_log_forwarder.so. This patch sets defaultenabled on the
	  existing res_pjsip_logger.so to no, since logging every SIP
	  packet seems a bit odd to do by default, and is (hopefully) less
	  necessary with regular PJSIP logging. It also removes
	  res_rtp_asterisk's disabling of PJSIP logging. (closes issue

	* res/res_http_websocket.c: ARI: Fix WebSocket response when

	  without specifying the subprotocol if there's only one
	  subprotocol handler registered for the WebSocket. Naively, I
	  coded it to always respond with the subprotocol in use.
	  Unfortunately, according to RFC 6455, if the server's response
	  includes a subprotocol header field that "indicates the use of a
	  subprotocol that was not present in the client's handshake [...],
	  the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.", emphasis
	  theirs. This patch correctly omits the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol if
	  one is not specified by the client. (closes issue ASTERISK-22441)

	* main/core_unreal.c: core_local: Fix memory corruption race
	  condition. The masquerade super test is failing on v12 with high
	  fence violations and crashing. The fence violations are showing
	  that party id allocated memory strings are somehow getting
	  corrupted in the bridge_reconfigured_connected_line_update()
	  function. The invalid string values happen to be the freed memory
	  fill pattern. After much puzzling, I deduced that the
	  bridge_reconfigured_connected_line_update() is copying a string
	  out of the source channel's caller party id struct just as
	  another thread is updating it with a new value. The copying
	  thread is using the old string pointer being freed by the
	  updating thread. A search of the code found the
	  unreal_colp_redirect_indicate() routine updating the caller party
	  id's without holding the channel lock. A latent bug in v1.8 and
	  v11 hatched in v12 because of the bridging and connected line

	* main/lock.c, /, main/utils.c, include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix
	  DEBUG_THREADS when lock is acquired in __constructor__ This patch
	  fixes some long-standing bugs in debug threads that were
	  exacerbated with recent Optional API work in Asterisk 12. With
	  debug threads enabled, on some systems, there's a lock ordering
	  problem between our mutex and glibc's mutex protecting its module
	  list (Ubuntu Lucid, glibc 2.11.1 in this instance). In one
	  thread, the module list will be locked before acquiring our
	  mutex. In another thread, our mutex will be locked before locking
	  the module list (which happens in the depths of calling
	  backtrace()). This patch fixes this issue by moving backtrace()
	  calls outside of critical sections that have the mutex acquired.
	  The bigger change was to reentrancy tracking for
	  ast_cond_{timed,}wait, which wrongly assumed that waiting on the
	  mutex was equivalent to a single unlock (it actually suspends all
	  recursive locks on the mutex). (closes issue ASTERISK-22455)

	* /, res/res_xmpp.c: Prevent XMPP timeout on blank responses
	  Sometimes the Google Voice servers have a bad habit of sending
	  out 1 byte replies to the xmpp resource. When a blank 1 byte
	  reply is received from the socket the buffer attempts to wait
	  (endlessly) for the rest of the reply from google which
	  effectively blocks the socket and google voice calls will no
	  longer come into the server. This patch allows the xmpp module to
	  correctly detect empty packets and send out ping replies to
	  google. It also sets a socket timeout on the default socket which
	  prevents the xmpp socket from closing and preventing future
	  google voice calls from coming into the server. Furthermore
	  instead of sending an empty reply back to google we send a proper
	  xmpp ping reply back. This also adds several more socket
	  messages. (closes issue ASTERISK-22347) Reported by: Andrew Nagy

	  linking problems between modules that export global symbols With
	  the new work in Asterisk 12, there are some uses of the
	  optional_api that are prone to failure. The details are rather
	  involved, and captured on [the wiki][1]. This patch addresses the
	  issue by removing almost all of the magic from the optional API
	  implementation. Instead of relying on weak symbol resolution, a
	  new optional_api.c module was added to Asterisk core. For modules
	  providing an optional API, the pointer to the implementation
	  function is registered with the core. For modules that use an
	  optional API, a pointer to a stub function, along with a
	  optional_ref function pointer are registered with the core. The
	  optional_ref function pointers is set to the implementation
	  function when it's provided, or the stub function when it's now.
	  Since the implementation no longer relies on magic, it is now
	  supported on all platforms. In the spirit of choice, an
	  OPTIONAL_API flag was added, so we can disable the optional_api
	  if needed (maybe it's buggy on some bizarre platform I haven't
	  tested on) The AST_OPTIONAL_API*() macros themselves remained
	  unchanged, so existing code could remain unchanged. But to help
	  with debugging the optional_api, the patch limits the #include of
	  optional API's to just the modules using the API. This also
	  reduces resource waste maintaining optional_ref pointers that
	  aren't used. Other changes made as a part of this patch: * The
	  stubs for http_websocket that wrap system calls set errno to
	  ENOSYS. * res_http_websocket now properly increments module use
	  count. * In loader.c, the while() wrappers around dlclose() were
	  removed. The while(!dlclose()) is actually an anti-pattern, which
	  can lead to infinite loops if the module you're attempting to
	  unload exports a symbol that was directly linked to. * The
	  special handling of nonoptreq on systems without weak symbol
	  support was removed, since we no longer rely on weak symbols for
	  optional_api. [1]: https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/x/wACUAQ

	  deleting a recording, it was simple enough to implement the GET
	  for all recordings, and for an individual recording. The
	  recording playback operation was modified to use the same code
	  for accessing the recording as the REST API, so that they will
	  behave consistently. There were several problems with the
	  api-docs that were also fixed, bringing the ARI spec in line with
	  the implementation. There were some 'wishful thinking' fields on
	  the stored recording model (duration and timestamp) that were
	  removed, because I ended up not implementing a metadata file to
	  go along with the recording to store such information. The GET
	  /recordings/live operation was removed, since it's not really
	  that useful to get a list of all recordings that are currently
	  going on in the system. (At least, if we did that, we'd probably
	  want to also list all of the current playbacks. Which seems
	  weird.) (closes issue ASTERISK-21582) Review:

	* res/res_pjsip_pidf.c: Sanitize XML output for PIDF bodies.
	  PJSIP's PIDF API does not replace angle brackets with their

	* res/res_pjsip_session.c: Fix a race condition where a canceled
	  call was answered. RFC 5407 section 3.1.2 details a scenario
	  where a UAC sends a CANCEL at the same time that a UAS sends a
	  200 OK for the INVITE that the UAC is canceling. When this
	  occurs, it is the role of the UAC to immediately send a BYE to
	  terminate the call. This scenario was reproducible by have a
	  Digium phone with two lines place a call to a second phone that
	  forwarded the call to the second line on the original phone. The
	  Digium phone, upon realizing that it was connecting to itself,
	  would attempt to cancel the call. The timing of this happened to
	  trigger the aforementioned race condition about 80% of the time.
	  Asterisk was not doing its job of sending a BYE when receiving a
	  200 OK on a cancelled INVITE. The result was that the ast_channel
	  structure was destroyed but the underlying SIP session, as well
	  as the PJSIP inv_session and dialog, were still alive. Attempting
	  to perform an action such as a transfer, once in this state,
	  would result in Asterisk crashing. The circumstances are now
	  detected properly and the session is ended as recommended in RFC
	  5407. (closes issue AST-1209) reported by John Bigelow

	* res/res_pjsip_refer.c: Improve detection of answer on SIP blind
	  transfer. A problem encountered during testing was that
	  res_pjsip_refer would not ever send a NOTIFY with a 200 OK
	  sipfrag. This is because the framehook that was supposed to send
	  the NOTIFY would never be told that an answer had occurred. This
	  happened for two reasons: 1) The transferee channel on which the
	  framehook was on was already up. 2) Answers are rarely if ever
	  written to channels. Rather, the ast_answer() or ast_raw_answer()
	  function is used to answer channels. Thanks to a suggestion by
	  Matt Jordan, the best way to detect that the call had been
	  answered was to find out when the transferee channel joined a
	  bridge. With stasis this is an easy task. So now, in addition to
	  the framehook logic, there is a stasis subscription used to
	  determine when the transferee has entered a bridge. Once it has
	  entered, an appropriate NOTIFY is sent.

	  with the proper schema, alembic can do a database migration to
	  assist with upgrading Asterisk in the future. Hopefully this
	  helps make setting up and operating Asterisk with a database
	  easier. With this the schema only needs to be maintained in one
	  place instead of once per database. The schemas I have added here
	  have a bit of improvement over the examples that were there
	  before (some added consistency and added some missing indexes).
	  Managing the schema in one place here also applies to all

	* res/res_pjsip/pjsip_distributor.c: Fix dialog matching in the SIP
	  distributor. Dialog matching is performed in the distributor for
	  the sole purpose of retrieving an associated serializer so the
	  request may be serialized. This patch fixes two problems. First,
	  incoming CANCEL requests that had no to-tag (which really should
	  be *all* CANCEL requests) would not match with a dialog. An
	  earlier bug fix to deal with early CANCEL requests would result
	  in the CANCEL being replied to with a 481. The fix for this is to
	  find the matching INVITE transaction and get the dialog from that
	  transaction. Second, no SIP responses were matching dialogs. This
	  is because we were inverting the tags that we were passing into
	  PJSIP's dialog finding function. This logic has been corrected by
	  setting local and remote tag variables based on whether the
	  incoming message is a request or response.

	  rest-api-templates/param_parsing.mustache: ARI: WebSocket event
	  cleanup Stasis events (which get distributed over the ARI
	  WebSocket) are created by subscribing to the channel_all_cached
	  and bridge_all_cached topics, filtering out events for
	  channels/bridges currently subscribed to. There are two issues
	  with that. First was a race condition, where messages in-flight
	  to the master subscribe-to-all-things topic would get sent out,
	  even though the events happened before the channel was put into
	  Stasis. Secondly, as the number of channels and bridges grow in
	  the system, the work spent filtering messages becomes excessive.
	  Since r395954, individual channels and bridges have caching
	  topics, and can be subscribed to individually. This patch takes
	  advantage, so that channels and bridges are subscribed to on
	  demand, instead of filtering the global topics. The one case
	  where filtering is still required is handling BridgeMerge
	  messages, which are published directly to the bridge_all topic.
	  Other than the change to how subscriptions work, this patch
	  mostly just moves code around. Most of the work generating JSON
	  objects from messages was moved to .to_json handlers on the
	  message types. The callback functions handling app subscriptions
	  were moved from res_stasis (b/c they were global to the model) to
	  stasis/app.c (b/c they are local to the app now). (closes issue

	* main/bridge_channel.c: Better handle clearing the OUTGOING flag
	  when a channel leaves a bridge When a channel with the OUTGOING
	  flag leaves a bridge, and it will survive being pulled from the
	  bridge (either because it will execute dialplan, go into another
	  bridge, or live in a friendly autoloop), we have to clear the
	  OUTGOING flag. This is the signal to the CDR engine that this
	  channel is no longer a second class citizen, i.e., it is not
	  "dialed". The soft hangup flags are only half the picture. If a
	  channel is being moved from one bridge to another, the soft
	  hangup flags aren't set; however, the state of the bridge_channel
	  will not be hung up. Since the channel does not have one of the
	  two hang up states, that implies that the channel is still
	  technically alive. This patch modifies the check so that it
	  checks both the soft hangup flags as well as the bridge_channel
	  state. If either suggests that the channel is going to persist,
	  we clear the OUTGOING flag.

	  framework/sorcery with types/options without documentation There
	  are times when a configuration option should not have
	  documentation. 1. Some options are registered with a particular
	  object merely as a warning to users. These options aren't even
	  really 'deprecated' - which has its own separate API call - they
	  are actually provided by a different configuration file. The
	  options are merely registered so that the user gets a warning
	  that a different configuration file provides the item. 2. Some
	  object types - most notably some used by modules that use sorcery
	  - are completely internal and should never be shown to the user.
	  3. Sorcery itself has several 'hidden' fields that should never
	  be shown to a user. This patch updates the configuration
	  framework and sorcery with additional API calls that allow a
	  module to register types as internal and options as not requiring
	  documentation. This bypasses the XML documentation checking. This
	  patch also re-enables the strict XML documentation checking in
	  trunk, as well as updates some documentation that was missing.

	  This became apparent first after r376428 (Reorder startup

	  Writing to stderr triggered a SIGBUS. (Compared to x86 and amd64

	  to the topic dtor to catch extra ref decrements. * Fixed type
	  used after destruction errors for graceful shutdown in

	  happen while bridged This patch changes ARI bridging to allow
	  other channel operations to happen while the channel is bridged.
	  ARI channel operations are designed to queue up and execute
	  sequentially. This meant, though, that while a channel was
	  bridged, any other channel operations would queue up and execute
	  only after the channel left the bridge. This patch changes ARI
	  bridging so that channel commands can execute while the channel
	  is bridged. For most operations, things simply work as expected.
	  The one thing that ended up being a bit odd is recording. The
	  current recording implementation will fail when one attempts to
	  record a channel that's in a bridge. Note that the bridge itself
	  may be recording; it's recording a specific channel in the bridge
	  that fails. While this is an annoying limitation, channel
	  recording is still very useful for use cases such as voice mail,
	  and bridge recording makes up much of the difference for other
	  use cases. (closes issue ASTERISK-22084) Review:

	* main/bridge_channel.c, main/bridge.c, main/features.c: Fix two
	  race conditions and ref counting issue when joining a bridge
	  These problems were all caught by a test in the Asterisk Test
	  Suite that originated some Local channels and attempted to move
	  the ;2 half of the Local channel into a bridge using the Bridge
	  AMI action. (1) When originating a channel, the Newchannel event
	  is emitted quickly; however, the ;2 channel will not have a pbx
	  thread assigned to it until after the outbound 'dialing' for the
	  ;1 is complete. Thus, there is a period of time where the outside
	  world "knows" of the channel's existence and can influence it but
	  Asterisk has not yet started the dialplan execution thread. If a
	  Bridge AMI action is taken on the channel, the channel appears to
	  be a Dialed channel with no PBX thread; hence, the channel will
	  be imparted into the Bridge by first 'yanking' the channel. At
	  the same time, a race condition can occur after the yank (but
	  before entering the bridge) when ;1 answers and starts a PBX on
	  the ;2. The end result currently is an assertion failure in the
	  Bridging API, as a channel with a PBX is imparted into the
	  Bridge. There's no way to prevent AMI from attempting to Bridge a
	  channel immediately after creation; likewise, holding the channel
	  lock through the entire Dial operation is unwise (and
	  impossible). Instead of treating the presence of a PBX thread as
	  an error, we simply bail out of the adding the channel to the
	  bridge through ast_bridge_impart. The Bridge action will then
	  fail - but we avoid a situation where the channel is both
	  executing a PBX thread and simultaneously being given a separate
	  thread in the bridging system (which would be a "bad thing").
	  Since imparting a channel with a PBX *can* occur and is not a
	  programming error, the asserts have been removed. (2) When the
	  first condition occurs, we have to take one of two actions:
	  either hangup the yanked channel as it did not enter the bridge,
	  or deref it because we don't own it. We can determine if we own
	  it or not by testing for the presence of the PBX thread. If we
	  hung it up directly, we'd crash. (3) bridge_find_channel does not
	  increase the reference count of the ast_bridge_channel object.
	  The RAII_VAR usage in ast_bridge_add_channel thus created a
	  ticking time bomb in whatever bridge the channel moved into, as
	  the destructor for the ast_bridge_channel object would be called.

	  to use the stdio buffering setup in ast_writefile. It also

	  main/cel.c: Hide the Surrogate channels from external consumers;
	  kill Masquerade events This patch does three things: 1. It
	  provides a Surrogate channel technology with a consolidated
	  "implementation detail flag" on the channel technology. This
	  tells consumers of Stasis that the creation of this channel is an
	  implementation detail in Asterisk and can be ignored (if they so
	  choose). This consolidates the conference recorder/announcer
	  flags as well - these flags had no additional meaning beyond
	  "ignore this channel please". 2. It modifies allocation of a
	  channel in two ways: (a) If a channel technology can be
	  determined from the name, we set it directly in the allocation
	  routine. This prevents the initial publication of the message
	  from going out with a NULL channel technology where possible.
	  This lets Stasis consumers get the right channel technology on
	  the first publication. (b) It reorganizes allocation to make use
	  of the 'finalized' property on the channel. This was already used
	  to know that a channel had completely finished its construction
	  in the masquerade routine; now we also use it to know whether or
	  not the setting of certain channel properties is occurring during
	  or post construction. The various set routines were modified
	  accordingly as well. 3. The masquerade event is now dead, Jim. It
	  no longer served any purpose whatsoever - if you perform a call
	  pickup you'll get a Pickup event; if you perform an attended
	  transfer you will still get those events; if you steal a channel
	  to put it elsewhere you'll get the corresponding NewExten or
	  BridgeEnter events. Review:

	  option; however, it also means that when backtraces are disposed
	  of they have to be done so outside of the re-defined free. This
	  patch undef's free prior to disposing of the allocated backtrace
	  when a backtrace is appended as a result of 'core show locks'.

	  This patch fixes that by changing how caching topics forward
	  messages, and how the caching pattern forwards are setup. For the
	  caching pattern, the all_topic is forwarded to the
	  all_topic_cached. This forwards messages published directly to
	  the all_topic to all_topic_cached. In order to avoid duplicate
	  messages on all_topic_cached, caching topics were changed to no
	  longer forward uncached messages. Subscribers to an individual
	  caching topic should only expect to receive cache updates, and
	  subscription change messages. Since individual caching topics are
	  new, this shouldn't be a problem. There are a few minor changes
	  to the pre-cache split behavior. * For topics changed to use the
	  caching pattern, the all_topic_cached will forward snapshots in
	  addition to cache updates. Since subscribers by design ignore
	  unexpected messages, this should be fine. * Caching topics that
	  don't use the caching pattern no longer forward non-cache
	  updates. This makes no difference for the current caching topics.

	* bridges/bridge_holding.c: bridge_holding: Add suspsend/unsuspend
	  callbacks Suspend and unsuspend callbacks are added to the
	  holding bridge so that entertainment can be disabled and
	  re-enabled when operations would suspend a channel on the bridge
	  (such as playback operations). This fixes entertainment so that
	  when those operations end, the entertainment can pick back up and
	  it also serves as an optimization. Also, this patch fixes a bug
	  caused by triggering ringing frames immediately instead of
	  pushing them to the queue which created a race condition where
	  sometimes parking with ringing during attended transfers would
	  cause the ringing to be interrupted by an unhold frame. (closes

	  chan_dahdi/sig_analog and chan_mgcp. * A parking bridge features
	  virtual table has been added that provides access to the parking
	  functionality that the Bridging API needs. This includes requests
	  to park an entire 'call' (with little or no additional
	  information, thank you chan_skinny), perform a blind transfer to
	  a parking extension, determine if an extension is a parking
	  extension, as well as the actual "do the parking" request from
	  the Bridging API. * Refactoring in chan_mgcp, chan_skinny, and
	  chan_dahdi to make use of the new functions * The removal of some
	  - but not all - dead parking code from features.c This also fixed
	  blind transferring a multi-party bridge to a parking lot (which

	  from the stasis_caching_topic. In working with res_stasis, I
	  discovered a significant limitation to the current structure of
	  stasis_caching_topics: you cannot subscribe to cache updates for
	  a single channel/bridge/endpoint/etc. To address this, this patch
	  splits the cache away from the stasis_caching_topic, making it a
	  first class object. The stasis_cache object is shared amongst
	  individual stasis_caching_topics that are created per
	  channel/endpoint/etc. These are still forwarded to global
	  whatever_all_cached topics, so their use from most of the code
	  does not change. In making these changes, I noticed that we
	  frequently used a similar pattern for bridges, endpoints and
	  channels: single_topic ----------------> all_topic ^ |
	  single_topic_cached ----+----> all_topic_cached | +----> cache
	  This pattern was extracted as the 'Stasis Caching Pattern',
	  defined in stasis_caching_pattern.h. This avoids a lot of
	  duplicate code between the different domain objects. Since the
	  cache is now disassociated from its upstream caching topics, this
	  also necessitated a change to how the 'guaranteed' flag worked
	  for retrieving from a cache. The code for handling the caching
	  guarantee was extracted into a 'stasis_topic_wait' function,
	  which works for any stasis_topic. (closes issue ASTERISK-22002)

	  GULP->PJSIP renaming effort. The general gist is to have a clear
	  boundary between old SIP stuff and new SIP stuff by having the
	  word "SIP" for old stuff and "PJSIP" for new stuff. Here's a
	  brief rundown of the changes: * The word "Gulp" in dialstrings,
	  functions, and CLI commands is now "PJSIP" * chan_gulp.c is now
	  chan_pjsip.c * Function names in chan_gulp.c that were "gulp_*"
	  are now "chan_pjsip_*" * All files that were "res_sip*" are now
	  "res_pjsip*" * The "res_sip" directory is now "res_pjsip" * Files
	  in the "res_pjsip" directory that began with "sip_*" are now
	  "pjsip_*" * The configuration file is now "pjsip.conf" instead of
	  "res_sip.conf" * The module info for all PJSIP-related files now
	  uses "PJSIP" instead of "SIP" * CLI and AMI commands created by
	  Asterisk's PJSIP modules now have "pjsip" as the starting word
	  instead of "sip"

	* res/res_sip_session.c: Fix crash due to trying to send a
	  re-invite while in the incorrect state. This crash would occur if
	  a re-invite was queued while the initial INVITE transaction was
	  still occurring and the response to the INVITE was not ACKed.
	  This lack of ACK would cause the INVITE session state to never
	  reach confirmed. Once the transaction terminated, however, the
	  queued re-invite would occur and cause a crash due to this lack
	  of state change. This fix checks the INVITE session state before
	  performing the re-invite to ensure it is in the required

	* main/channel.c: Kill the zombies In previous versions of

	  They ravaged Asterisk systems with their biting and their nashing
	  and their pointy teeth. Sometimes, you couldn't even hang them
	  up. Now, zombies are rare. They still *technically* exist in
	  certain places, but they are controlled. Kind of like a zombie
	  zoo: you can see them, but you can't touch them, and they can't
	  touch you. Bring your kids! Because zombies are now population
	  controlled with a very short lifespan, there's no reason to
	  rename the channels to '%s<ZOMBIE>'. The channels are guaranteed
	  to die off quickly; the rename really is just confusing at this
	  point. This patch finally removes the renaming. On the plus side:
	  this made my life easier in CDRs during call pickup and attended
	  transfers to an Asterisk application. It will make other folks

	* res/stasis/app.h, res/res_stasis.c, res/stasis/app.c: Continue

	  in the /ari/events WebSocket in handling reconnects. When a

	  reconnected, it would not receive events for any channels or
	  bridges it was subscribed to. The fix was to lazily clean up
	  Stasis application registrations, instead of removing them as
	  soon as the WebSocket goes away. When an application is
	  unregistered at the WebSocket level, the underlying application
	  is simply deactivated. If the application WebSocket is
	  reconnected, the application is reactivated for the new
	  connection. To avoid memory leaks from lingering, unused

	  ordering issues The stasis_cache_update messages are somewhat

	  with the same route. Since caching itself is a first class
	  component of stasis-core, it makes sense for the router to handle
	  the cache update messages itself. This patch adds
	  stasis_message_router_add_cache_update() and
	  stasis_message_router_remove_cache_update() to handle the routing
	  of stasis_cache_update messages. This patch also corrects an
	  issue with manager_{bridging,channels}.c, where events might be
	  reordered. The reordering occurs because the components use
	  different message routers, which they needed because they both
	  needed to route cache update messages. They now both use
	  manager's router, and add cache routes for just the cache updates
	  they are interested in. (closes issue ASTERISK-22038) Review:

	  from impacting local modifications, a new config file -
	  safe_asterisk.conf.sample - has been provided. Settings that were
	  previously modified in safe_asterisk can be set there instead.

	  headers and overwriting the previously parsed "Cookie" header.
	  Note that we probably should be appending the cookies in each
	  "Cookie" header to the parsed results; however, while clients can
	  send multiple cookie headers they never really do. While this
	  patch doesn't improve Asterisk's behavior in that regard, it
	  shouldn't make it any worse either. Note that the solution in

	* main/stasis_cache.c: Fix caching topic shutdown assertions The
	  recent changes to update stasis_cache_topics directly from the
	  publisher thread uncovered a race condition, which was causing
	  asserts in the /stasis/core tests. If the caching topic's
	  subscription is the last reference to the caching topic, it will
	  destroy the caching topic after the final message has been
	  processed. When dispatching to a different thread, this usually
	  gave the unsubscribe enough time to finish before destruction
	  happened. Now, however, it consistently destroys before
	  unsubscription is complete. This patch adds an extra reference to
	  the caching topic, to hold it for the duration of the
	  unsubscription. This patch also removes an extra unref that was
	  happening when the final message was received by the caching
	  topic. It was put there because of an extra ref that was put into
	  the caching topic's constructor. Both have been removed, which
	  makes the destructor a bit less confusing. Review:

	  D-Channel When a DAHDI device is removed at run-time it sends the

	  signal the userspace program to close the respective file handle,
	  as the driver of the device will need all of them closed to
	  properly clean-up. This event has long since been handled in
	  chan_dahdi (chan_zap at the time). However the event that is sent
	  on a D-Channel of a "PRI" (ISDN) span simply gets ignored. This
	  commit adds handling for closing the file descriptor (and
	  shutting down the span, while we're at it). It also adds a CLI
	  command 'pri destroy span <N>' to destroy the span and its DAHDI

	* main/bridging.c, main/cdr.c: Fix FRACK message from external
	  redirects; handle outbound channels better This patch does the
	  following: * It simplifies the Dial handling in CDRs. As a rule,
	  the caller in a dial relationship is always the Party A. There
	  was some logic present in the handling of the dial message that
	  could, conceivably, pick the caller as Party A for the beginning
	  of the dial and the peer as Party A for the end of the dial. This
	  shouldn't have happened if the code in the bridging framework was
	  doing its job; however, that was broken and it led to the FRACK.
	  As it is, this code was overly ocmplex and not needed: the
	  caller, if present, should always be Party A. Period. * It
	  properly checks to see if a channel will continue on in the
	  dialplan. ast_check_hangup - much like cake at the end - is a
	  lie. It will tell you that you are hungup when you are not. Do
	  not believe it. I would make this function tell the truth, but
	  I'm nervous that we've been depending on it sitting on its throne
	  of lies for far too long, and it would probably break lots of
	  things. So I'm just checking the "internal" soft hangup flags,

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c, /: Fix a longstanding issue with MFC-R2
	  configuration that prevented users from mixing different variants
	  or general MFC-R2 settings within the same E1 line. Most users do
	  not have a problem with this since MFC-R2 lines are usually
	  fractional E1s, or the whole E1 has the same country variant and
	  R2 settings. In Venezuela however is common to have inbound
	  MFC-R2 and outbound DTMF-R2 within the same E1. This fix now
	  properly parses the chan_dahdi.conf file to generate a new openr2
	  context every time a new channel => section is found and the
	  configuration was changed. (closes issue ASTERISK-21117) Reported

	* tests/test_json.c: Fixed intermittent crash when loading
	  test_json.so The JSON test attempted an overly clever use of
	  RAII_VAR to run code at the beginning and end of each test, in
	  order to validate that no JSON objects were leaked during the
	  test. The problem is that the validation code would run during
	  the initial load, when the tests were initialized. This happens
	  during startup, when other parts of the system might actively be
	  allocating and freeing JSON objects. This patch changes the
	  RAII_VAR to use the new ast_test_register_{init,cleanup}
	  functions to run the validations properly. (closes issue

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Refactor and cleanup of skinny session
	  handling. Major changes are to pull all packet reading functions
	  into skinny_session and move timeout handling to scheduling
	  arrangements. Thread cancelling is now undertaken directly rather
	  than waiting for the read to timeout (cleanup is popped on thread
	  cancel). Also added some keepalive timings in debugging messages.
	  Keepalive timeout has been increased from 1.1 by keepalive to 3
	  times keepalive. This seems to align (after keepalives stabilise)
	  with when devices reset after not receiving keepalives. Probably
	  needs more work, especially around the first and/or second
	  keepalives that vary significantly by device and firmware

	* tests/test_cel.c: Correct test_cel cleanup. When I corrected the
	  CEL test crash in r394037, I didn't quite pay attention to how
	  the globals and locals were being shuffled around in the cleanup
	  callback. I removed the nulling of the global variables, which
	  caused them to be double cleaned. This patch puts the global
	  nulling code back (since the vars are cleaned up by RAII_VARs),
	  and removes the explicit ao2_cleanup() (since they were no-ops,
	  because the variables had just been nulled).

	* res/stasis_http/config.c, configs/ari.conf.sample,
	  res/res_stasis_http.c: Change ARI user config to use a type field
	  When I initially wrote the configuration support for ARI users, I
	  determined the section type by a category prefix (i.e.,
	  [user-admin]). This is neither idiomatic Asterisk configuration,
	  nor is it really that user friendly. This patch replaces the
	  category prefix with a type field in the section, which is much
	  cleaner. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2664/

	* tests/test_voicemail_api.c: test_voicemail_api: fix warning found
	  by gcc-4.8 The voicemail_api test had code like strncmp(a, b,
	  sizeof(a)), but a was a char pointer, instead of a literal or
	  char array. This meant that sizeof was the size of the pointer,
	  not the length of the string. Since the string is in a
	  stringfield and should be null terminated, I just changed it to a
	  plain strcmp.

	  supporting files should be executable against python version 2.5.
	  An OrderedDict class (backported from a newer version of python)
	  is included. A MultiOrderedDict class is implemented so options,
	  when added, should be able to be added in order and allowed to
	  have multiple values. Currently the scripts supports the majority
	  of endpoint options found in res_sip.conf. Support has also been
	  added for Aor(s) and the ACL/security sections. Inside the
	  sip_to_res_sip.py file one can see a list of options that still
	  need to be mapped. Also items that still need to be done:
	  templates, includes, parsing '=>' delimiter. Note that some code
	  is hopefully in place already to support templates (e.g.
	  lookup/retrieving defaults from them). However, the parsing of
	  and adding of the section needs to be done.

	* configs/sla.conf.sample, /, apps/app_meetme.c: astobj2-ify the
	  SLA code The SLA code within app_meetme was written before
	  asotbj2 had been merged into Asterisk. Worse, support for reloads
	  did not exist at first and was added later as a bolt-on feature.
	  I knew at the time that reloading was not safe at all while SLA
	  was in use, so the reload would be queued up to execute when the
	  system was idle. Unfortunately, this approach was still prone to
	  errors beyond the fact that this was the only place in Asterisk
	  where configuration was not reloaded instantly when requested.
	  This patch converts various SLA objects to be reference counted
	  objects using astobj2. This allows reloads to be processed while
	  the system is in use. The code ensures that the objects will not
	  disappear while one of the other threads is using them. However,
	  they will be immediately removed from the global trunk and
	  station containers so no new calls will use them if removed from
	  configuration. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2581/

	  following: * It adds a virtual table of callbacks to core_unreal.
	  These callbacks can be supplied by concrete implementations of
	  "unreal" channel drivers, which lets the unreal channel driver
	  call specific functionality when it performs some action.
	  Currently, this is done to notify implementations when an
	  optimization operation has begun, and when an optimization
	  operation has succeeded. * It adds Stasis-Core messages for Local
	  channel bridging and Local channel optimization. Local channel
	  optimization is now two events: a Begin and an End. Some
	  consumers of Stasis-Core may want to know when an operation is
	  beginning so that they can 'prepare' their information; others
	  will be more concerned about when the operation has completed, so
	  that they can 'fix up' information. Stasis-Core allows for both,

	  main/manager_channels.c: Handle hangup logic in the Stasis
	  message bus and consumers of Stasis messages This patch does the
	  following: * It adds a new soft hangup flag
	  AST_SOFTHANGUP_HANGUP_EXEC that is set when a channel is
	  executing dialplan hangup logic, i.e., the 'h' extension or a
	  hangup handler. Stasis messages now also convey the soft hangup
	  flag so consumers of the messages can know when a channel is
	  executing said hangup logic. * It adds a new channel flag,
	  AST_FLAG_DEAD, which is set when a channel is well and truly
	  dead. Not just a zombie, but dead, Jim. Manager, CEL, CDRs, and
	  other consumers of Stasis have been updated to look for this flag
	  to know when the channel should by lying six feet under. * The
	  CDR engine has been updated to better handle a channel entering
	  and leaving a bridge. Previously, a new CDR was automatically
	  created when a channel left a bridge and put into the 'Pending'
	  state; however, this way of handling CDRs made it difficult for
	  the 'endbeforehexten' logic to work correctly - there was always
	  a new CDR waiting in the hangup logic and, even if 'ended',
	  wouldn't be the CDR people wanted to inspect in the hangup
	  routine. This patch completely removes the Pending state and
	  instead defers creation of the new CDR until it gets a new
	  message that requires a new CDR.

	  main/rtp_engine.c, channels/chan_sip.c: Refactor RTCP events over
	  to Stasis; associate with channels This patch does the following:
	  * It merges Jaco Kroon's patch from ASTERISK-20754, which
	  provides channel information in the RTCP events. Because Stasis
	  provides a cache, Jaco's patch was modified to pass the channel
	  uniqueid to the RTP layer as opposed to a pointer to the channel.
	  This has the following benefits: (1) It keeps the RTP engine
	  'clean' of references back to channels (2) It prevents circular
	  dependencies and other potential ref counting issues * The RTP
	  engine now allows any RTP implementation to raise RTCP messages.
	  Potentially, other implementations (such as res_rtp_multicast)
	  could also raise RTCP information. The engine provides structs to
	  represent RTCP headers and RTCP SR/RR reports. * Some general
	  refactoring in res_rtp_asterisk was done to try and tame the RTCP
	  code. It isn't perfect - that's *way* beyond the scope of this
	  work - but it does feel marginally better. * A few random bugs
	  were fixed in the RTCP statistics. (Example: performing an
	  assignment of a = a is probably not correct) * We now raise RTCP
	  events for each SR/RR sent/received. Previously we wouldn't raise
	  an event when we sent a RR report. Note that this work will be of
	  use to others who want to monitor call quality or build modules
	  that report call quality statistics. Since the events are now
	  moving across the Stasis message bus, this is far easier to
	  accomplish. It is also a first step (though by no means the last
	  step) towards getting Olle's pinefrog work incorporated. Again:
	  note that the patch by Jaco Kroon was modified slightly for this
	  work; however, he did all of the hard work in finding the right
	  places to set the channel in the RTP engine across the channel
	  drivers. Much thanks goes to Jaco for his hard work here. Review:

	  large amount of rework regarding how to redial the Parker when a
	  channel leaves a parking lot due to timeout. An attended transfer
	  channel variable has been added to attended transfers to
	  extensions that will eventually park (but haven't at the time of
	  transfer) as well. This resolves one of the two BUGBUG comments

	* bridges/bridge_builtin_features.c,
	  include/asterisk/bridging_features.h: OneTouchRecord: Make so
	  Monitor/MixMonitor can be toggled/started/stopped. The
	  OneTouchRecord feature has historically been a toggle. This patch
	  adds the ability to make the OneTouchRecord hook optionally
	  start/stop recording only. If OneTouchRecord is already doing
	  what is requested then only the invoker hears the courtesy tone
	  and/or start/stop recording message. The new feature is written
	  so we could easily add explicit start/stop recording DTMF hooks
	  for Monitor and MixMonitor. The majority of the changes in
	  bridge_builtin_features.c is a refactoring of the OneTouchRecord
	  code (Monitor and MixMonitor versions) so it is easy to direct
	  the toggle/start/stop functionality. Review:

	* main/cdr.c: Fix some bugs in CDRs; add some CLI commands to help
	  debugging This patch fixes a few minor bugs and one major one:
	  the CDR by bridge container was less than helpful. The mechanism
	  previously used to try and find all of the CDRs in a particular
	  bridge ended up missing CDRs, resulting in incorrect records.
	  When looking up CDRs in a bridge, we now just bite the bullet and
	  do a selection across all existing CDRs.

	* main/stasis_config.c: Let Stasis load itself with default values
	  While a Stasis configuration file is nice, it shouldn't be
	  mandatory. We can carry on with default values.

	* main/bridging.c: Publish a bridge enter before pulling on a
	  push-and-swap operation. Prior to this patch, the order of
	  procedures on a bridge push was * Add new bridge channel to
	  bridge's array. * Pull the swap channel out of the bridge *
	  Publish a bridge enter event. The problem is that when the swap
	  channel was pulled from the bridge, a bridge leave event would be
	  published. The bridge snapshot published during the bridge leave
	  showed the new channel that had been added to the bridge, but
	  there had been no bridge enter event for that channel. The fix
	  provided here was to change the order a bit * Add new bridge
	  channel to bridge's array. * Publish bridge enter event. * Pull
	  the swap channel out of the bridge. This makes it so that the
	  bridge snapshots during the stasis events are accurate.

	* include/asterisk/pbx.h, main/pbx.c, main/manager.c: Prevent crash
	  during synchronous AMI origination by ref bumping returned
	  channel The originate APIs allow callers to provide a pointer to
	  a channel that will point to the originated channel if the
	  function call succeeds. This is used by AMI to provide channel
	  information when the originate is performed synchronously.
	  Unfortunately, if the originate fails in certain ways, the
	  outbound channel is already disposed of during the dialing
	  itself. This results in the channel being improperly dereferenced
	  by the internal originate function in pbx.c. This patch ref bumps
	  the channel to prevent this from occurring. Callers must now
	  unlock and unref the channel (which is more in line with general
	  channel management guidelines anyway). This only affects manager,
	  as it is the only consumer of this API function that actually
	  passes in a channel pointer. Review:

	* tests/test_cdr.c, main/cdr.c: Handle an originated channel being
	  sent into a non-empty bridge Originated channels are a bit odd -
	  they are technically a dialed channel (thus the party B or peer)
	  but, since there is no caller, they are treated as the party A.
	  When entering into a bridge that already contains participants,
	  the CDR engine - if the CDR record is in the Dial state -
	  attempts to match the person entering the bridge with an existing
	  participant. The idea is that if you dialed someone and the
	  person you dialed is already in the bridge, you don't need a new
	  CDR record, the existing CDR record describes the relationship.
	  Unfortunately, for an originated channel, there is no Party B. If
	  no one was in the bridge this didn't cause any issues; however,
	  if participants were in the bridge the CDR engine would attempt
	  to match a non-existant Party B on the channel's CDR record and
	  explode. This patch fixes that, and a unit test has been added to
	  cover this case.

	* include/asterisk/parking.h, main/asterisk.c, main/bridging.c,
	  main/cdr.c, include/asterisk/cdr.h: Better handle parking in CDRs
	  Parking typically occurs when a channel is transferred to a
	  parking extension. When this occurs, the channel never actually
	  hits the dialplan if the extension it was transferred to was a
	  "parking extension", that is, the extension in the first priority
	  calls the Park application. Instead, the channel is immediately
	  sent into the holding bridge acting as the parking bridge. This
	  is problematic. Because we never go out to the dialplan, the CDRs
	  won't transition properly and the application field will not be
	  set to "Park". CDRs typically swallow holding bridges, so the CDR
	  itself won't even be generated. This patch handles this by
	  pulling out the holding bridge handling into its own CDR state.
	  CDRs now have an explicit parking state that accounts for this
	  specific subclass of the holding bridge. In addition, we handle
	  the parking stasis message to set application specific data on
	  the CDR such that the last known application for the CDR properly
	  reflects "Park". This is a bit sad since we're working around the
	  odd internal implementation of parking that exists in Asterisk
	  (and that we had to maintain in order to continue to meet some
	  odd use cases of parking), but at least the code to handle that
	  is where it belongs: in CDRs as opposed to sprinkled liberally
	  throughout the codebase. This patch also properly clears the
	  OUTBOUND channel flag from a channel when it leaves a bridge, and
	  tweaks up dialing handling to properly compare the correct CDR
	  with the channel calling/being dialed.

	  Make sorcery details opaque and add extended fields. Sorcery
	  specific object information is now opaque and allocated with the

	  the sorcery specific part is changed. It also means that sorcery
	  can store additional information on objects and ensure it is

	  To facilitate the above a generic sorcery allocator function has
	  been added which also ensures that allocated objects do not have
	  a lock. Extended fields have been added thanks to all of the
	  above which allows specific fields to be marked as extended, and
	  thus simply stored as-is within the object. Type safety is *NOT*
	  enforced on these fields. A consumer of them has to query and
	  ultimately perform their own safety check. What does this mean?

	* res/res_fax.c: Fix a deadlock and possible crash in res_fax This
	  patch fixes two bugs. (1) It unlocks the channel in the framehook
	  handlers before attempting to grab the peer from the bridge. The
	  locking order for the bridging framework is bridge first, then
	  channel - having the channel locked while attempting to obtain
	  the bridge lock causes a locking inversion and a deadlock. This
	  patch bumps the channel ref count prior to releasing the lock in
	  the framehook to avoid lifetime issues. Note that this does
	  expose a subtle problem in framehooks; that is, something could
	  modify the framehook list while we are executing, causing issues
	  in the framehook list traversal that the callback executes in.
	  Fixing this is a much larger problem that is beyond the scope of
	  this patch - (a) we already unlock the channel in this particular
	  framehook and we haven't run into a problem yet (as modifying the
	  framehook list when a channel is about to perform a fax gateway
	  would be a very odd operation) and (b) migrating to an ao2
	  container of framehooks would be more invasive at this point. See
	  the referenced ASTERISK issue for more information. (2) Directly
	  packing channel variables into a JSON object turned out to be
	  unsafe. A condition existed where the strings in the JSON blob
	  were no longer safe to be accessed if the channel object itself
	  was disposed of. (issue ASTERISK-21951)

	* main/threadpool.c: Fix threadpool rapid growth problem. When a
	  threadpool is set to autoincrement its threadcount, an issue may
	  arise when multiple tasks are queued at once into the threadpool.
	  Since threads start active, each new task would result in
	  autoincrementing the thread count. So if all threads were active,
	  and a thread's autoincrement value were 5, then 3 new tasks would
	  result in 15 threads being created even though the initial
	  autoincrement was sufficient to handle the number of tasks. This
	  change introduces three behavior changes: 1) New threads in the
	  threadpool start idle instead of active. 2) When a threadpool
	  autoincrements, one thread is activated after the growth. 3) When
	  a threadpool's size is incremented manually, all added threads
	  are activated. For a more detailed explanation about the changes,
	  please see the Review Board link at the bottom of this commit.

	* funcs/func_cdr.c: Handle variable substitution in dummy variables
	  When func_cdr is used for variable substitution, there is no
	  channel name and hence no run-time information available for CDR

	  to use the CDR object on the channel passed to the function. This

	* funcs/func_cdr.c, main/cdr.c: Fix build warnings related to
	  printf/scanf of tv_usec. The type of tv_usec is suseconds_t. On
	  Linux, this is usually a long int, but the specification is
	  actually pretty lax on what it might actually be. And, sadly,
	  there's no printf/scanf width specifier for suseconds_t. So it
	  could bit an int or a long, but there's not a great way to tell
	  which it is. This patch fixes scanf by reading into a long
	  temporary variable that's then stored into the tv_usec. It fixes
	  printf by casting the tv_usec to a long first. This patch also
	  adds some missing width specifiers for some debug statements,
	  which would cause ".000001" to be displayed at ".1".

	* main/manager_channels.c: Prevent sending a NewExten event after a
	  Hangup during a stack restore When a channel is originated, its
	  application is typically set to AppDial2, indicating that it was
	  a dialed channel through the Dial API. Asterisk during an
	  originate will perform a stack execute to direct the outgoing
	  channel to a particular place in the dialplan or application.
	  When the stack returns, the previous application (AppDial2) is
	  restored. Unfortunately, in the case of an originated channel,
	  the stack restore happens after hangup. A stasis message is sent
	  notifying everyone that the application was restored, and this
	  causes a NewExten event to go out after the Hangup event,
	  violating the basic contract consumers have of the channel
	  lifetime. While we could preclude the message from going out,
	  restoring the channel's state before it executed the next higher
	  frame in the stack has to occur, and other places in the code
	  depend on this behavior. Since we know that channel hung up (it's
	  a ZOMBIE!), this patch simply checks to see if the channel has
	  been zombified before sending a NewExten event. Note that this
	  will fix a number of bouncing tests in the Test Suite. Go tests.

	* CHANGES: Restore bad merge on CHANGES The patch for CDRs moved
	  around a lot of content in CHANGES to try and organize the areas

	  CDRs for the new bridging framework This patch is the initial
	  push to update Asterisk's CDR engine for the new bridging
	  framework. This patch guts the existing CDR engine and builds the
	  new on top of messages coming across Stasis. As changes in
	  channel state and bridge state are detected, CDRs are built and
	  dispatched accordingly. This fundamentally changes CDRs in a few
	  ways. (1) CDRs are now *very* reflective of the actual state of
	  channels and bridges. This means CDRs track well with what an
	  actual channel is doing - which is useful in transfer scenarios
	  (which were previously difficult to pin down). It does, however,
	  mean that CDRs cannot be 'fooled'. Previous behavior in Asterisk
	  allowed for CDR applications, channels, and other properties to
	  be spoofed in parts of the code - this no longer works. (2) CDRs
	  have defined behavior in multi-party scenarios. This behavior
	  will not be what everyone wants, but it is a defined behavior and
	  as such, it is predictable. (3) The CDR manipulation functions
	  and applications have been overhauled. Major changes have been
	  made to ResetCDR and ForkCDR in particular. Many of the options
	  for these two applications no longer made any sense with the new
	  framework and the (slightly) more immutable nature of CDRs. There
	  are a plethora of other changes. For a full description of CDR
	  behavior, see the CDR specification on the Asterisk wiki. (closes

	* main/app.c: Fix regression in MWI stasis handling. In revision
	  389733, mwi state allocation was placed into its own function
	  instead of performing the allocation in-line when required. The
	  issue was that in ast_publish_mwi_state_full(), the local
	  variable "uniqueid" was no longer being set, but it was still
	  being used as the topic for MWI. This meant that all MWI
	  publications ended up being published to the "" (empty string)
	  mailbox topic. Thus MWI subscriptions for specific mailboxes were
	  never notified of mailbox state changes. This change fixes the
	  issue by removing the local uniqueid variable from
	  ast_publish_mwi_state_full() and instead referencing the
	  mwi_state->uniqueid field since it has been properly set. (closes

	  leak while loading modules, adding formats, and destroying

	  associated with entry in the list. This patch corrects that and
	  properly frees the memory for the module in the list. * When

	* main/stasis_channels.c, bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c: Fix memory
	  leaks in stasis_channels and bridge_native_rtp This patch fixes
	  two memory leaks: * A memory leak in packing channels into a
	  multi-channel blob payload when publishing dial messages. The
	  multi-channel blob payload does not steal the references - this
	  approach was chosen because it works well with the RAII_VAR
	  macro. Unfortunately, this does mean that you actually have to
	  use the RAII_VAR macro (or manually deref it yourself) * RTP
	  instances returned as a result of one of the glue operations are
	  ref counted and have to be de-ref'd appropriately. We now do
	  that, as saying that we should do it and then not would be silly.

	* bridges/bridge_native_rtp.c, include/asterisk/framehook.h,
	  main/framehook.c: bridge_native_rtp: Fix native bridge tech being

	  the native RTP bridge technology there is a race condition
	  between clearing framehooks that are destroyed when leaving
	  certain bridges with certain technologies (such as
	  bridge_native_rtp) and joining bridges with the bridge_native_rtp
	  technology. Yes, that means a channel in a native RTP bridge
	  could move to another native RTP bridge and be considered
	  incompatible with the new native RTP bridge causing it to revert
	  to a simple bridge technology0. This fixes that bug by ignoring
	  framehooks that have been marked for destruction when checking
	  for compatibility with the bridge_native_rtp technology.

	  wasn't local that it was remote. Meanwhile forbid can be returned
	  by that function which can mean certain glue pointers are NULL.
	  Then when the join/leave functions try to use members of that
	  pointer, boom. Segfault.

	* main/features_config.c: Temporary fix for people using sample
	  features.conf from previous Asterisk versions. People who use the
	  features.conf.sample file from Asterisk 11 and before in trunk
	  were given a rude awakening when features configuration changes
	  were made. Because it uses the config framework and the config
	  framework is strict about what is accepted and what isn't, people
	  that had parking options configured found that Asterisk no longer
	  started. This is because parking options are currently handled in
	  res_parking.conf instead of features.conf. This fix seeks to
	  create a temporary band-aid fix for the problem, but having
	  parking options from the general section be passed to a handler
	  that will simply print that the option is no longer supported.
	  This will not cause Asterisk to exit. The fix only applies to
	  options in the general section. There are two main reasons for
	  this: 1) The sample features.conf file only has parking options
	  in the general section. There are no configured parking lots.
	  Therefore it's not quite as "urgent" to get the parking lot
	  parsing fixed. 2) The plan is to move parking configuration back
	  from res_parking.conf to features.conf. When that happens, the
	  parking lots will also be addressed at that time.

	* apps/app_queue.c, /, configs/queues.conf.sample, UPGRADE.txt: Add
	  announce-to-first-user option for app_queue In r386792, the
	  ability to play prompts to the first caller in a call queue was
	  added. While this is arguably a bug fix for those who expect the
	  first caller to continue receiving prompts while the agent is
	  dialed, it has the side effect of preventing the first caller
	  from hearing the agent immediately upon bridging. This may not be
	  a problem for those who really want this option, but for those
	  who didn't care whether or not the first caller in queue heard
	  their position, it was an issue. This patch disables the ability
	  for the first caller in the queue to hear prompts and adds a new
	  option, announce-to-first-user, to queues.conf. Those who the
	  behavior can enable it by setting this value to True. Note that
	  if we ever implement the ability to have the prompts be stopped
	  upon bridging, this option can be removed. (closes issue

	  immediately after setting up the forward to the endpoint's topic.

	  main/bridging.c: Avoid unnecessary cleanups during immediate
	  shutdown This patch addresses issues during immediate shutdowns,
	  where modules are not unloaded, but Asterisk atexit handlers are
	  run. In the typical case, this usually isn't a big deal. But the
	  introduction of the Stasis message bus makes it much more likely
	  for asynchronous activity to be happening off in some thread
	  during shutdown. During an immediate shutdown, Asterisk skips
	  unloading modules. But while it is processing the atexit
	  handlers, there is a window of time where some of the core
	  message types have been cleaned up, but the message bus is still
	  running. Specifically, it's still running module subscriptions
	  that might be using the core message types. If a message is
	  received by that subscription in that window, it will attempt to
	  use a message type that has been cleaned up. To solve this
	  problem, this patch introduces ast_register_cleanup(). This
	  function operates identically to ast_register_atexit(), except
	  that cleanup calls are not invoked on an immediate shutdown. All
	  of the core message type and topic cleanup was moved from atexit
	  handlers to cleanup handlers. This ensures that core type and
	  topic cleanup only happens if the modules that used them are
	  first unloaded. This patch also changes the ast_assert() when
	  accessing a cleaned up or uninitialized message type to an error
	  log message. Message type functions are actually NULL safe across
	  the board, so the assert was a bit heavy handed. Especially for
	  anyone with DO_CRASH enabled. Review:

	* res/res_fax.c, res/res_fax_spandsp.c: Fix some more fax test
	  errors due to needing the peer in a bridge In r389799, a number
	  of fax errors in gateway mode were fixed by using the appropriate
	  function to get a channel's peer while in a bridge. This patch
	  does two things: (1) It uses the same function in res_fax_spandsp
	  while starting the fax gateway. Without this, the fax gateway
	  will not actually start up, as res_fax_spandsp also must inspect
	  the channel's peer in a two-party bridge (2) It refactors some
	  ao2 objects in sendfax_exec to use RAII_VAR. This was reverted in
	  r389799 as some off nominal paths were getting hit without the
	  fix in (1) that indicated an ao2 object issue; this turned out to
	  be a red herring (which is an odd phrase)

	* main/stasis_endpoints.c: Initialize the message type before the
	  topic Caching topics will during initialization attempt to
	  reference their message type. The message type therefore has to
	  be initialized prior to the topic to prevent the dreaded
	  assertion.

	* res/res_fax.c: Fix a few fax gateway failures Fax gateway
	  requires knowledge of a channel's peer in a bridge. This patch
	  now uses the supported mechanisms to get this information. This
	  is acceptable for a few reasons: * Fax gateway can only ever work
	  in a 2-party bridge * Fax gateway cannot work when not in a
	  bridge * Fax gateway cannot work without knowledge of the
	  capabilities of both channels in the fax operation (it is, after
	  all, a gateway)

	* main/asterisk.c, res/res_fax.c, main/devicestate.c: Fix a variety
	  of memory corruption/assertion errors * Initialize a Stasis-Core
	  message type prior to initializing a caching topic. The caching
	  topic will attempt to use the message type. * Don't attempt to
	  publish Stasis-Core messages from remote console connections.
	  They aren't the main process; they shouldn't attempt to behave as
	  it (they also don't have the infrastructure to do so) * Don't
	  treat a JSON object as an ao2 object (whoops) * In asterisk.c,
	  ref bump the JSON even package that is distributed with the event
	  meta data. The callers assume that they own the reference, and
	  the packing routine steals references.

	* main/asterisk.c: Restore initialization of security topics During
	  a merge the security topic initialization got blown away. This
	  patch restores it.

	* res/parking/parking_bridge.c: res_parking: Fix some simple bugs
	  Both of them are covered in the dynamic parking review on
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2550 - Remove unref against
	  parking lot that the bridge did on dissolve since the reference
	  wasn't taken in the first place. On a swap, reapply bridge roles
	  in order to get music on hold and such playing on the channel
	  that swaps into the bridge.

	* res/res_sip_session.c: Fix a crash due to the INVITE session
	  being destroyed before the session. This change ensures that the
	  INVITE session remains valid for the lifetime of the session
	  object itself by increasing the session count on the dialog that
	  the INVITE session is allocated from. Once this reaches zero
	  (normally as a result of decrementing it within the session
	  destructor) the dialog, and INVITE session, are destroyed.

	  which may be POSTed to to pause, unpause, reverse, forward or
	  restart the media playback. Attempts to control a playback that
	  is not currently playing will either return a 404 Not Found
	  (because the playback object no longer exists) or a 409 Conflict
	  (because the playback object is still in the queue to be played).

	  a channel while the channel is in the Stasis application. /play
	  commands are issued asynchronously, and return immediately with
	  the URL of the associated /playback resource. Playback commands
	  queue up, playing in succession. The /playback resource shows the
	  state of a playback operation as enqueued, playing or complete.
	  (Although the operation will only be in the 'complete' state for
	  a very short time, since it is almost immediately freed up).

	  main/devicestate.c: Fix shutdown assertions in stasis-core In
	  r388005, macros were introduced to consistently define message
	  types. This added an assert if a message type was used either
	  before it was initialized or after it had been cleaned up. It
	  turns out that this assertion fires during shutdown. This
	  actually exposed a hidden shutdown ordering problem. Since
	  unsubscribing is asynchronous, it's possible that the message
	  types used by the subscription could be freed before the final
	  message of the subscription was processed. This patch adds
	  stasis_subscription_join(), which blocks until the last message
	  has been processed by the subscription. Since joining was most
	  commonly done right after an unsubscribe, a
	  stasis_unsubscribe_and_join() convenience function was also
	  added. Similar functions were also added to the
	  stasis_caching_topic and stasis_message_router, since they wrap
	  subscriptions and have similar problems. Other code in trunk was
	  refactored to join() where appropriate, or at least verify that
	  the subscription was complete before being destroyed. Review:

	* apps/app_dial.c, main/channel.c, main/dial.c,
	  include/asterisk/stasis_channels.h, main/stasis_channels.c:
	  Publish the outbound channel's application/data when dialing This
	  patch does two things: * It fixes a bug where the outbound
	  channel's application/data set by the dialing API/app_dial is not
	  communicated until the channel is hung up. If that happens, AMI
	  would incorrectly send a NewExten event immediately after a
	  Hangup. This isn't really AMI's fault, as the dialing APIs never

	* apps/app_directory.c: Don't perform a realtime lookup with a NULL
	  keyword Previously, a call to ast_load_realtime_multientry could
	  get away with passing a NULL parameter to the function, even
	  though it really isn't supposed to do that. After the change over
	  to using ast_variable instead of variadic arguments, the realtime
	  engine gets unhappy if you do this. This was always an unintended
	  function call in app_directory anyway - now, we just don't call
	  into the realtime function calls if we don't have anything to
	  query on.

	  type field from channel blobs When we first introduced the
	  channel blob types, the JSON blobs were self identifying by a
	  required "type" field in the JSON object itself. This, as it
	  turns out, was a bad idea. When we introduced the message router,
	  it was useless for routing based on the JSON type. And messages
	  had two type fields to check: the stasis_message_type() of the
	  message itself, plus the type field in the JSON blob (but only if
	  it was a blob message). This patch corrects that mistake by
	  removing the required type field from JSON blobs, and introducing
	  first class stasis_message_type objects for the actual message
	  type. Since we now will have a proliferation of message types, I
	  introduced a few macros to help reduce the amount of boilerplate
	  necessary to set them up. Review:

	  endpoints. An endpoint is an external device/system that may
	  offer/accept channels to/from Asterisk. While this is a very
	  useful concept for end users, it is surprisingly not a core
	  concept within Asterisk itself. This patch defines ast_endpoint
	  as a separate object, which channel drivers may use to expose
	  their concept of an endpoint. As the channel driver creates
	  channels, it can use ast_endpoint_add_channel() to associate
	  channels to the endpoint. This updated the endpoint
	  appropriately, and forwards all of the channel's events to the
	  endpoint's topic. In order to avoid excessive locking on the
	  endpoint object itself, the mutable state is not accessible via
	  getters. Instead, you can create a snapshot using
	  ast_endpoint_snapshot_create() to get a consistent snapshot of
	  the internal state. This patch also includes a set of topics and
	  messages associated with endpoints, and implementations of the
	  endpoint-related RESTful API. chan_sip was updated to create
	  endpoints with SIP peers, but the state of the endpoints is not
	  updated with the state of the peer. Along for the ride in this
	  patch is a Stasis test API. This is a stasis_message_sink object,
	  which can be subscribed to a Stasis topic. It has functions for
	  blocking while waiting for conditions in the message sink to be
	  fulfilled. (closes issue ASTERISK-21421) Review:

	* /, apps/app_meetme.c: Make SLA reload more paranoid. Reload
	  support was originally not included for SLA. It was added later,
	  but in a fairly non-traditional way. It basically sets a flag
	  indicating that a reload is pending, and then waits for a time
	  where it thinks everything SLA related is idle and unused, and
	  *then* executes the reload. It does this because the reload
	  process is destructive. It starts by throwing everything away and
	  starting over. There are a number of problems with this approach.
	  One of them is that the check to see if anything in use was
	  incomplete. This patch makes it more complete and thus less
	  likely for a crash to occur during reload processing. However,
	  this approach still has problems so some much more significant
	  reworking of this code will need to come in as a next step. Patch

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Honor Session-Expires in 200OK

	  RFC 4028 Section 7.2 "UACs MUST be prepared to receive a
	  Session-Expires header field in a response, even if none were
	  present in the request." What changed After ASTERISK-20787,
	  inbound calls to asterisk with no Session-Expires in the INVITE
	  are now are offered a Session-Expires (1800 asterisk default) in
	  the response, with asterisk as the refresher. Symptom: After 900
	  seconds (asterisk default refresher period 1800), asterisk
	  RE-INVITEs the device, the device may respond with a much lower
	  Session-Expires (180 in our case) value that it is now using.
	  Asterisk ignores this response, as it's deemed both an INBOUND
	  CALL, and a RE-INVITE. After 180 seconds the device times out and
	  sends BYE (hangs up), asterisk is still working with the
	  refresher period of 1800 as it ignored the 'Session Expires: 180'
	  in the previous 200OK response. Fix: handle_response_invite()

	* main/features.c, /: Fix CDR not being created during an
	  externally initiated blind transfer Way back when in the dark
	  days of Asterisk 1.8.9, blind transferring a call in a context
	  that included the 'h' extension would inadvertently execute the
	  hangup code logic on the transferred channel. This was a "bad
	  thing". The fix was to properly check for the softhangup flags on
	  the channel and only execute the 'h' extension logic (and, in
	  later versions, hangup handler logic) if the channel was well and
	  truly dead (Jim). Unfortunately, CDRs are fickle. Setting the
	  softhangup flag when we detected that the channel was leaving the
	  bridge (but not to die) caused some crucial snippet of CDR code,
	  lying in ambush in the middle of the bridging code, to not get
	  executed. This had the effect of blowing away one of the CDRs
	  that is typically created during a blind transfer. While we live
	  and die by the adage "don't touch CDRs in release branches", this
	  was our bad. The attached patch restores the CDR behavior, and
	  still manages to not run the 'h' extension during a blind
	  transfer (at least not when it's supposed to). Thanks to Steve
	  Davies for diagnosing this and providing a fix. Review:

	  Example of how to use the Stasis message bus In order to get
	  people familiar with the Stasis message bus, it would be useful
	  to have something of a tutorial. Since I'm not clever enough to
	  think of some cool integration we could do with Twitter, I
	  settled for something that might actually be useful. This patch
	  adds a res_statsd.so module, which implements a basic statsd[1]
	  client. Statsd is a very simple statistics gathering server,
	  which can publish its results to a backend graphing engine, like
	  Graphite[2]. There are several different Statsd server
	  implementations[3], so you can pick what works best for your
	  environment. The actual example of how to use the Stasis message
	  bus is in res_chan_stats.so. This module demonstrates how to use
	  subscriptions and the message router by monitoring messages and
	  posting channels stats to the statsd server. A wiki page walking
	  through res_chan_stats.so is forthcoming. [1]:

	  feature-complete; however, with the completion of the
	  SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY API, all APIs (except a PUBLISH API) have been
	  created, and thus it is possible for developers to attempt to
	  create new SIP work. API documentation can be found in the
	  doxygen in the code, but usability documentation is still
	  lacking.

	  Swagger, a lightweight mechanism for documenting RESTful API's
	  using JSON. This allows us to use swagger-ui to provide
	  executable documentation for the API, generate client bindings in
	  different languages, and generate a lot of the boilerplate code
	  for implementing the RESTful bindings. The API docs live in the
	  rest-api/ directory. The RESTful bindings are generated from the
	  Swagger API docs using a set of Mustache templates. The code
	  generator is written in Python, and uses Pystache. Pystache has
	  no dependencies, and be installed easily using pip. Code
	  generation code lives in rest-api-templates/. The generated code
	  reduces a lot of boilerplate when it comes to handling HTTP
	  requests. It also helps us have greater consistency in the REST
	  API. (closes issue ASTERISK-20891) Review:

	* apps/app_meetme.c: sla: remove redundant locking. sla.lock was
	  already locked in the only place that sla_check_reload() was
	  called. Remove the redundant locking of sla.lock done in this

	* /, res/res_timing_pthread.c: Prevent res_timing_pthread from
	  blocking callers There were several reports of deadlock when
	  using res_timing_pthread. Backtraces indicated that one thread
	  was blocked waiting for the write to the pipe to complete and
	  this thread held the container lock for the timers. Therefore any
	  thread that wanted to create a new timer or read an existing
	  timer would block waiting for either the timer lock or the
	  container lock and deadlock ensued. This patch changes the way
	  the pipe is used to eliminate this source of deadlocks: 1) The
	  pipe is placed in non-blocking mode so that it would never block
	  even if the following changes someone fail... 2) Instead of
	  writing bytes into the pipe for each "tick" that's fired the pipe
	  now has two states--signaled and unsignaled. If signaled, the
	  pipe is hot and any pollers of the read side filedescriptor will
	  be woken up. If unsigned the pipe is idle. This eliminates even
	  the chance of filling up the pipe and reduces the potential
	  overhead of calling unnecessary writes. 3) Since we're tracking
	  the signaled / unsignaled state, we can eliminate the exta poll
	  system call for every firing because we know that there is data
	  to be read. (closes issue ASTERISK-21389) Reported by: Matt

	  Moved core logic from app_stasis to res_stasis After some
	  discussion on asterisk-dev, it was decided that the bulk of the
	  logic in app_stasis actually belongs in a resource module instead
	  of the application module. This patch does that, leaves the app
	  specific stuff in app_stasis, and fixes up everything else to be
	  consistent with that change. * Renamed test_app_stasis to
	  test_res_stasis * Renamed app_stasis.h to stasis_app.h * This is
	  still stasis application support, even though it's no longer in
	  an app_ module. The name should never have been tied to the type
	  of module, anyways. * Now that json isn't a resource module
	  anymore, moved the ast_channel_snapshot_to_json function to
	  main/stasis_channels.c, where it makes more sense. Review:

	  are now published on a channel's stasis_topic. AMI was refactored
	  to use these events rather than producing the events directly in
	  channel.c. Finally, the code was added to app_stasis to produce
	  DTMF events on the WebSocket. The AMI events are completely
	  backward compatible, including sending events on transmitted
	  DTMF, and sending DTMF start events. The Stasis-HTTP events are
	  somewhat simplified. Since DTMF start and DTMF send events are
	  generally less useful, Stasis-HTTP will only send events on
	  received DTMF end. (closes issue ASTERISK-21282) (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix One-Way Audio With auto_* NAT
	  Settings When SIP Calls Initiated By PBX When we reload Asterisk
	  or chan_sip, the flags force_rport and comedia that are turned on
	  and off when using the auto_force_rport and auto_comedia nat
	  settings go back to the default setting off. These flags are
	  turned on when needed or off when not needed at the time that a
	  peer registers, re-registers or initiates a call. This would
	  apply even when only the default global setting
	  "nat=auto_force_rport" is being used, which in this case would
	  only affect the force_rport flag. Everything is good except for
	  the following: The nat setting is set to auto_force_rport and
	  auto_comedia. We reload Asterisk and the peer's registration has
	  not expired. We load in the settings for the peer which turns
	  force_rport and comedia back to off. Since the peer has not
	  re-registered or placed a call yet, those flags remain off. We
	  then initiate a call to the peer from the PBX. The force_rport
	  and comedia flags stay off. If NAT is involved, we end up with
	  one-way audio since we never checked to see if the peer is behind
	  NAT or not. This patch does the following: * Moves the checking
	  of whether a peer is behind NAT into its own function * Create a
	  function to set the peer's NAT flags if they are using the auto_*
	  NAT settings * Adds calls in sip_request_call() to these new

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix crash in chan_sip when a core
	  initiated op occurs at the same time as a BYE When a BYE request
	  is processed in chan_sip, the current SIP dialog is detached from
	  its associated Asterisk channel structure. The tech_pvt pointer
	  in the channel object is set to NULL, and the dialog persists for
	  an RFC mandated period of time to handle re-transmits. While this
	  process occurs, the channel is locked (which is good).
	  Unfortunately, operations that are initiated externally have no
	  way of knowing that the channel they've just obtained (which is
	  still valid) and that they are attempting to lock is about to
	  have its tech_pvt pointer removed. By the time they obtain the
	  channel lock and call the channel technology callback, the
	  tech_pvt is NULL. This patch adds a few checks to some channel
	  callbacks that make sure the tech_pvt isn't NULL before using it.
	  Prime offenders were the DTMF digit callbacks, which would crash
	  if AMI initiated a DTMF on the channel at the same time as a BYE
	  was received from the UA. This patch also adds checks on
	  sip_transfer (as AMI can also cause a callback into this
	  function), as well as sip_indicate (as lots of things can queue
	  an indication onto a channel). Review:

	  can store multiple ast_channel_snapshot objects along with a
	  single JSON blob. The payload object itself is opaque; the
	  snapshots are stored in a container keyed by roles. APIs have
	  been provided to query for and retrieve the snapshots from the
	  payload object. * The Dial AMI events have been refactored onto
	  Stasis. This includes dial messages in app_dial, as well as the
	  core dialing framework. The AMI events have been modified to send
	  out a DialBegin/DialEnd events, as opposed to the subevent type
	  that was previously used. * Stasis messages, types, and other
	  objects related to channels have been placed in their own file,
	  stasis_channels. Unit tests for some of these objects/messages
	  have also been written.

	  the API that binds the Stasis dialplan application to external

	  application support. This module registers a dialplan function
	  named Stasis, which is used to put a channel into the named
	  Stasis app. As a channel enters and leaves the Stasis diaplan
	  application, the Stasis app receives a 'stasis-start' and
	  'stasis-end' events. Stasis apps register themselves using the
	  stasis_app_register and stasis_app_unregister functions. Messages
	  are sent to an application using stasis_app_send. Finally, Stasis
	  apps control channels through the use of the stasis_app_control
	  object, and the family of stasis_app_control_* functions. Other

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, UPGRADE-11.txt: Fix For Not Overriding
	  The Default Settings In chan_sip The initial report was that the
	  "nat" setting in the [general] section was not having any effect
	  in overriding the default setting. Upon confirming that this was
	  happening and looking into what was causing this, it was
	  discovered that other default settings would not be overriden as
	  well. This patch works similar to what occurs in build_peer(). We
	  create a temporary ast_flags structure and using a mask, we
	  override the default settings with whatever is set in the
	  [general] section. In the bug report, the reporter who helped to
	  test this patch noted that the directmedia settings were being
	  overriden properly as well as the nat settings. This issue is

	* contrib/scripts/install_prereq: install_prereq: Build jansson
	  from source, when necessary When r383579 was committed, it made
	  Jansson a required dependency. While libjansson-dev and
	  jansson-devel are available on recent distros, some older (but
	  still supported) distros don't have it. There's a pull request[1]
	  to get it into repoforge, but that still doesn't help everyone.
	  (And helps no one until the pull request is merged and packages
	  are built). This patch adds Jansson install from source to the
	  install_unpackaged() function. There are a few gotcha's, which
	  makes this change not completely trivial. * Since Jansson may be
	  installed by a package, don't install from source if a package
	  installation can be found * libresample may also be installed via
	  package, so I added a similar check to that. * Since Jansson
	  installs into /usr/local, this patch also adds /usr/local/lib to
	  /etc/ld.so.conf.d so that the library can be found. * The
	  alternative was to install into /usr, but then it gets
	  complicated having to deal with EL's /usr/lib{32,64} shenanigans.

	* main/stasis.c, tests/test_stasis.c: stasis: Fixed message
	  ordering issues when forwarding This patch fixes an issue of
	  message ordering that occurs when multiple topics are forwarded
	  to an aggregator topic (such as ast_channel_topic_all()). It is
	  (very reasonably) expected that the rules governing message
	  dispatch order still apply, so long as the messages start from
	  the same thread, and are received by the same subscription.
	  Because the existing code had an additional layer of dispatching
	  via the Stasis thread pool for forwards, those promises couldn't
	  be kept. Forwarding subscriptions no longer have their own
	  mailbox, and now dispatch directly from the forwarding topic's
	  stasis_publish() call. This means that the topic's lock is held
	  for the duration of not only a message's dispatch, but the
	  dispatch of all the forwards. This shouldn't be a problem right
	  now, but if an aggregator topic had many subscribers, it could
	  become a problem. But I figure we can write more clever code when
	  the time comes, if necessary. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve deadlock between SIP registration
	  and channel based functions In r373424, several reentrancy
	  problems in chan_sip were addressed. As a result, the SIP channel
	  driver is now properly locking the channel driver private
	  information in certain operations that it wasn't previously. This
	  exposed two latent problems either in register_verify or by
	  functions called by register_verify. This includes: * Holding the
	  private lock while calling sip_send_mwi_to_peer. This can create
	  a new sip_pvt via sip_alloc, which will obtain the channel
	  container lock. This is a locking inversion, as any channel
	  related lock must be obtained prior to obtaining the SIP channel
	  technology private lock. Note that this issue was already fixed
	  in Asterisk 11. * Holding the private lock while calling
	  sip_poke_peer. In the same vein as sip_send_mwi_to_peer,
	  sip_poke_peer can create a new SIP private, causing the same
	  locking inversion. Note that this locking inversion typically
	  occured when CLI commands were run while a SIP REGISTER request
	  was being processed, as many CLI commands (such as 'sip show
	  channels', 'core show channels', etc.) have to obtain the channel
	  container lock. (issue ASTERISK-21068) Reported by: Nicolas

	  configured there had to become a part of the channel snapshot.
	  These are now a part of every snapshot based event, making the
	  configuration description "every time a channel-oriented event is

	  NULL. This can clean up a lot of NULL checking we're doing

	* main/asterisk.c, main/json.c, include/asterisk/json.h: Corrected
	  some module issues introduced by r383579. When I moved res_json.c

	  main/manager.c, configure, res/res_json.exports.in (removed):
	  Move more channel events to Stasis; move res_json.c to
	  main/json.c. This patch started out simply as fixing the bouncing
	  tests introduced in r382685, but required some other changes to
	  give it a decent implementation. To fix the bouncing tests, the
	  UserEvent and Newexten AMI events needed to be refactored to
	  dispatch via Stasis. Dispatching directly to AMI resulted in
	  those events sometimes getting ahead of the associated Newchannel
	  events, which would understandably confuse anyone. I found that
	  instead of creating a zillion different message types and
	  structures associated with them, it would be preferable to define
	  a message type that has a channel snapshot and a blob of
	  structured data with a small bit of additional information. The
	  JSON object model provides a very nice way of representing
	  structured data, so I went with that. * Move JSON support from
	  res_json.c to main/json.c * Made libjansson-dev a required
	  dependency * Added an ast_channel_blob message type, which has a
	  channel snapshot and JSON blob of data. * Changed UserEvent and
	  Newexten events so that they are dispatched via ast_channel_blob
	  messages on the channel's topic. * Got rid of the
	  ast_channel_varset message; used ast_channel_blob instead. *
	  Extracted the manager functions converting Stasis channel events
	  to AMI events into manager_channel.c. (issue ASTERISK-21096)

	* main/stasis.c: Resolve a race condition in Stasis Because of the
	  way that topics were handled when publishing, it was possible to
	  dispatch a message to a subscription after that subscription had
	  been unsubscribed such that the dispatched message arrived at the
	  callback after the callback had received its final message. In
	  callbacks that cleaned up user data, this would often cause a
	  segfault. This has been resolved by locking the topic during the
	  entirety of dispatch. To prevent long publishing and topic
	  locking times, forwarding subscriptions have been made to be
	  standard subscriptions instead of mailboxless subscriptions which
	  were dispatched at publishing time.

	  stasis_message_router is constructed for a particular
	  stasis_topic, which is subscribes to. Call
	  stasis_message_router_unsubscribe() to cancel that subscription.
	  Once constructed, routes can be added using

	  stasis_message_router_set_default() for any messages not handled
	  by other routes). There may be only one route per

	  Stasis events, which manager.c uses to then publish the AMI
	  event. This message bus provides a generic publish/subscribe
	  mechanism within Asterisk. This message bus is: - Loosely
	  coupled; new message types can be added in seperate modules. -
	  Easy to use; publishing and subscribing are straightforward
	  operations. In addition to basic publish/subscribe, the patch
	  also provides mechanisms for message forwarding, and for message
	  caching. (issue ASTERISK-20887) (closes issue ASTERISK-20959)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove unused function After r382670,
	  get_ip_and_port_from_sdp was no longer used.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't reset the RTP address on a glare
	  re-INVITE Originally, way back in r201583, we added the alternate
	  RTP address so that the RTP engine would expect to receive audio
	  from a new source when a glare re-INVITE occurred. In r382589, we
	  remove the alternate RTP source, as the 'secret' probation mode
	  allows for switching to a new RTP source when a previous source
	  stops sending RTP. At the time, it seemed appropriate to set the
	  RTP source based on the information in the glared re-INVITE.
	  Unfortunately, that doesn't work so well - in a glared re-INVITE
	  that occurs with no SDP - such as in a connected line update that
	  glances - we'll set the RTP source to an invalid address. In
	  subsequent re-INVITE requests from this Asterisk instance, we'll
	  then send an invalid media address, which will result in the
	  remote side sending a 488. Whoops. There isn't any need to reset
	  the RTP source - if we're using strictrtp, we'll simply
	  synchronize to a new source when we stop getting packets from the
	  old one. If we aren't using strictrtp, then again there shouldn't
	  be a problem. Note that the Asterisk Test Suite's connectedline
	  test caught this error.

	  main/rtp_engine.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c: Add a 'secret'
	  probation strictrtp mode to handle delayed changes in RTP source
	  Often, Asterisk may realize that a change in the source of an RTP
	  stream is about to occur and ask that the RTP engine reset it's
	  lock on the current RTP source. In certain scenarios, it may take
	  awhile for the new remote system to send RTP packets, while the
	  old remote system may continue providing RTP during that time
	  period. This causes Asterisk to re-lock onto the old source,
	  thereby rejecting the new source when the old source stops
	  sending RTP and the new source begins. This patch prevents that
	  by having a constant secondary, 'secret' probation mode enabled
	  when an RTP source has been chosen. RTP packets from other
	  sources are always considered, but never chosen unless the
	  current RTP source stops sending RTP. Review:

	  / Clean Up Some Items To Handle The New auto_* NAT Options The
	  original report had to do with a realtime peer behind NAT being
	  pruned and the peer's private address being used instead of its

	  global nat setting is auto_force_rport * Constify the 'req'
	  parameter for check_via() * Add calls to check_via() in a couple
	  of places in order for the auto_* settings to do their job in
	  attempting to determine if NAT is involved * Set the flags
	  SIP_NAT_FORCE_RPORT and SIP_PAGE2_SYMMETRICRTP if the auto_*
	  settings are in use where it was needed * Moves the copying of
	  peer flags up in build_peer() to before they are used; this fixes

	* /, apps/app_meetme.c, CHANGES: Let channels joining a MeetMe
	  conference opt out of the denoiser For some channel drivers,
	  specifically those that have a varying rate in the number of
	  audio samples, the audio quality for a MeetMe conference can be
	  exceedingly poor. This is due to a unilateral application of the
	  DENOISE function in func_speex to channels joining the
	  conference. The denoiser function in the speex library is
	  initialized with the number of audio samples in each sample that
	  will be provided to it. If the number of audio samples changes,
	  the denoiser has to be thrown away and re-initialized. While this
	  could be worked around by removing func_speex, that doesn't help
	  if you actually use the denoiser with other channels on the
	  system. This patches does the following: * Checks for the
	  presence of func_speex as opposed to codec_speex when determining
	  if the DENOISE function is present (which is where the function
	  is actually implemented) * Adds an option to MeetMe 'n' that
	  causes the denoiser to not be applied to a channel when it joins.
	  This keeps the current behavior the default, but let's users
	  disable the denoiser if it causes problems on their system.

	  co-existing in a conference (thereby implementing a state machine
	  for the conference), the wait_marked users were put into their
	  own list of conference participants, separate from the active

	  it is being compared against. This prevents ALL from being

	* /, res/res_agi.c: Fix FastAGI To Properly Check For A Connection
	  When IPv6 support was added to FastAGI, the intent was to have
	  the ability to check all addresses resolved for a host since we
	  might receive an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address. The problem
	  with the current code, is that, since we are doing O_NONBLOCK, we
	  get EINPROGRESS when calling ast_connect() but are ignoring this
	  instead of handling it. We break out of the loop and continue on.
	  When we later call ast_poll(), it succeeds but we never check if
	  we have a connection or not on the socket level. We then attempt
	  to send data to the host address that we think is setup and it
	  fails. We then check the errno and see that we have "connection
	  refused" and then return with agi failed. This patch does the
	  following: * Handles EINPROGRESS by creating the function
	  handle_connection() - ast_poll() was moved into this function -
	  This function checks the results of the connection on the socket
	  level after calling ast_poll() * Continues to the next address if
	  the above fails to create a connection * Once all addresses
	  resolved are tried and we still are unable to establish a
	  connection, then we return that the FastAGI call failed (closes

	* apps/app_confbridge.c: Confbridge channels staying active when

	* apps/app_confbridge.c, /: Fixed Confbridge file recording
	  deadlock and appending. A deadlock occurred after
	  starting/stopping and then restarting a confbridge recording.
	  Upon starting a recording a record thread is created that holds a
	  lock until just before exiting. Stopping the recording does not
	  stop/exit the thread or release the lock. The thread waits until
	  recording begins again. Starting a stopped recording signals the
	  thread to continue and start recording again. However restarting
	  the recording also created another record thread resulting in a
	  deadlock. The fix was to make sure the record thread was only
	  created once. Also it was noted that filenames for the recordings
	  were being concatenated for each start/stop. This was fixed by
	  creating a new file for each conference session and appending the
	  actual recorded data within the file (e.g. passing the 'a' option
	  to MixMonitor). (issue AST-1088) Reported by: John Bigelow

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a crash that occurred when a BYE was

	  The result was that if a BYE for a dialog that had been replaced
	  (via an INVITE with Replaces) was received, Asterisk would crash
	  due to trying to access data on a channel that was no longer
	  there. The fix I introduced is to remove code that both unrefs
	  the sip_pvt and sets the channel's tech_pvt to NULL when an
	  INVITE with Replaces is handled. This way when a BYE is received,
	  the tech_pvt will be non-NULL and so the BYE can be processed and

	* apps/app_confbridge.c: Adding Some More Manager Events To
	  ConfBridge Currently, ConfBridge does not send manager events for
	  ConfbridgeMute, ConfbridgeUnmute, ConfbridgeStartRecord and
	  ConfbridgeStopRecord. This patch adds these events to the
	  manager. The reporter's patch moves some other events up to the
	  beginning of the file. The patch being committed is based on the
	  patch contributed from the reporter of this issue. I have made a
	  lot of modifications to the patch in order for it to fit in
	  better with what we currently are doing in the code when it comes
	  to manager events. I also made a few changes to the <see-also>
	  elements on some of the events. (closes issue ASTERISK-20827)

	* res/res_sorcery_config.c: Fix a bug where a changed configuration
	  file might not be available to all sorcery object types. Since
	  res_sorcery_config used a static name of "res_sorcery_config" to
	  inform the configuration file API that it asked for the
	  configuration file it was possible during a reload for some
	  sorcery object types not to receive the new configuration file.
	  This change introduces a UUID on a per-sorcery config instance
	  basis so that the unchanged state is kept on an instance basis
	  and not for the res_sorcery_config module as a whole.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Unregister SIP provider API if module
	  load is declined A user in #asterisk ran into a problem where a
	  configuration error prevented the chan_sip module from being
	  loaded. Upon fixing their configuratione error, they could no
	  longer load the chan_sip module. This was because the
	  configuration checking happened after the SIP provider was
	  registered with the Asterisk core, and subsequent attempts to
	  load the SIP module failed as the provider was already
	  registered. Since we want to detect any failure in registering
	  chan_sip as early as possible (as that could be emblematic of a
	  deeper mismatch between module and Asterisk core), this patch
	  does not change the registration location, but does ensure that
	  if a module load is declined, we unregister the module as the SIP
	  api provider. ........ Merged revisions 380480 from

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Perform case insensitive comparisons for
	  T.38 attributes RFC5347 section 2.5.2 states the following: ...
	  The attribute "T38MaxBitRate" was once incorrectly registered
	  with IANA as "T38maxBitRate" (lower-case "m"). In accordance with
	  T.38 examples and common implementation practice, the form
	  "T38MaxBitRate" SHOULD be generated by implementations conforming
	  to this package. In general, it is RECOMMENDED that
	  implementations of this package accept lowercase, uppercase, and
	  mixed upper/lowercase encodings of all the T.38 attributes. ...
	  Asterisk currently does not perform case insensitive matching on
	  the T.38 attributes. This causes the T38MaxBitRate attribute to
	  be negotiated at 2400 baud instead of 14400 (or whatever value
	  you actually wanted). This patch makes it so that when we compare
	  T.38 attributes, we do so in a case insensitive fashion. Note
	  that while the issue reporter did not directly write the patch,
	  they contributed to it (and would have provided one themselves if
	  the license had gone through a tad faster), and hence get
	  attribution for it. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure that a declined media stream is
	  terminated with a '\r\n' In r369028, chan_sip's processing of
	  media streams in an SDP was modified to better handle multiple
	  offered media streams. Part of that change modified how streams
	  were declined. Previously, declined media streams were not
	  handled in an RFC compliant manner; now, we set the port number
	  to 0 in the media stream definition and proceed on with the next
	  media stream. Unfortunately, the formatting of the declined media
	  stream forgot to append a '\r\n' to the end of the media stream.
	  This is normally added to the accepted media streams later on in
	  the processing of the SDP. Since the declined media stream uses a
	  different buffer than the accepted media streams (and is a
	  malloc'd buffer as opposed to a struct ast_str), it's easier to
	  just slap the '\r\n' on the declined media stream buffer rather
	  than attempt to append it later on. So, that's what we do. And
	  now some devices (and probably some providers) will be a bit
	  happier (but probably not terribly happy, since we just rejected
	  something they offered). Review:

	* main/file.c, /: Change cleanup ordering in filestream destructor.
	  This patch came about due to a problem observed where wav files
	  had an empty header. The header is supposed to be updated in
	  wav_close(). It turns out that this was broken when the
	  cache_record_files option from asterisk.conf was enabled. The
	  cleanup code was moving the file to its final destination
	  *before* running the close() method of the file destructor, so
	  the header didn't get updated. Another problem here is that the
	  move was being done before actually closing the FILE *. Finally,
	  the last bug fixed here is that I noticed that wav_close() checks
	  for stream->filename to be non-NULL. In the previous cleanup
	  order, it's checking a pointer to freed memory. This doesn't
	  actually cause anything to break, but it's treading on dangerous
	  waters. Now the free() of stream->filename is happening after the
	  format module's close() method gets called, so it's safer.

	  handle stderr; readd splash screen for remote consoles When
	  r376428 was commited to re-order start up sequences to be more
	  tolerant of forking with thread primitives, a few items were
	  changed that caused changes in behavior on some distros. This
	  includes: * Not displaying the splash screen on a remote console.
	  * Displaying an error message on stderr when a remote console
	  cannot connect to a running instance of Asterisk. In the first
	  case, the splash screen was re-added (thanks to Michael L.
	  Young). In the second case, the various init.d scripts were
	  modified to pipe stderr to /dev/null, as the error message is
	  useful - if you execute a remote console or a remote console
	  command execution and it fail, it should tell you. Note that the
	  error message was always present, it just failed to be printed
	  prior to r376428. Much thanks to the folks who quickly reported
	  this problem, provided solutions, and promptly tested the various
	  init.d scripts on a variety of distros. (closes issue

	  (added), tests/test_taskprocessor.c (added): Add threadpool
	  support to Asterisk. This commit consists of two parts. Part one
	  changes the taskprocessor API to be less self-contained. Instead,
	  the taskprocessor is now more of a task queue that informs a
	  listener of changes to the queue. The listener then has the
	  responsibility of executing the tasks as it pleases. There is a
	  default listener implementation that functions the same way as
	  "classic" taskprocessors, in that it creates a single thread for
	  tasks to execute in. Old users of taskprocessors have not been
	  altered and still function the same way. Part two introduces the
	  threadpool API. A threadpool is a special type of taskprocessor
	  listener that has multiple threads associated with it. The
	  threadpool also has an optional listener that can adjust the
	  threadpool as conditions change. In addition the threadpool has a
	  set of options that can allow for the threadpool to grow and
	  shrink on its own as tasks are added and executed. Both set of
	  changes contain accompanying unit tests. (closes issue

	* addons/chan_mobile.c, /: Fix issue where chan_mobile fails to

	  to the first available port, the rc_channel field of the socket
	  addressing structure used to bind the socket should be set to 0.
	  Previously, Asterisk had set the rc_channel field set to 1,
	  causing it to connect to whatever happens to be on port 1. We
	  could probably not explicitly set rc_channel to 0 since we memset
	  the struct earlier, but explicitly setting it will hopefully
	  prevent someone from coming in and setting it to some explicit

	  reduce masquerade insanity Masquerades are an insane
	  implementation detail within Asterisk. It generates a number of
	  useless and confusing events, and manipulates channels in a way
	  that semantically doesn't make sense. I've given a fairly
	  thorough review of masquerade code and its usage on the wiki at
	  https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/x/IwBRAQ. While ultimately it
	  makes the most sense to abandon masquerades altogether, it will
	  take some time to completely irradicate. Even then, there may
	  always be code that's not worth rewriting to get rid of the
	  masquerade. This patch does two things to make masquerades
	  slightly less insane: * When swapping the names of the original
	  and clone channel, only emit a single rename event of original ->
	  original<ZOMBIE>. The original code issued three rename events to
	  accomplish the same end. * In addition to swapping the names of
	  the channels, also swap their uniqueid's. This allows the

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, /, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  tests/test_xml_escape.c (added), main/utils.c: Fix XML encoding
	  of 'identity display' in NOTIFY messages. XML encoding in
	  chan_sip is accomplished by naively building the XML directly
	  from strings. While this usually works, it fails to take into
	  account escaping the reserved characters in XML. This patch adds
	  an 'ast_xml_escape' function, which works similarly to
	  'ast_uri_encode'. This is used to properly escape the
	  local_display attribute in XML formatted NOTIFY messages. Several
	  things to note: * The Right Thing(TM) to do would probably be to
	  replace the ast_build_string stuff with building an ast_xml_doc.
	  That's a much bigger change, and out of scope for the original
	  ticket, so I refrained myself. * It is with great sadness that I
	  wrote my own ast_xml_escape function. There's one in libxml2, but
	  it's knee-deep in libxml2-ness, and not easily used to one-off
	  escape a string. * I only escaped the string we know is causing
	  problems (local_display). At least some of the other strings are
	  URI-encoded, which should be XML safe. Rather than figuring out
	  what's safe and escaping what's not, it would be much cleaner to
	  simply build an ast_xml_doc for the messages and let the XML
	  library do the XML escaping. Like I said, that's out of scope.

	  without a valid SRTP session which will result in the caller of

	  of device state information can query for the last known state
	  for a particular device, even if it is not part of an active
	  call. The concept of a device in Asterisk can include entities
	  that do not have a physical representation. One way that this
	  occurred was when anonymous calls are allowed in Asterisk. A
	  device was automatically created and stored in the cache for each
	  anonymous call that occurred; this was possible in the SIP and
	  IAX2 channel drivers and through channel drivers that utilized
	  the res_jabber/res_xmpp resource modules (Gtalk, Jingle, and
	  Motif). These devices are never removed from the system, allowing
	  anonymous calls to potentially exhaust a system's resources. This
	  patch changes the event cache subsystem and device state
	  management to no longer cache devices that are not associated
	  with a physical entity. (issue ASTERISK-20175) Reported by:

	* main/http.c, res/res_jabber.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h, /,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve crashes due to large stack
	  allocations when using TCP Asterisk had several places where
	  messages received over various network transports may be copied
	  in a single stack allocation. In the case of TCP, since multiple
	  packets in a stream may be concatenated together, this can lead
	  to large allocations that overflow the stack. This patch modifies
	  those portions of Asterisk using TCP to either favor heap
	  allocations or use an upper bound to ensure that the stack will
	  not overflow: * For SIP, the allocation now has an upper limit *
	  For HTTP, the allocation is now a heap allocation instead of a
	  stack allocation * For XMPP (in res_jabber), the allocation has
	  been eliminated since it was unnecesary. Note that the HTTP
	  portion of this issue was independently found by Brandon Edwards
	  of Exodus Intelligence. (issue ASTERISK-20658) Reported by:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a SIP request memory leak with TLS

	  This function is now given a SIP request structure which it can

	  memory allocations done since the internal allocated components
	  are reused between packets and also ensures the SIP request
	  structure is deinitialized when the TLS connection is torn down.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix potential crashes during SIP attended
	  transfers. The principal behind this patch is simple. During a
	  transfer, we manipulate channels that are owned by a separate
	  thread than the one we currently are running in, so it makes
	  sense that we need to grab a reference to the channels so that
	  they cannot disappear out from under us. In the wild, crashes
	  were sometimes seen when the transferring party would hang up the
	  call before the transfer target answered the call. The most
	  common place to see the crash occur was when attempting to send a
	  connected line update to the transferer channel. (closes issue

	* main/lock.c, /, main/logger.c, include/asterisk/lock.h:
	  Re-initialize logmsgs mutex upon logger initialization to prevent
	  lock errors Similar to the patch that moved the fork earlier in
	  the startup sequence to prevent mutex errors in the recursive
	  mutex surrounding the read/write thread registration lock, this
	  patch re-initializes the logmsgs mutex. Part of the start up
	  sequence before forking the process into the background includes
	  reading asterisk.conf; this has to occur prior to the call to
	  daemon in order to read startup parameters. When reading in a
	  conf file, log statements can be generated. Since this can't be
	  avoided, the mutex instead is re-initialized to ensure a reset of
	  any thread tracking information. This patch also includes some
	  additional debugging to catch errors when locking or unlocking
	  the recursive mutex that surrounds locks when the DEBUG_THREADS
	  build option is enabled. DO_CRASH or THREAD_CRASH will cause an
	  abort() if a mutex error is detected. (issue ASTERISK-19463)

	* tests/test_astobj2.c: Fix uninitialized in this function error
	  With some versions of gcc, n_buckets will be flagged as being
	  uninitialized before use. While its technically impossible (since
	  the switch statement, even without a default, accounts for all
	  possibilities), we'll initialize the variable to 0 anyway.

	* main/asterisk.c, /, main/utils.c: Reorder startup sequence to
	  prevent lockups when process is sent to background Although it is
	  very rare and timing dependent, the potential exists for the call
	  to 'daemon' to cause what appears to be a deadlock in Asterisk
	  during startup. This can occur when a recursive mutex is obtained
	  prior to the daemon call executing. Since daemon uses fork to
	  send the process into the background, any threading primitives
	  are unsafe to re-use after the call. Implementations of pthread
	  recursive mutexes are highly likely to store the thread
	  identifier of the thread that previously obtained the mutex. If
	  the mutex was locked prior to the fork, a subsequent unlock
	  operation will potentially fail as the thread identifier is no
	  longer valid. Since the mutex is still locked, all subsequent
	  attempts to grab the mutex by other threads will block. This
	  behavior exhibited itself most often when DEBUG_THREADS was
	  enabled, as this compile time option surrounds the mutexes in
	  Asterisk with another recursive mutex that protects the storage
	  of thread related information. This made it much more likely that
	  a recursive mutex would be obtained prior to daemon and unlocked
	  after the call. This patch does the following: a) It backports a
	  patch from Asterisk 11 that prevents the spawning of the
	  localtime monitoring thread. This thread is now spawned after
	  Asterisk has fully booted. b) It re-orders the startup sequence
	  to call daemon earlier during Asterisk startup. This limits the
	  potential of threading primitives being accessed by
	  initialization calls before daemon is called. c) It removes calls
	  to ast_verbose/ast_log/etc. prior to daemon being called.
	  Developers should send error messages directly to stderr prior to
	  daemon, as calls to ast_log may access recursive mutexes that
	  store thread related information. d) It reorganizes when thread
	  local storage is created for storing lock information during the
	  creation of threads. Prior to this patch, the read/write lock
	  protecting the list of threads in ast_register_thread would
	  utilize the lock in the thread local storage prior to it being
	  initialized; this patch prevents that. On a very related note,
	  this patch will *greatly* improve the stability of the Asterisk
	  Test Suite. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2197

	  thrash hash tables (hashtab and ao2 containers, respectively), by
	  spinning up several threads that randomly insert, delete, lookup
	  and iterate over the hash table. If the app doesn't crash, the
	  hash table probably passes the test. Those utils are not a part
	  of the typical Asterisk build, so they do not usually get
	  compiled. This all makes them less that useful. This patch
	  removes those manual test programs and replaces them with
	  Asterisk unit test modules (test_{hashtab,astobj2}_thrash.so). It
	  also attempts to make the tests more deterministic. * Rather than
	  spinning up some number of threads that operate on the hash table
	  randomly, spin up four threads that concurrenly add, remove,
	  lookup and iterate over the hash table. * Each thread checks the
	  state of the hash table both during and after execution, and
	  indicates a test failure if things are not as expected. * Each
	  thread times out after 60 seconds to prevent deadlocking the unit
	  test run. (closes issue ASTERISK-20505) Reported by: Matt Jordan

	  misuses of timeouts throughout the code. Prior to this change, a
	  common method for determining if a timeout was reached was to
	  call a function such as ast_waitfor_n() and inspect the out
	  parameter that told how many milliseconds were left, then use
	  that as the input to ast_waitfor_n() on the next go-around. The
	  problem with this is that in some cases, submillisecond timeouts
	  can occur, resulting in the out parameter not decreasing any.
	  When this happens thousands of times, the result is that the
	  timeout takes much longer than intended to be reached. As an
	  example, I had a situation where a 3 second timeout took multiple
	  days to finally end since most wakeups from ast_waitfor_n() were
	  under a millisecond. This patch seeks to fix this pattern
	  throughout the code. Now we log the time when an operation began
	  and find the difference in wall clock time between now and when
	  the event started. This means that sub-millisecond timeouts now
	  cannot play havoc when trying to determine if something has timed
	  out. Part of this fix also includes changing the function
	  ast_waitfor() so that it is possible for it to return less than
	  zero when a negative timeout is given to it. This makes it
	  actually possible to detect errors in ast_waitfor() when there is
	  no timeout. (closes issue ASTERISK-20414) reported by David M.

	  and handle the error in timer users Currently, if an
	  acknowledgement of a timer fails Asterisk will not realize that a
	  serious error occurred and will continue attempting to use the
	  timer's file descriptor. This can lead to situations where errors
	  stream to the CLI/log file. This consumes significant resources,
	  masks the actual problem that occurred (whatever caused the timer
	  to fail in the first place), and can leave channels in odd
	  states. This patch propagates the errors in the timing resource
	  modules up through the timer core, and makes users of these
	  timers handle acknowledgement failures. It also adds some
	  defensive coding around the use of timers to prevent using bad
	  file descriptors in off nominal code paths. Note that the patch
	  created by the issue reporter was modified slightly for this
	  commit and backported to 1.8, as it was originally written for
	  Asterisk 10. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2178/

	* main/cdr.c, /: Prevent multiple CDR batches from conflicting when
	  scheduling the CDR write The Asterisk Test Suite caught an error
	  condition where a scheduled CDR batch write can be deleted twice
	  if two channels attempt to post their CDRs at the same time. The
	  batch CDR mutex is locked while the CDRs are appended to the
	  current batch list; however, it is unlocked prior to actually
	  scheduling the CDR write. As such, two threads can attempt to
	  remove the currently scheduled batch write at the same time,
	  resulting in an assertion error. This patch extends the time that
	  the mutex is locked to encompass actually scheduling the write.
	  This prevents two threads from unscheduling the currently
	  scheduled write at the same time. ........ Merged revisions

	  chan_misdn: Fix loss of B channels if L1 is down. If you make 2
	  calls out an NT PTMP port which is not connected to any phone,
	  the B channel associated with that call becomes unusable until
	  Asterisk is restarted. The problem is the EVENT_SETUP is queued
	  when L1 is not up in misdn_lib_send_event(). If L1 cannot be
	  activated the event won't be dequeued. It gets even worse when
	  the call is hung up. The queued EVENT_SETUP will be overwritten
	  by an EVENT_DISCONNECT. The reserved B channel then will never be
	  freed. If later someone connects a phone to the port, L1 will
	  eventually activate and the queued EVENT_DISCONNECT is sent down
	  the stack. However, it is ignored because it is the wrong call
	  state. The real fix would be that activation and queueing for a
	  new SETUP is done by the NT stack. But since it doesn't, the
	  workaround must be removed because it doesn't always work. Fix:
	  The event is no longer queued but immediately sent to the stack.
	  If L1 cannot be activated, the L3 state machine that was started
	  by the EVENT_SETUP will do its work, i.e. a timeout will release
	  the B channel properly. The SETUP possibly cannot be sent the
	  first time but is resent by T303 in case L1 could be activated.

	* /, res/res_calendar_ews.c: Properly extract the Body information
	  of an EWS calendar item Unlike all other calendar modules,
	  res_calendar_ews fails to extract the Body information for a
	  calendar item. This is due, in part, to a quirk in the schema in
	  the XML - not only does a CalendarItem contain a Body element,
	  but the CalendarItem exists as a descendant of a different Body
	  element. The neon parser was erroneously skipping all Body
	  elements. This patch fixes that by bypassing Body elements that
	  are not a child of CalendarItem, and parsing the Body element out
	  if it is a child. Note that the original patch by Terry Wilson
	  only needed slight modifications to make it properly pull the
	  Body information out; as such, while I've linked to the patch
	  that I uploaded for Dmitry, I've attributed the patch to Terry.

	* UPGRADE.txt, apps/app_queue.c: Ensure that CDRs for a caller in a
	  Queue that is not answered is NO ANSWER. When a caller enters a
	  queue and no queue member answers the call, the current behaviour
	  can be a little odd depending on the paused status of the queue
	  members. If any queue member is paused, but not all, the CDR
	  disposition will be BUSY. If all queue members are paused, then
	  the CDR disposition is based instead on the disposition of the
	  call prior to entering the Queue. This patch modifies the
	  behaviour in the following ways: * If no queue members are
	  paused, the CDR disposition is whatever the disposition was prior
	  to going into Queue. If the call was answered this will be
	  ANSWERED; otherwise, it is NO ANSWER. * If some queue members are
	  pused, the CDR result is NO ANSWER. (This is a change in
	  behaviour, as the result would previously have been BUSY) * If
	  all queue members are paused, the CDR result is whatever the
	  result was prior to going into Queue. This is the same as the
	  behaviour prior to this patch. * If the caller hangs up, times
	  out, or presses '*' with the 'h' option, the CDR disposition is
	  again not set and is dependent on whether or not the caller was
	  Answered prior to entering Queue. This patch was based on one
	  provided by Thomas Arimont, but has been modified to accomodate
	  findings by the reviewers. Review:

	* main/manager.c: manager: remove curses dependent stuff from

	* apps/app_alarmreceiver.c, configs/alarmreceiver.conf.sample: Adds
	  new formats to app_alarmreceiver, ALAW calls support and enhanced
	  protection. Commiting this on behalf of Kaloyan Kovachev (license
	  5506). AlarmReceiver now supports the following DTMF signaling
	  types: - ContactId - 4x1 - 4x2 - High Speed - Super Fast We are
	  also auto-detecting which signaling is being received. So support
	  for those protocols should work out-the-box. Correctly identify
	  ALAW / ULAW calls. Some enhanced protection for broken panels and
	  malicious callers where added. (closes issue ASTERISK-20289)

	  This fixes places in the code that do this. Only the example in

	* Makefile: Test for Asterisk Version info Doxygen uses the

	* main/tcptls.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/tcptls.h:
	  Do not use a FILE handle when doing SIP TCP reads. This is used
	  to solve an issue where a poll on a file descriptor does not
	  necessarily correspond to the readiness of a FILE handle to be
	  read. This change makes it so that for TCP connections, we do a
	  recv() on the file descriptor instead. Because TCP does not
	  guarantee that an entire message or even just one single message
	  will arrive during a read, a loop has been introduced to ensure
	  that we only attempt to handle a single message at a time. The
	  tcptls_session_instance structure has also had an overflow buffer
	  added to it so that if more than one TCP message arrives in one
	  go, there is a place to throw the excess. Huge thanks goes out to
	  Walter Doekes for doing extensive review on this change and
	  finding edge cases where code could fail. (closes issue

	  In addition, it was found that it was impossible to use the
	  Digium Phone Module for Asterisk since it must be loaded before
	  chan_sip since it must hook into chan_sip's configuration

	* main/cdr.c, /: Fix incorrect billing duration reported when batch
	  mode is enabled Similar to r369351, the billing duration can be
	  skewed when batch mode is enabled. This happened much more rarely
	  than the duration, as it only occured when the call was answered
	  (thereby indicating an actual answer time) and immediately hung
	  up on (indicating a billsec of 0). Since a billing time of '0'
	  can either mean that the call immediately ended or that the CDR
	  was improperly answered, we have to use additional information to
	  know whether or not we can trust the CDR billsec value. Prior to
	  this patch, we looked to see if we had a valid answer time. If we
	  did, and billsec was zero, we used the current time to calculate
	  what billsec value we could from the CDR being written. If batch
	  mode is enabled, this will incorrectly report a billsec value
	  being much greater than the actual duration of the call. Instead
	  of relying on the presence of an answer time to know whether or
	  not we can re-calculate the billsec for the CDR, we now also use
	  the presence of the CDR's end time to know if we need to
	  re-calculate or whether we can trust the billsec value that we
	  have. This prevents erroneous jumps in the billsec value, while
	  still making sure that in the worst case, some billing time will
	  be calculated. (closes issue AST-1016) Reported by: Thomas

	  ConfBridge regarding marked, waitmarked, and unmarked users
	  Thank's to Neil Tallim (flan)'s tireless testing, issue
	  reporting, and patches it became clear that app_confbridge had
	  some complex logic in how it handled interactions between marked,
	  waitmarked, and unmarked users. In particular, there were some
	  areas in which the interactions between the users resulted in
	  inconsistent behavior, and app_confbridge was missing logic in
	  how to handle some corner cases. Some areas included: * Poor
	  handling of mixing unmarked and waitmarked users *
	  Inconsistencies in how MOH and muting was applied to various
	  users * Handling of various announcements for different user
	  profile options flan's patches seem to fix the various issues,
	  but highlighted how hard the code could be to maintain. In an
	  attempt to make things easier to maintain and to more fully
	  enumerate the various cases that exist, this patch breaks up the
	  logic into a state machine-like setup. Please note that the
	  various state transitioned are documented on the Asterisk wiki:

	  22 lines Improve AMI long line error handling In AMI's parser,
	  when it receives a long line (> 1024 characters), it discards
	  that line, but continues to process the message normally.
	  Typically, this is not a problem because a) who has lines that
	  long and b) usually a discarded line results in an invalid
	  message. But if that line is specifying an optional field, then
	  the message will be processed, you get a 'Response: Success', but
	  things don't work the way you expected them to. This patch
	  changes the behavior when a line-too-long parse error occurs. *
	  Changes the log message to avoid way-too-long (and truncated
	  anyways) log messages * Adds a 'parsing' status flag to Response:
	  Success * Sets parsing = MESSAGE_LINE_TOO_LONG if, well, a line

	* /, res/res_jabber.c: Check for presence of buddy in info/dinfo
	  handlers The res_jabber resource module uses the ASTOBJ library
	  for managing its ref counted objects. After calling
	  ASTOBJ_CONTAINER_FIND to locate a buddy object, the pointer to
	  the object has to be checked to see if the buddy existed. Prior
	  to this patch, the buddy object was not checked for NULL; with
	  this patch in both aji_client_info_handler and aji_dinfo_handler
	  the pointer is checked before used and, if no buddy object was
	  found, the handlers return an error code. This patch does not
	  take the approach that our JID can be used to log in from another
	  resource. If that approach is desired, an improvement could be
	  made to this patch to create the buddy on the fly. This patch
	  seeks only to prevent Asterisk from crashing. FYI: In Asterisk
	  11+, you really should be using res_xmpp. It does not have this
	  problem, as it moved to the astobj2 library. Note that multiple
	  people have proposed patches for this issue; the patch being
	  committed here is based on those. (closes issue ASTERISK-19532)

	* main/db.c, include/asterisk/astdb.h, /, tests/test_db.c,
	  apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: Support persisting and loading of
	  long member lists. Greenlight in #asterisk brought up that he was
	  receiving an error message "Could not create persistent member
	  string, out of space" when running app_queue in Asterisk 10.
	  dump_queue_members() made an assumption that 8K would be enough
	  to store the generated string, but with queues that have large
	  member lists this is not always the case. This patch removes the
	  limitation and uses ast_str instead of a fixed sized buffer. The
	  complicating factor comes from the fact that ast_db_get requires
	  a buffer and buffer size argument, which doesn't let us pull back
	  more than what we pass in, so I introduced a new
	  ast_db_get_allocated() which returns an ast_strdup()'d copy of
	  the value from astdb. As an aside, I did some testing on the
	  maximum size of data that we can store in the BDB library we
	  distribute and was able to store a 10MB string and retrieve it
	  with no problems, so I feel this is a safe patch. Review:

	  which permits external applications to trigger the refresh
	  themselves. The refresh can apply to a specified mailbox only, an
	  entire context, or all configured mailboxes. Even a refresh
	  performed on every mailbox would not consume as much CPU as the

	  and this only runs on demand. (closes issue ASTERISK-17206)

	  On queue initialisation set queue_avail devstate to INUSE.
	  Previously was unavailable, which indicated an agent was
	  available. 2). When removing members, if there are no other
	  members available, set queue_avail to INUSE. Previously, if a

	  to be removed, particularly when persistant queues is enabled.

	  are set queue_avail to NOT_INUSE. Previously on reloaded, members
	  may have been 'unavailable'. 4). When pausing or unpausing a

	* channels/chan_local.c, /: Fix T.38 support when used with
	  chan_local in between. Users of the T.38 API can indicate
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS on a channel to request that the channel
	  indicate a T.38 negotiation with the parameters present on the
	  channel. The return value of this indication is expected to be
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS upon success but with chan_local involved
	  this could never occur. This fix changes chan_local to always
	  return AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS for this situation. If the
	  underlying channel technology on the other side does not support
	  T.38 this would have been determined ahead of time using
	  ast_channel_get_t38_state and an indication would not occur.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample, channels/sip/include/sip.h, /,
	  channels/chan_sip.c: Properly handle UAC/UAS roles for SIP
	  session timers The SIP session timer mechanism contains a
	  mandatory 'refresher' parameter (included in the Session-Expires

	  within a SIP Invite dialog. It looks like asterisk is
	  interpreting the uac resp. uas role only as the initial role of
	  client and server (caller is uac, callee is uas). The standard
	  rfc 4028 however assigns the client role to the ((RE)-Invite)
	  requester, the server role to the ((RE)-Invite) responder. This
	  patch has Asterisk track the actual refresher as "us" or "them"
	  as opposed to relying on just the configured "uas" or "uac"
	  properties. (closes issue AST-922) Reported by: Thomas Airmont

	* /, res/res_rtp_multicast.c: Fix an issue where a caller to
	  ast_write on a MulticastRTP channel would determine it failed
	  when in reality it did not. When sending RTP packets via
	  multicast the amount of data sent is stored in a variable and
	  returned from the write function. This is incorrect as any
	  non-zero value returned is considered a failure while a return
	  value of 0 is success. For callers (such as ast_streamfile) that
	  checked the return value they would have considered it a failure
	  when in reality nothing went wrong and it was actually a success.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix potential reentrancy problems in
	  chan_sip. Asterisk v1.8 and later was not as vulnerable to this
	  issue. * Made find_call() lock each private as it processes the
	  found dialogs. (Primary cause of ABE-2876) * Made the other
	  functions that traverse the dialogs container lock each private
	  as it examines them. * Fix race condition in sip_call() if the
	  thread that sent the INVITE is held up long enough for a response
	  to be processed. The p->initid for the INVITE retransmission
	  could be added after it was canceled by the response processing.
	  * Made __sip_destroy() clean up resource pointers after freeing.
	  This is primarily defensive in case someone has a stale private
	  pointer. * Removed redundant memset() in reqprep(). The call to
	  init_req() already does the memset() and is the first reference
	  to req in reqprep(). * Removed useless set of req.method in
	  transmit_invite(). The calls to initreqprep() and reqprep() have
	  to do this because they memset() the req. JIRA ABE-2876

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a deadlock caused by a race condition
	  between removing a hint and reloading the dialplan and
	  subscribing to the removed hint. If conditions were right it was
	  possible for both the PBX core and chan_sip to deadlock by both
	  having a lock that the other wants. In the case of the PBX core
	  it had the contexts lock and wanted a SIP dialog lock, while in
	  the case of chan_sip it had the SIP dialog lock and wanted the
	  contexts lock. This fix unlocks the SIP dialog before getting the
	  extension state so that the other thread will not block on trying
	  to lock it. Once the extension state is retrieved the SIP dialog
	  is locked again and life carries on. As the SIP dialog is
	  reference counted it is not possible for it to go away after
	  unlocking. (closes issue ASTERISK-20437) Reported by: jhutchins

	* res/res_format_attr_h264.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix an issue
	  with H.264 format attribute comparison and fix an issue with
	  improper SDP being produced. The H.264 format attribute module
	  compares two format attribute structures to determine if they are
	  compatible or not. In some instances it was possible for this
	  check to determine that both structures were incompatible when
	  they actually should be considered compatible. This check has now
	  been made even more permissive by assuming that if no attribute
	  information is available the two structures are compatible. If
	  both structures contain attribute information a base level
	  comparison of the H.264 IDC value is done to see if they are
	  compatible or not. The above issue uncovered a secondary issue in
	  chan_sip where the SDP being produced would be incorrect if the
	  formats were considered incompatible. This has now been fixed by
	  checking that all information required to produce the SDP is
	  available instead of assuming it is. (closes issue

	* main/libasteriskssl.c, main/tcptls.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c:
	  Resolve memory leaks in TLS initialization and TLS client
	  connections This patch resolves two sources of memory leaks when
	  using TLS in Asterisk: 1) It removes improper initialization (and
	  multiple re-initializations) of portions of the SSL library.
	  Asterisk calls SSL_library_init and SSL_load_error_strings during
	  SSL initialization; collectively this obviates the need for
	  calling any of the following during initialization or client
	  connection handling: * ERR_load_crypto_strings (handled by
	  SSL_load_error_strings) * OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms (synonym for
	  SSL_library_init) * SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms (synonym for
	  SSL_library_init) 2) Failure to completely clean up all memory
	  allocated by Asterisk and by the SSL library for TLS clients.
	  This included not freeing the SSL_CTX object in the SIP channel
	  driver, as well as not clearing the error stack when the TLS
	  client exited. Note that these memory leaks were found by Thomas
	  Arimont, and this patch was essentially written by him with some

	* channels/chan_sip.c: chan_sip: Change SIPQualifyPeer to improve
	  initial response time Prior to this patch, The acknowledgement
	  wasn't produced until after executing the sip_poke_peer action
	  actually responsible for qualifying the peer. Now the response is
	  given immediately once it is known that a peer will be qualified
	  and a SIPqualifypeerdone event is issued when the process is
	  finished. Thanks to OEJ for identifying the problem and helping
	  to come up with a solution. (issue AST-969) Reported by John

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, /: res_rtp_asterisk: Eliminate
	  "type-punned pointer" build warning. Removes
	  "res_rtp_asterisk.c:706: warning: dereferencing type-punned
	  pointer will break strict-aliasing rules" warning from the build
	  on 32-bit platforms. The problem is that 'size' was referenced
	  aliased to both (pj_size_t *) and (pj_ssize_t *). Now just make a
	  copy of size that is the right type so there isn't any pointer
	  aliasing happening. It also adds comments and asserts regarding
	  what looks like an inappropriate use of pj_sock_sendto, but is
	  actually totally fine. (closes issue ASTERISK-20368) Reported by:

	* channels/sip/sdp_crypto.c, /: Only re-create an SRTP session when
	  needed In r356604, SRTP handling was fixed to accomodate multiple
	  crypto keys in an SDP offer and the ability to re-create an SRTP
	  session when the crypto keys changed. In certain circumstances -
	  most notably when a phone is put on hold after having been
	  bridged for a significant amount of time - the act of re-creating
	  the SRTP session causes problems for certain models of phones.
	  The patch committed in r356604 always re-created the SRTP session
	  regardless of whether or not the cryptographic keys changed.
	  Since this is technically not necessary, this patch modifies the
	  behavior to only re-create the SRTP session if Asterisk detects
	  that the remote key has changed. This allows models of phones
	  that do not handle the SRTP session changing to continue to work,
	  while also providing the behavior needed for those phones that do
	  re-negotiate cryptographic keys. (issue ASTERISK-20194) Reported

	* /, apps/app_minivm.c: Fix file descriptor leak and pointer scope
	  issue in MiniVM when sending mail When MiniVM sends an e-mail and
	  it has the volgain option set, it will spawn sox in a separate
	  process to handle the manipulation of the sound file. In doing
	  so, it creates a temporary file. There are two problems here: 1)
	  The file descriptor returned from mkstemp is leaked 2) The
	  finalfilename character pointer points to a buffer that loses
	  scope once volgain processing is finished. Note that in r316265,
	  Russell fixed some gcc warnings by using the return value of the
	  mkstemp call. A warning was placed in minivm that the file
	  descriptor was going to be leaked. This patch reverts that
	  change, as it handles the leak and 'uses' the file descriptor
	  returned from mkstemp. (closes issue ASTERISK-17133) Reported by:

	* channels/sig_pri.c, /: Fix loss of MOH on an ISDN channel when
	  parking a call for the second time. Using the AMI redirect action
	  to take an ISDN call out of a parking lot causes the MOH state to
	  get confused. The redirect action does not take the call off of
	  hold. When the call is subsequently parked again, the call no
	  longer hears MOH. * Make chan_dahdi/sig_pri restart MOH on
	  repeated AST_CONTROL_HOLD frames if it is already in a state
	  where it is supposed to be sending MOH. The MOH may have been
	  stopped by other means. (Such as killing the generator.) This
	  simple fix is done rather than making the AMI redirect action
	  post an AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD unconditionally when it redirects a
	  channel and thus potentially breaking something with an
	  unexpected AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD. (closes issue ABE-2873) Patches:

	* /, pbx/pbx_dundi.c: Fix DUNDi message routing bug when
	  neighboring peer is unreachable Consider a scenario where DUNDi
	  peer PBX1 has two peers that are its neighbors, PBX2 and PBX3,
	  and where PBX2 and PBX3 are also neighbors. If the connection is
	  temporarily broken between PBX1 and PBX3, PBX1 should not include
	  PBX3 in the list of peers it sends to PBX2 in a DPDISCOVER
	  message, as it cannot send messages to PBX3. If it does, PBX2
	  will assume that PBX3 already received the message and fail to
	  forward the message on to PBX3 itself. This patch fixes this by
	  only including peers in a DPDISCOVER message that are reachable
	  by the sending node. This includes all peers with an empty
	  address (00:00:00:00:00:00) and that are have been reached by a
	  qualify message. This patch also prevents attempting to qualify a
	  dynamic peer with an empty address until that peer registers. The
	  patch uploaded by Peter was modified slightly for this commit.

	* /, apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix memory leaks in app_voicemail when
	  using IMAP storage or realtime config This patch fixes two memory
	  leaks: 1. When find_user is called with NULL as its first
	  parameter, the voicemail user returned is allocated on the heap.
	  The inboxcount2 function uses find_user in such a fashion when
	  counting new messages, and fails to free the resulting voicemail
	  user object. 2. When populate_defaults is called on a voicemail
	  user, it wipes whatever flags have been set on the object by
	  copying over the global flags object. If the VM_ALLOCED flag was
	  ste on the voicemail user prior to doing so, that flag is
	  removed. This leaks the voicemail user when free_user is later
	  called. (closes issue ASTERISK-19155) Reported by: Filip Jenicek

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix issue where SIP devices were not

	  second time results in double frees. This failure was seen

	* main/manager.c, /, README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt:
	  AST-2012-012: Resolve AMI User Unauthorized Shell Access through
	  ExternalIVR The AMI Originate action can allow a remote user to
	  specify information that can be used to execute shell commands on
	  the system hosting Asterisk. This can result in an unwanted
	  escalation of permissions, as the Originate action, which
	  requires the "originate" class authorization, can be used to
	  perform actions that would typically require the "system" class
	  authorization. Previous attempts to prevent this permission
	  escalation (AST-2011-006, AST-2012-004) have sought to do so by
	  inspecting the names of applications and functions passed in with
	  the Originate action and, if those applications/functions matched
	  a predefined set of values, rejecting the command if the user
	  lacked the "system" class authorization. As noted by IBM X-Force
	  Research, the "ExternalIVR" application is not listed in the
	  predefined set of values. The solution for this particular
	  vulnerability is to include the "ExternalIVR" application in the
	  set of defined applications/functions that require "system" class
	  authorization. Unfortunately, the approach of inspecting fields
	  in the Originate action against known applications/functions has
	  a significant flaw. The predefined set of values can be bypassed
	  by creative use of the Originate action or by certain dialplan
	  configurations, which is beyond the ability of Asterisk to
	  analyze at run-time. Attempting to work around these scenarios
	  would result in severely restricting the applications or
	  functions and prevent their usage for legitimate means. As such,
	  any additional security vulnerabilities, where an
	  application/function that would normally require the "system"
	  class authorization can be executed by users with the "originate"
	  class authorization, will not be addressed. Instead, the
	  README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file has been updated to
	  reflect that the AMI Originate action can result in commands
	  requiring the "system" class authorization to be executed. Proper
	  system configuration can limit the impact of such scenarios.

	* main/config.c, include/asterisk/lock.h: Add scoped locks to
	  Asterisk. With the SCOPED_LOCK macro, you can create a variable
	  that locks a specific lock and unlocks the lock when the variable
	  goes out of scope. This is useful for situations where many
	  breaks, continues, returns, or other interruptions would require
	  separate unlock statements. With a scoped lock, these aren't
	  necessary. There are specializations for mutexes, read locks,
	  write locks, ao2 locks, ao2 read locks, ao2 write locks, and
	  channel locks. Each of these is a SCOPED_LOCK at heart though.

	* /, res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: Use thread-local storage to store
	  pj_thread_descs. pj_thread_register() takes a parameter of type
	  pj_thread_desc. It was assumed that pj_thread_register either
	  used this item temporarily or made a copy of it. Unfortunately,
	  all it does is keep a pointer to the structure in thread-local
	  storage. This means that if our pj_thread_desc goes out of scope,
	  then pjlib will be referencing bogus data quite often, most
	  commonly on operations involving a pj_mutex_t. In our case, our
	  pj_thread_desc was on the stack and went out of scope very
	  shortly after registering our thread with pjlib. With this
	  change, the pj_thread_desc is stored in thread-local storage so
	  the pointer that pjlib keeps in thread-local storage will
	  reference legitimate memory. (closes issue ASTERISK-20237)

	  channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  main/channel_internal_api.c, main/features.c: Add private
	  representation of caller, connected and redirecting party ids.
	  This patch adds the feature "Private representation of caller,
	  connected and redirecting party ids", as previously discussed
	  with us (DATUS) and Digium. 1. Feature motivation Until now it is
	  quite difficult to modify a party number or name which can only
	  be seen by exactly one particular instantiated technology channel
	  subscriber. One example where a modified party number or name on
	  one channel is spread over several channels are supplementary
	  services like call transfer or pickup. To implement these
	  features Asterisk internally copies caller and connected ids from
	  one channel to another. Another example are extension
	  subscriptions. The monitoring entities (watchers) are notified of
	  state changes and - if desired - of party numbers or names which
	  represent the involving call parties. One major feature where a
	  private representation of party names is essentially needed, i.e.
	  where a party name shall be exclusively signaled to only one
	  particular user, is a private user-specific name resolution for
	  party numbers. A lookup in a private destination-dependent
	  telephone book shall provide party names which cannot be seen by
	  any other user at any time. 2. Feature Description This feature
	  comes along with the implementation of additional private party
	  id elements for caller id, connected id and redirecting ids
	  inside Asterisk channels. The private party id elements can be
	  read or set by the user using Asterisk dialplan functions. When a
	  technology channel is initiating a call, receives an internal
	  connected-line update event, or receives an internal redirecting
	  update event, it merges the corresponding public id with the
	  private id to create an effective party id. The effective party
	  id is then used for protocol signaling. The channel technologies
	  which initially support the private id representation with this
	  patch are SIP (chan_sip), mISDN (chan_misdn) and PRI
	  (chan_dahdi). Once a private name or number on a channel is set
	  and (implicitly) made valid, it is generally used for any further
	  protocol signaling until it is rewritten or invalidated. To
	  simplify the invalidation of private ids all internally generated
	  connected/redirecting update events and also all
	  connected/redirecting update events which are generated by
	  technology channels -- receiving regarding protocol information -
	  automatically trigger the invalidation of private ids. If not
	  using the private party id representation feature at all, i.e. if
	  using only the 'regular' caller-id, connected and redirecting
	  related functions, the current characteristic of Asterisk is not
	  affected by the new extended functionality. 3. User interface
	  Description To grant access to the private name and number
	  representation from the Asterisk dialplan, the CALLERID,
	  CONNECTEDLINE and REDIRECTING dialplan functions are extended by
	  the following data types. The formats of these data types are
	  equal to the corresponding regular 'non-private' already existing
	  data types: CALLERID: priv-all priv-name priv-name-valid
	  priv-name-charset priv-name-pres priv-num priv-num-valid
	  priv-num-plan priv-num-pres priv-subaddr priv-subaddr-valid
	  priv-subaddr-type priv-subaddr-odd priv-tag CONNECTEDLINE:
	  priv-name priv-name-valid priv-name-pres priv-name-charset
	  priv-num priv-num-valid priv-num-pres priv-num-plan priv-subaddr
	  priv-subaddr-valid priv-subaddr-type priv-subaddr-odd priv-tag
	  REDIRECTING: priv-orig-name priv-orig-name-valid
