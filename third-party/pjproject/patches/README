The 0000-* patches in this directory should not be removed or
reordered when upgrading to a new version of pjproject.  They
MAY need to be updated to apply cleanly however.

New patches should be numbered in ascending order with no
duplicates.  Leave 10 slots open after the last patch to
allow others to be inserted.
