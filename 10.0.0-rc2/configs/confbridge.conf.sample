;denoise=yes ; Sets whether or not a denoise filter should be applied

;pin=1234  ; Sets if this user must enter a PIN number before entering

;announce_join_leave=yes ; When enabled, this option will prompt the user for a

;internal_sample_rate=auto     ; Sets the internal native sample rate the

                        ; be chosen.  Using a larger mixing interval comes at the cost of introducing
                        ; larger amounts of delay into the bridge.  Valid values here are 10, 20, 40,
                        ; or 80.  By default 20ms is used.

;video_mode = follow_talker; Sets how confbridge handles video distribution to the conference participants.

; --- ConfBridge Menu Options ---
; The ConfBridge application also has the ability to
; apply custom DTMF menus to each channel using the
; application.  Like the User and Bridge profiles
; a menu is passed in to ConfBridge as an argument in
; the dialplan.
;
; Below is a list of menu actions that can be assigned
; to a DTMF sequence.
;
; A single DTMF sequence can have multiple actions associated with it. This is
; accomplished by stringing the actions together and using a ',' as the delimiter.
; Example:  Both listening and talking volume is reset when '5' is pressed.
; 5=reset_talking_volume, reset_listening_volume
;
; playback(<name of audio file>&<name of audio file>)

; no_op ; This action does nothing (No Operation). Its only real purpose exists for
        ; being able to reserve a sequence in the config as a menu exit sequence.
; decrease_listening_volume ; Decreases the channel's listening volume.
; increase_listening_volume ; Increases the channel's listening volume.
