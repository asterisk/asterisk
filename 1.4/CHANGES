    * Removed Codecs/Channels:
         1. codec_g723 was removed because the actual codec implementation it was designed to use is not distributable
         2. chan_modem_* and related modules are gone because the kernel support for those interfaces is old, buggy and unsupported
    * New Utils:
         1. aelparse -- compile .ael files outside of asterisk
    * New manager events:
         1. OriginateResponse event comes to replace OriginateSuccess and OriginateFailure
    * iLBC source code no longer included (see UPGRADE.txt for details)
	* New CLI command "pri show version" that shows the current version of libpri
	  that the library was built against (requires a version of libpri since this API
	  feature was added).
