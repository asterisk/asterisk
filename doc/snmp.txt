Asterisk SNMP Support
---------------------

Rudimentary support for SNMP access to Asterisk is available.  To build
this, one needs to have Net-SNMP development headers and libraries on
the build system, including any libraries Net-SNMP depends on.

Note that on some (many?) Linux-distributions the dependency list in
the net-snmp-devel list is not complete, and additional RPMs will need
to be installed.  This is typically seen as attempts to build res_snmp
as net-snmp-devel is available, but then failures to find certain
libraries.

SNMP support comes in two varieties -- as a sub-agent to a running SNMP
daemon using the AgentX protocol, or as a full standalone agent.  If
you wish to run a full standalone agent, Asterisk must run as root in
order to find to port 161.

Configuring access when running as a full agent is something that is
left as an exercise to the reader.

To enable access to the Asterisk SNMP subagent from a master SNMP
daemon, one will need to enable AgentX support, and also make sure that
Asterisk will be able to access the Unix domain socket.  One way of
doing this is to add the following to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:

	# Enable AgentX support
	master agentx

	# Set permissions on AgentX socket and containing
	# directory such that process in group 'asterisk'
	# will be able to connect
	agentXPerms  0660 0550 nobody asterisk

This assumes that you run Asterisk under group 'asterisk' (and does
not care what user you run as).
