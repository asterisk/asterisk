Followme is now realtime-enabled:

To use, you must define two backend data structures, with the following fields:

followme:
	name                Name of this followme entry.  Specified when invoking the FollowMe
	                    application in the dialplan.  This field is the only one which is
	                    mandatory.  All of the other fields will inherit the default from
	                    followme.conf, if not specified in this data resource.
	musicclass OR       The musiconhold class used for the caller while waiting to be
	musiconhold OR      connected.
    music
	context             Dialplan context from which to dial numbers
	takecall            DTMF used to accept the call and be connected.  For obvious reasons,
	                    this needs to be a single digit, '*', or '#'.
	declinecall         DTMF used to refuse the call, sending it onto the next step, if any.
	call_from_prompt    Prompt to play to the callee, announcing the call.
	norecording_prompt  The alternate prompt to play to the callee, when the caller
	                    refuses to leave a name (or the option isn't set to allow them).
	options_prompt      Normally, "press 1 to accept, 2 to decline".
	hold_prompt         Message played to the caller while dialing the followme steps.
	status_prompt       Normally, "Party is not at their desk".
	sorry_prompt        Normally, "Unable to locate party".

followme_numbers:
	name                Name of this followme entry.  Must match the name above.
	ordinal             An integer, specifying the order in which these numbers will be
	                    followed.
	phonenumber         The telephone number(s) you would like to call, separated by '&'.
	timeout             Timeout associated with this step.  See the followme documentation
	                    for more information on how this value is handled.
