Subject: test.c

The "tests" attribute of the "testsuite" element in the
output XML now reflects only the tests actually requested
to be executed instead of all the tests registered.

The "failures" attribute was added to the "testsuite"
element.

Also added two new unit tests that just pass and fail
to be used for testing CI itself.
