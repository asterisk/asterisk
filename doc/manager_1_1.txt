* NEW EVENTS
------------

- Event: Transfer
	Modules: res_features, chan_sip
	Purpose:
		Inform about call transfer, linking transferer with transfer target
		You should be able to trace the call flow with this missing piece
		of information. If it works out well, the "Transfer" event should
		be followed by a "Bridge" event
		The transfermethod: header informs if this is a pbx core transfer
		or something done on channel driver level. For SIP, check the example:
	Example:
		
		Event: Transfer
		Privilege: call,all
		TransferMethod: SIP
		TransferType: Blind
		Channel: SIP/device1-01849800
		SIP-Callid: 091386f505842c87016c4d93195ec67d@127.0.0.1
		TargetChannel: SIP/device2-01841200
		TransferExten: 100
		TransferContext: default

- Event: ChannelUpdate
	Modules: chan_sip.c, chan_iax2.c

		OldAccountCode: OllesAccount 12345

- Event: ModuleLoadReport
	Modules: loader.c
	Purpose: To report that module loading is complete. Some aggressive
		clients connect very quickly to AMI and needs to know when
		all manager events embedded in modules are loaded
		Also, if this does not happen, something is seriously wrong.
		This could happen to chan_sip and other modules using DNS.
	Example:
		Event: ModuleLoad
		ModuleLoadStatus: Done
		ModuleSelection: All
		ModuleCount: 24

- Event: QueueSummary
	Modules: app_queue

		Member: SIP/1000

- Event: RegistryEntry
	Modules: chan_sip
	Purpose: Reports the state of the SIP registrations. This event is generated by
                issuing a QueueSummary AMI action.

		Host: sip.myvoipprovider.com
		Port: 5060
		Username: guestuser
		Refresh: 105
