	--- VIDEO CONSOLE SUPPORT IN ASTERISK ---

Some console drivers (at the moment chan_oss.so) can be built with
support for sending and receiving video.  In order to have this
working you need to perform the following steps:

+++ Enable building the video_console support +++

    The simplest way to do it is add this one line to channels/Makefile:

    chan_oss.so: _ASTCFLAGS+=-DHAVE_VIDEO_CONSOLE

+++ Install prerequisite packages +++

  The video_console support relies on the presence of SDL, SDL_image
  and ffmpeg libraries, and of course on the availability of X11

  On Linux, these are supplied by

	libncurses-dev,
	libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl-image1.2-dev
	libavcodec-dev, libswcale-dev

  On FreeBSD, you need the following ports:

	multimedia/ffmpeg (2007.10.04)
	devel/sdl12  graphics/sdl_image

+++ Build and install asterisk with all the above +++

  Make sure you do a 'make clean' and run configure again after you
  have installed the required packages, to make sure that the required
  pieces are found.
    Check that chan_oss.so is generated and correctly installed.

+++ Update configuration files +++

  Video support requires explicit configuration as described below:
  == oss.conf ==
    You need to set various parameters for video console, the easiest
    way is to uncomment the following line in oss.conf by removing the
    leading ';'

	;[general](+,my_video,skin2)

    You also need to manually copy the two files

	images/kpad2.jpg images/font.png

    into the places specified in oss.conf, which in the sample are set to

	    keypad = /tmp/kpad2.jpg
	    keypad_font = /tmp/font.png

    other configuration parameters are described in oss.conf.sample

  == sip.conf ==
    To actually run a call using SIP (the same probably applies to iax.conf)
    you need to enable video support as following

        [general](+)
                videosupport=yes
                allow=h263      ; this or other video formats   
                allow=h263p     ; this or other video formats

    you can add other video formats e.g. h261, h264, mpeg if they are
    supported by your version of libavcodec.


+++ RUN THE PROGRAM +++

   run asterisk in console mode e.g. asterisk -vdc

   If video console support has been successfully compiled in, then
   you will see the "console startgui" command available on the CLI`
   interface. Run the command, and you should see a window like this:

	http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/asterisk_video_console.jpg

   To exit from this window, in the console run "console stopgui".
   If you want to start a video call, you need to configure your dialplan
   so that you can reach (or be reachable) by a peer who can support video.
   Once done, a video call is the same as an ordinary call:
   "console dial ...", "console answer", "console hangup" all work the same.
   To use the GUI, and also configure video sources, see the next section.

+++ VIDEO SOURCES +++

  Video sources are declared with the "videodevice=..." lines in oss.conf
  where the ... is the name of a device (e.g. /dev/video0 ...) or a
  string starting with X11 which identifies one instance of an X11 grabber.
  You can have up to 9 sources, displayed in thumbnails in the gui, and
  select which one to transmit, possibly using Picture-in-Picture.

  For webcams, the only control you have is the image size and frame
  rate (which at the moment is the same for all video sources).
  X11 grabbers capture a region of the X11 screen (it can contain
  anything, even a live video) and use it as the source.
  The position of the grab region can be configured using the GUI below
  independently for each video source.

  The actual video sent to the remote side is the device selected as
  "primary" (with the mouse, see below), possibly with a small
  'Picture-in-Picture' of the "secondary" device (all selectable
  with the mouse).

+++ GUI COMMANDS AND VIDEO SOURCES +++

(most of the text below is taken from channels/console_gui.c)

The GUI is made of 4 areas: remote video on the left, local video
on the right, keypad with all controls and text windows in the
center, and source device thumbnails on the top.  The top row is
not displayed if no devices are specified in the config file.

The central section is built using an image (jpg, png, maybe gif too)
for the skin and other GUI elements.  Comments embedded in the image
indicate to what function each area is mapped to.
Another image (png with transparency) is used for the font.

Mouse and keyboard events are detected on the whole surface, and
handled differently according to their location:
- center/right click on the local/remote window are used to resize
  the corresponding window;
- clicks on the thumbnail start/stop sources and select them as
  primary or secondary video sources;
- drag on the local video window are used to move the captured
  area (in the case of X11 grabber) or the picture-in-picture position;
- keystrokes on the keypad are mapped to the corresponding key;
  keystrokes are used as keypad functions, or as text input
  if we are in text-input mode.
- drag on some keypad areas (sliders etc.) are mapped to the
  corresponding functions (mute/unmute audio and video,
  enable/disable Picture-in-Picture, freeze the incoming video,
  dial numbers, pick up or hang up a call, ...)
