  \brief Defines a structure to be used to hold a list of specified type (with no lock).
  \param name This will be the name of the defined structure.
  \param type This is the type of each list entry.

  This macro creates a structure definition that can be used
  to hold a list of the entries of type \a type. It does not actually
  declare (allocate) a structure; to do that, either follow this
  macro with the desired name of the instance you wish to declare,
  or use the specified \a name to declare instances elsewhere.

  Example usage:
  \code
  static AST_LIST_HEAD_NOLOCK(entry_list, entry) entries;
  \endcode

  This would define \c struct \c entry_list, and declare an instance of it named
  \a entries, all intended to hold a list of type \c struct \c entry.

  \param field This is the name of the field (declared using AST_LIST_ENTRY())

  This macro is use to loop over (traverse) the entries in a list. It uses a
  \a for loop, and supplies the enclosed code with a pointer to each list
  entry as it loops. It is typically used as follows:
  \code
  static AST_LIST_HEAD(entry_list, list_entry) entries;
  ...
  struct list_entry {
  	...
  	AST_LIST_ENTRY(list_entry) list;

     (do something with current here)
  }
  \endcode
  \warning If you modify the forward-link pointer contained in the \a current entry while
  inside the loop, the behavior will be unpredictable. At a minimum, the following
  macros will modify the forward-link pointer, and should not be used inside
  AST_LIST_TRAVERSE() against the entry pointed to by the \a current pointer without
  careful consideration of their consequences:
  \li AST_LIST_NEXT() (when used as an lvalue)
  \li AST_LIST_INSERT_AFTER()
  \li AST_LIST_INSERT_HEAD()
  \li AST_LIST_INSERT_TAIL()
