/*

  Calling sequence:

  Call create_lpc10_encoder_state(), which returns a pointer to an
  already initialized lpc10_encoder_state structure.

  lpc10_encode reads indices 0 through (LPC10_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME-1) of
  array speech[], and writes indices 0 through
  (LPC10_BITS_IN_COMPRESSED_FRAME-1) of array bits[], and both reads
  and writes the lpc10_encoder_state structure contents.  The
  lpc10_encoder_state structure should *not* be initialized for every
  frame of encoded speech.  Once at the beginning of execution, done
  automatically for you by create_lpc10_encoder_state(), is enough.

  init_lpc10_encoder_state() reinitializes the lpc10_encoder_state
  structure.  This might be useful if you are finished processing one
  sound sample, and want to reuse the same lpc10_encoder_state
  structure to process another sound sample.  There might be other
  uses as well.

  Note that the comments in the lpc10/lpcenc.c file imply that indices
  1 through 180 of array speech[] are read.  These comments were
  written for the Fortran version of the code, before it was
  automatically converted to C by the conversion program f2c.  f2c
  seems to use the convention that the pointers to arrays passed as
  function arguments point to the first index used in the Fortran
  code, whatever index that might be (usually 1), and then it modifies
  the pointer inside of the function, like so:

  if (speech) {
      --speech;
  }

  So that the code can access the first value at index 1 and the last
  at index 180.  This makes the translated C code "closer" to the
  original Fortran code.

  The calling sequence for the decoder is similar to the encoder.  The
  only significant difference is that the array bits[] is read
  (indices 0 through (LPC10_BITS_IN_COMPRESSED_FRAME-1)), and the
  array speech[] is written (indices 0 through
  (LPC10_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME-1)).
