.TH ASTGENKEY 8 "May 14th, 2005" "Asterisk" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
.B astgenkey \- generates keys for for Asterisk IAX2 RSA authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP 
.B astgenkey
[ \-q ] [ \-n ] [ \fIkeyname\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B astgenkey 
This script generates an RSA private and public key pair in PEM format 
for use by Asterisk.  The private key should be kept a secret, as it can 
be used to fake your system's identity.  Thus by default (without the 
option 
.I \-n
) the script will create a passphrase-encrypted copy of your secret key: 
without entering the passphrase you won't be able to use it. 

However if you want to use such a key with Asterisk, you'll have to start 
it interactively, because the scripts that start asterisk can't use that
encrypted key.

The key is identified by a name. If you don't write the name on the 
command-line you'll be prompted for one. The outputs of the script are:

.I name\fB.pub
.RS
The public key: not secret. Send this to the other side.
.RE

.I name\fB.key
.RS
The private key: secret.
.RE

Those files should be copied to 
.I /var/lib/asterisk/keys

(The private key: on your system. The public key: on other systems)

To see the currently-installed keys from the asterisk CLI, use the command

.RS
show keys
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.B \-q
.RS
Run quietly.
.RE

.B \-n
.RS
Don't encrypt the private key.
.RE

.SH SECURITY
The keys are created, using the umask of the user running the command.
To create the keys in a secure manner, you should check to ensure that
your umask is first set to disallow the private key from being world-
readable, such as with the following commands:

.I umask 0066

.I astgenkey yourkey

And then make the key accessible to Asterisk (assuming you run it as
user "asterisk").

  chown asterisk /var/lib/asterisk/keys/yourname.*
