NAME
	$prog - Dump and/or format asterisk coredump files

SYNOPSIS
	$prog [ --help ] [ --running | --RUNNING ] [ --latest ]
		[ --tarball-coredumps ] [ --delete-coredumps-after ]
		[ --tarball-results ] [ --delete-results-after ]
		[ --no-default-search ] [ --append-coredumps ]
		[ <coredump> | <pattern> ... ]

DESCRIPTION

	Extracts backtraces and lock tables from Asterisk coredump files.
	For each coredump found, 4 new result files are created:
	- <coredump>.brief.txt: The output of "thread apply all bt".

	- <coredump>.thread1.txt: The output of "thread apply 1 bt full".

	- <coredump>.full.txt: The output of "thread apply all bt full".

	- <coredump>.locks.txt: If asterisk was compiled with
		"DEBUG_THREADS", this file will contain a dump of the locks
		table similar to doing a "core show locks" from the asterisk
		CLI.

	Optional features:
	- The running asterisk process can be suspended and dumped.
	- The coredumps can be merged into a tarball.
	- The coredumps can be deleted after processing.
	- The results files can be merged into a tarball.
	- The results files can be deleted after processing.

	Options:

	--help
		Print this help.

	--running
		Create a coredump from the running asterisk instance and
		process it along with any other coredumps found (if any).
		WARNING: This WILL interrupt call processing.  You will be
		asked to confirm.

	--RUNNING
		Same as --running but without the confirmation prompt.
		DANGEROUS!!

	--latest
		Process only the latest coredump from those specified (based
		on last-modified time).  If a dump of the running process was
		requested, it is always included in addition to the latest
		from the existing coredumps.

	--tarball-coredumps
		Creates a gzipped tarball of all coredumps processed.
		The tarball name will be:
		/tmp/asterisk.<timestamp>.coredumps.tar.gz

	--delete-coredumps-after
		Deletes all processed coredumps regardless of whether
		a tarball was created.

	--tarball-results
		Creates a gzipped tarball of all result files produced.
		The tarball name will be:
		/tmp/asterisk.<timestamp>.results.tar.gz

	--delete-results-after
		Deletes all processed results regardless of whether
		a tarball was created.  It probably doesn't make sense
		to use this option unless you have also specified
		--tarball-results.

	--no-default-search
		Ignore COREDUMPS from the config files and process only
		coredumps listed on the command line (if any) and/or
		the running asterisk instance (if requested).

	--append-coredumps
		Append any coredumps specified on the command line to the
		config file specified ones instead of overriding them.

	<coredump> | <pattern>
		A list of coredumps or coredump search patterns.  Unless
		--append-coredumps was specified, these entries will override
		those specified in the config files.

		Any resulting file that isn't actually a coredump is silently
		ignored.  If your patterns contains spaces be sure to only
		quote the portion of the pattern that DOESN'T contain wildcard
		expressions.  If you quote the whole pattern, it won't be
		expanded.

		If --no-default-search is specified and no files are specified
		on the command line, then the only the running asterisk process
		will be dumped (if requested).  Otherwise if no files are
		specified on the command line the value of COREDUMPS from
		ast_debug_tools.conf will be used.  Failing that, the following
		patterns will be used:
		/tmp/core[-._]asterisk!(*.txt)
		/tmp/core[-._]\$(hostname)!(*.txt)

NOTES
	The script relies on not only bash, but also recent GNU date and
	gdb with python support.  *BSD operating systems may require
	installation of the 'coreutils' and 'devel/gdb' packagess and minor
	tweaking of the ast_debug_tools.conf file.

	Any files output will have ':' characters changed to '-'.  This is
	to facilitate uploading those files to Jira which doesn't like the
	colons.

FILES
	/etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf
	~/ast_debug_tools.conf
	./ast_debug_tools.conf

	#
	# This file is used by the Asterisk debug tools.
	# Unlike other Asterisk config files, this one is
	# "sourced" by bash and must adhere to bash semantics.
	#

	# A list of coredumps and/or coredump search patterns.
	# Bash extended globs are enabled and any resulting files
	# that aren't actually coredumps are silently ignored
	# so you can be liberal with the globs.
	#
	# If your patterns contains spaces be sure to only quote
	# the portion of the pattern that DOESN'T contain wildcard
	# expressions.  If you quote the whole pattern, it won't
	# be expanded and the glob characters will be treated as
	# literals.
	#
	# The exclusion of files ending ".txt" is just for
	# demonstration purposes as non-coredumps will be ignored
	# anyway.
	COREDUMPS=(/tmp/core[-._]asterisk!(*.txt) /tmp/core[-._]\$(hostname)!(*.txt))

	# Date command for the "running" coredump and tarballs.
	# DATEFORMAT will be executed to get the timestamp.
	# Don't put quotes around the format string or they'll be
	# treated as literal characters.  Also be aware of colons
	# in the output as you can't upload files with colons in
	# the name to Jira.
	#
	# Unix timestamp
	#DATEFORMAT='date +%s.%N'
	#
	# *BSD/MacOS doesn't support %N but after installing GNU
	# coreutils...

	# Readable GMT
	#DATEFORMAT='date -u +%FT%H-%M-%S%z'
