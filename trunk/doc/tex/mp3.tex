\subsubsection{MP3 Music On Hold}

Use of the mpg123 for your music on hold is no longer recommended and is now
officially deprecated.  You should now use one of the native formats for your
music on hold selections.

However, if you still need to use mp3 as your music on hold format, a format
driver for reading MP3 audio files is available in the asterisk-addons SVN
repository on svn.digium.com or in the asterisk-addons release at
\url{http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/asterisk/}.
