===========================================================

New in 16.0.0:

app_fax:
 - The app_fax module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module res_fax.

app_macro:
 - The app_macro module is now deprecated and by default it is no longer
   built.  Users should migrate to app_stack (Gosub).  A warning is logged
   the first time any Macro is used.

AMI:
 - The ContactStatus and Status fields for the manager events ContactStatus
   and ContactStatusDetail are now set to "NonQualified" when a contact exists
   but has not been qualified.

ARI:
 - The ContactInfo event's contact_status field is now set to "NonQualified"
   when a contact exists but has not been qualified.

Build System:
 - MALLOC_DEBUG no longer has an effect on Asterisk's ABI.  Asterisk built
   with MALLOC_DEBUG can now successfully load binary modules built without
   MALLOC_DEBUG and vice versa.  Third-party pre-compiled modules no longer
   need to have a special build with it enabled.

 - Asterisk now depends on libjansson >= 2.11.  If this version is not
   available on your distro you can use `./configure --with-jansson-bundled`.

chan_dahdi:
 - Timeouts for reading digits from analog phones are now configurable in
   chan_dahdi.conf: firstdigit_timeout, interdigit_timeout, matchdigit_timeout.

cdr_syslog:
 - The cdr_syslog module is now deprecated and by default it is no longer
   built.

res_config_sqlite:
 - The res_config_sqlite module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module res_config_sqlite3.

res_monitor:
 - The res_monitor module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module app_mixmonitor.

Core:
 - libedit is no longer available as an embedded library and must be provided
   by the system.
