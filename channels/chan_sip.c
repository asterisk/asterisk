 * \brief Implementation of Session Initiation Protocol
 *
 * \author Mark Spencer <markster@digium.com>
 *
 * See Also:
 * \arg \ref AstCREDITS
 *
 * Implementation of RFC 3261 - without S/MIME, and experimental TCP and TLS support
 * Configuration file \link Config_sip sip.conf \endlink
 *
 * ********** IMPORTANT *
 * \note TCP/TLS support is EXPERIMENTAL and WILL CHANGE. This applies to configuration
 *	settings, dialplan commands and dialplans apps/functions
 * See \ref sip_tcp_tls
 * 
 *
 * ******** General TODO:s
 * \todo Better support of forking
 * \todo VIA branch tag transaction checking
 * \todo Transaction support
 * 
 * ******** Wishlist: Improvements
 * - Support of SIP domains for devices, so that we match on username@domain in the From: header
 * - Connect registrations with a specific device on the incoming call. It's not done
 *   automatically in Asterisk
 *
 * \ingroup channel_drivers
 *
 * \par Overview of the handling of SIP sessions
 * The SIP channel handles several types of SIP sessions, or dialogs,
 * not all of them being "telephone calls".
 * - Incoming calls that will be sent to the PBX core
 * - Outgoing calls, generated by the PBX
 * - SIP subscriptions and notifications of states and voicemail messages
 * - SIP registrations, both inbound and outbound
 * - SIP peer management (peerpoke, OPTIONS)
 * - SIP text messages
 *
 * In the SIP channel, there's a list of active SIP dialogs, which includes
 * all of these when they are active. "sip show channels" in the CLI will
 * show most of these, excluding subscriptions which are shown by
 * "sip show subscriptions"
 *
 * \par incoming packets
 * Incoming packets are received in the monitoring thread, then handled by
 * sipsock_read() for udp only. In tcp, packets are read by the tcp_helper thread.
 * sipsock_read() function parses the packet and matches an existing
 * dialog or starts a new SIP dialog.
 * 
 * sipsock_read sends the packet to handle_incoming(), that parses a bit more.
 * If it is a response to an outbound request, the packet is sent to handle_response().
 * If it is a request, handle_incoming() sends it to one of a list of functions
 * depending on the request type - INVITE, OPTIONS, REFER, BYE, CANCEL etc
 * sipsock_read locks the ast_channel if it exists (an active call) and
 * unlocks it after we have processed the SIP message.
 *
 * A new INVITE is sent to handle_request_invite(), that will end up
 * starting a new channel in the PBX, the new channel after that executing
 * in a separate channel thread. This is an incoming "call".
 * When the call is answered, either by a bridged channel or the PBX itself
 * the sip_answer() function is called.
 *
 * The actual media - Video or Audio - is mostly handled by the RTP subsystem
 * in rtp.c 
 * 
 * \par Outbound calls
 * Outbound calls are set up by the PBX through the sip_request_call()
 * function. After that, they are activated by sip_call().
 * 
 * \par Hanging up
 * The PBX issues a hangup on both incoming and outgoing calls through
 * the sip_hangup() function
 */

/*!  
 * \page sip_tcp_tls SIP TCP and TLS support
 * 
 * \par tcpfixes TCP implementation changes needed
 * \todo Fix TCP/TLS handling in dialplan, SRV records, transfers and much more
 * \todo Save TCP/TLS sessions in registry
 *	If someone registers a SIPS uri, this forces us to set up a TLS connection back.
 * \todo Add TCP/TLS information to function SIPPEER and SIPCHANINFO
 * \todo If tcpenable=yes, we must open a TCP socket on the same address as the IP for UDP.
 * 	 The tcpbindaddr config option should only be used to open ADDITIONAL ports
 * 	 So we should propably go back to
 *		bindaddr= the default address to bind to. If tcpenable=yes, then bind this to both udp and TCP
 *				if tlsenable=yes, open TLS port (provided we also have cert)
 *		tcpbindaddr = extra address for additional TCP connections
 *		tlsbindaddr = extra address for additional TCP/TLS connections
 *		udpbindaddr = extra address for additional UDP connections
 *			These three options should take multiple IP/port pairs
 *	Note: Since opening additional listen sockets is a *new* feature we do not have today
 *		the XXXbindaddr options needs to be disabled until we have support for it
 *		
 * \todo re-evaluate the transport= setting in sip.conf. This is right now not well
 * 	thought of. If a device in sip.conf contacts us via TCP, we should not switch transport,
 *	even if udp is the configured first transport.
 *	
 * \todo Be prepared for one outbound and another incoming socket per pvt. This applies
 *       specially to communication with other peers (proxies).
 * \todo We need to test TCP sessions with SIP proxies and in regards
 *       to the SIP outbound specs.
 * \todo ;transport=tls was deprecated in RFC3261 and should not be used at all. See section 26.2.2.
 *
 * \todo If the message is smaller than the given Content-length, the request should get a 400 Bad request
 *       message. If it's a response, it should be dropped. (RFC 3261, Section 18.3)
 * \todo Since we have had multidomain support in Asterisk for quite a while, we need to support
 *       multiple domains in our TLS implementation, meaning one socket and one cert per domain
 * \todo Selection of transport for a request needs to be done after we've parsed all route headers,
 *	 also considering outbound proxy options.
 *		First request: Outboundproxy, routes, (reg contact or URI. If URI doesn't have port:  DNS naptr, srv, AAA)
 *		Intermediate requests: Outboundproxy(only when forced), routes, contact/uri
 *	DNS naptr support is crucial. A SIP uri might lead to a TLS connection.
 *	Also note that due to outbound proxy settings, a SIPS uri might have to be sent on UDP (not to recommend though)
 * \todo Default transports are set to UDP, which cause the wrong behaviour when contacting remote
 *	devices directly from the dialplan. UDP is only a fallback if no other method works,
 *	in order to be compatible with RFC2543 (SIP/1.0) devices. For transactions that exceed the
 * 	MTU (like INIVTE with video, audio and RTT)  TCP should be preferred.
 *
 *	When dialling unconfigured peers (with no port number)  or devices in external domains
 *	NAPTR records MUST be consulted to find configured transport. If they are not found,
 *	SRV records for both TCP and UDP should be checked. If there's a record for TCP, use that.
 *	If there's no record for TCP, then use UDP as a last resort. If there's no SRV records,
 *	\note this only applies if there's no outbound proxy configured for the session. If an outbound
 *	proxy is configured, these procedures might apply for locating the proxy and determining
 *	the transport to use for communication with the proxy.
 * \par Other bugs to fix ----
 * __set_address_from_contact(const char *fullcontact, struct sockaddr_in *sin, int tcp)
 *	- sets TLS port as default for all TCP connections, unless other port is given in contact.
 * parse_register_contact(struct sip_pvt *pvt, struct sip_peer *peer, struct sip_request *req)
 *	- assumes that the contact the UA registers is using the same transport as the REGISTER request, which is 
 *	  a bad guess.
 *      - Does not save any information about TCP/TLS connected devices, which is a severe BUG, as discussed on the mailing list.
 * get_destination(struct sip_pvt *p, struct sip_request *oreq)
 *	- Doesn't store the information that we got an incoming SIPS request in the channel, so that
 *	  we can require a secure signalling path OUT of Asterisk (on SIP or IAX2). Possibly, the call should
 *	  fail on in-secure signalling paths if there's no override in our configuration. At least, provide a
 *	  channel variable in the dialplan.
 * get_refer_info(struct sip_pvt *transferer, struct sip_request *outgoing_req)
 *	- As above, if we have a SIPS: uri in the refer-to header
 * 	- Does not check transport in refer_to uri.

/*!  \page sip_session_timers SIP Session Timers in Asterisk Chan_sip

	The SIP Session-Timers is an extension of the SIP protocol that allows end-points and proxies to
	refresh a session periodically. The sessions are kept alive by sending a RE-INVITE or UPDATE
	request at a negotiated interval. If a session refresh fails then all the entities that support Session-
	Timers clear their internal session state. In addition, UAs generate a BYE request in order to clear
	the state in the proxies and the remote UA (this is done for the benefit of SIP entities in the path
	that do not support Session-Timers).

	The Session-Timers can be configured on a system-wide, per-user, or per-peer basis. The peruser/
	per-peer settings override the global settings. The following new parameters have been
	added to the sip.conf file.
		session-timers=["accept", "originate", "refuse"]
		session-expires=[integer]
		session-minse=[integer]
		session-refresher=["uas", "uac"]

	The session-timers parameter in sip.conf defines the mode of operation of SIP session-timers feature in
	Asterisk. The Asterisk can be configured in one of the following three modes:

	1. Accept :: In the "accept" mode, the Asterisk server honors session-timers requests
		made by remote end-points. A remote end-point can request Asterisk to engage
		session-timers by either sending it an INVITE request with a "Supported: timer"
		header in it or by responding to Asterisk's INVITE with a 200 OK that contains
		Session-Expires: header in it. In this mode, the Asterisk server does not 
		request session-timers from remote end-points. This is the default mode.
	2. Originate :: In the "originate" mode, the Asterisk server requests the remote 
		end-points to activate session-timers in addition to honoring such requests
		made by the remote end-pints. In order to get as much protection as possible
		against hanging SIP channels due to network or end-point failures, Asterisk
		resends periodic re-INVITEs even if a remote end-point does not support
		the session-timers feature.
	3. Refuse :: In the "refuse" mode, Asterisk acts as if it does not support session-
		timers for inbound or outbound requests. If a remote end-point requests
		session-timers in a dialog, then Asterisk ignores that request unless it's
		noted as a requirement (Require: header), in which case the INVITE is 
		rejected with a 420 Bad Extension response.

/*! \brief Handle incoming REFER request */
/*! \page SIP_REFER SIP transfer Support (REFER)

	REFER is used for call transfer in SIP. We get a REFER
	to place a new call with an INVITE somwhere and then
	keep the transferor up-to-date of the transfer. If the
	transfer fails, get back on line with the orginal call. 

	- REFER can be sent outside or inside of a dialog.
	  Asterisk only accepts REFER inside of a dialog.

	- If we get a replaces header, it is an attended transfer

	\par Blind transfers
	The transferor provides the transferee
	with the transfer targets contact. The signalling between
	transferer or transferee should not be cancelled, so the
	call is recoverable if the transfer target can not be reached 
	by the transferee.

	In this case, Asterisk receives a TRANSFER from
	the transferor, thus is the transferee. We should
	try to set up a call to the contact provided
	and if that fails, re-connect the current session.
	If the new call is set up, we issue a hangup.
	In this scenario, we are following section 5.2
	in the SIP CC Transfer draft. (Transfer without
	a GRUU)

	\par Transfer with consultation hold
	In this case, the transferor
	talks to the transfer target before the transfer takes place.
	This is implemented with SIP hold and transfer.
	Note: The invite From: string could indicate a transfer.
	(Section 6. Transfer with consultation hold)
	The transferor places the transferee on hold, starts a call
	with the transfer target to alert them to the impending
	transfer, terminates the connection with the target, then
	proceeds with the transfer (as in Blind transfer above)

	\par Attended transfer
	The transferor places the transferee
	on hold, calls the transfer target to alert them,
	places the target on hold, then proceeds with the transfer
	using a Replaces header field in the Refer-to header. This
	will force the transfee to send an Invite to the target,
	with a replaces header that instructs the target to
	hangup the call between the transferor and the target.
	In this case, the Refer/to: uses the AOR address. (The same
	URI that the transferee used to establish the session with
	the transfer target (To: ). The Require: replaces header should
	be in the INVITE to avoid the wrong UA in a forked SIP proxy
	scenario to answer and have no call to replace with.

	The referred-by header is *NOT* required, but if we get it,
	can be copied into the INVITE to the transfer target to 
	inform the target about the transferor

	"Any REFER request has to be appropriately authenticated.".
	
	We can't destroy dialogs, since we want the call to continue.
