Objective Open H.323 README

Introduction
Objective Open H.323 stack is a simple H.323 implementation in C. This
package contains the core stack code. For complete H.323 stack package with
examples or for more information visit www.obj-sys.com/open
 The ASN.1 messaging code was developed using the Objective Systems ASN1C 
compiler to implement the core H.323 specifications (H.225, H.235, 
and H.245).  Additional code was then developed which makes use of 
the compiler generated code for presenting a comparatively high level 
stack API.

To run the stack test application chansetup
   chansetup - This is a sample program developed for testing multiple calls.
   This program allows stack testing by placing multiple calls. The number of
   calls, duration of each call and interval between successive calls are 
   configurable.  

1. Two instances of this program have to be run. Can be run on same machine or
   different machines.

2. First change to chansetup directory.

        cd tests/chansetup

2. For running listener instance, 

        ./h323peer [--use-ip ip] [--use-port port]

   where local ip address and port can be specified for listening to incoming 
   calls. By default, application determines ip address and uses default H323
   port number 1720.

3. For running calling instance
 
        ./h323peer [--use-ip ip] -n <number of calls> -duration <call duration>
                   -interval <inetrval between successive calls> destination
      
   where all times are in seconds. Interval of 0 means next call will be placed
   after current call finishes. "destination" is the dotted ip address of the
   endpoint running listener instance.

   NOTE: More sample programs are available in the original ooh323c package
   which can be downloaded from www.obj-sys.com/open
