A PBX is only really useful if you can get calls into it.  Of course, you
can use Asterisk with VoIP calls (SIP, H.323, IAX), but you can also talk
to the real PSTN through various cards.

Supported Hardware is divided into two general groups:  Zaptel devices and 
non-zaptel devices.  The Zaptel compatible hardware supports pseudo-TDM 
conferencing and all call features through chan_zap, whereas non-zaptel 
compatible hardware may have different features.
