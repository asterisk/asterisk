/*** DOCUMENTATION
	<function name = "AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT" language="en_US">
		<synopsis>
			DEPRECATED: Used to set whether an audiohook may be inherited to another
			channel. Due to architectural changes in Asterisk 12, audiohook inheritance
			is performed automatically and this function now lacks function.
		</synopsis>
		<description>
			<para>Prior to Asterisk 12, masquerades would occur under all sorts of
			situations which were hard to predict.  In Asterisk 12, masquerades only
			occur as a result of a small set of operations for which inheriting all
			audiohooks from the original channel is now safe.  So in Asterisk 12.5+,
			all audiohooks are inherited without needing other controls expressing
			which audiohooks should be inherited under which conditions.</para>
