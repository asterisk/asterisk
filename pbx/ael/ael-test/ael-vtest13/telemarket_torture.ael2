//
// AN EXERCISE IN BAD DIALPLAN DESIGN
//  (What better testing ground than on telemarketers?)
//


// BAD DESIGN: long, boring introductions followed by long, drawn out menus of choices.
//             if they survive to the last option, how will they remember the choices?
//

// BAD DESIGN: Amateur Recording. Poor voice quality, too quiet.
//              Also, the announcer is definitely not vocally gifted.
//              Also, the long pauses and clicks between the intro
//                    and menu choices might lead some to think that
//                    the announcements are over, and hang up. Too bad!

// WORSE DESIGN: Instead of using the Background application, the Playback
//               application is used. After taking so much time and trouble
//               to record this material, the caller must listen and enjoy
//               every syllable before they can make an option choice. None
//               of that interrupting with a choice. We want them to savour
//               every word!

// GOOD/BAD, ER INSIDIOUS -- DANGLE A CARROT-- GIVE THE LISTENER A GOOD REASON TO
// HANG ON AND VOLUNTARILY LISTEN TO THE TORTURE.
// BUT, DON'T MAKE PROMISES YOU WON'T KEEP!
