; Static extension configuration file, used by
; the pbx_config module. This is where you configure all your 
; inbound and outbound calls in Asterisk. 
; 
; This configuration file is reloaded 
; - With the "extensions reload" command in the CLI
; - With the "reload" command (that reloads everything) in the CLI

;
; The "General" category is for certain variables.  
;

;
; If static is set to no, or omitted, then the pbx_config will rewrite

;
static=yes
;
; if static=yes and writeprotect=no, you can save dialplan by
; CLI command 'save dialplan' too
;
writeprotect=no
;
; If autofallthrough is set, then if an extension runs out of
; things to do, it will terminate the call with BUSY, CONGESTION
; or HANGUP depending on Asterisk's best guess (strongly recommended).
;
; If autofallthrough is not set, then if an extension runs out of 
; things to do, asterisk will wait for a new extension to be dialed 
; (this is the original behavior of Asterisk 1.0 and earlier).
;
autofallthrough=yes
;
; If clearglobalvars is set, global variables will be cleared 
; and reparsed on an extensions reload, or Asterisk reload.
;
; If clearglobalvars is not set, then global variables will persist
; through reloads, and even if deleted from the extensions.conf or
; one if its included files, will remain set to the previous value.
;
clearglobalvars=no
;
; You can include other config files, use the #include command (without the ';')
; Note that this is different from the "include" command that includes contexts within 
; other contexts. The #include command works in all asterisk configuration files.
;#include "filename.conf"

; The "Globals" category contains global variables that can be referenced
; in the dialplan with ${VARIABLE} or ${ENV(VARIABLE)} for Environmental variable
; ${${VARIABLE}} or ${text${VARIABLE}} or any hybrid
;
[globals]
CONSOLE=Console/dsp				; Console interface for demo
;CONSOLE=Zap/1
;CONSOLE=Phone/phone0
IAXINFO=guest					; IAXtel username/password
;IAXINFO=myuser:mypass
TRUNK=Zap/g2					; Trunk interface
;
; Note the 'g2' in the TRUNK variable above. It specifies which group (defined
; in zapata.conf) to dial, i.e. group 2, and how to choose a channel to use in
; the specified group. The four possible options are:
;
; g: select the lowest-numbered non-busy Zap channel (aka. ascending sequential hunt group).
; G: select the highest-numbered non-busy Zap channel (aka. descending sequential hunt group).
; r: use a round-robin search, starting at the next highest channel than last time (aka. ascending rotary hunt group).
; R: use a round-robin search, starting at the next lowest channel than last time (aka. descending rotary hunt group).
;
TRUNKMSD=1					; MSD digits to strip (usually 1 or 0)
;TRUNK=IAX2/user:pass@provider

;
; Any category other than "General" and "Globals" represent 
; extension contexts, which are collections of extensions.  
;
; Extension names may be numbers, letters, or combinations
; thereof. If an extension name is prefixed by a '_'
; character, it is interpreted as a pattern rather than a
; literal.  In patterns, some characters have special meanings:
;
;   X - any digit from 0-9
;   Z - any digit from 1-9
;   N - any digit from 2-9
;   [1235-9] - any digit in the brackets (in this example, 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9)
;   . - wildcard, matches anything remaining (e.g. _9011. matches 
;	anything starting with 9011 excluding 9011 itself)
;   ! - wildcard, causes the matching process to complete as soon as
;       it can unambiguously determine that no other matches are possible
;
; For example the extension _NXXXXXX would match normal 7 digit dialings, 
; while _1NXXNXXXXXX would represent an area code plus phone number
; preceeded by a one.
;
; Each step of an extension is ordered by priority, which must
; always start with 1 to be considered a valid extension.  The priority
; "next" or "n" means the previous priority plus one, regardless of whether
; the previous priority was associated with the current extension or not.
; The priority "same" or "s" means the same as the previously specified
; priority, again regardless of whether the previous entry was for the
; same extension.  Priorities may be immediately followed by a plus sign
; and another integer to add that amount (most useful with 's' or 'n').  
; Priorities may then also have an alias, or label, in 
; parenthesis after their name which can be used in goto situations
;
; Contexts contain several lines, one for each step of each
; extension, which can take one of two forms as listed below,
; with the first form being preferred.  One may include another
; context in the current one as well, optionally with a
; date and time.  Included contexts are included in the order
; they are listed.
