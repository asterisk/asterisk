; This file documents many configuration variables.  Normally unless you

; reason to unrem lines.
;
; remmed-out examples below (those lines that begin with a ';' but no

[trunkgroups]
;
; Trunk groups are used for NFAS or GR-303 connections.
;
; Group: Defines a trunk group.  
;        trunkgroup => <trunkgroup>,<dchannel>[,<backup1>...]
;
;        trunkgroup  is the numerical trunk group to create
;        dchannel    is the zap channel which will have the 
;                    d-channel for the trunk.
;        backup1     is an optional list of backup d-channels.
;
;trunkgroup => 1,24,48
;trunkgroup => 1,24
;
; Spanmap: Associates a span with a trunk group
;        spanmap => <zapspan>,<trunkgroup>[,<logicalspan>]
;
;        zapspan     is the zap span number to associate
;        trunkgroup  is the trunkgroup (specified above) for the mapping
;        logicalspan is the logical span number within the trunk group to use.
;                    if unspecified, no logical span number is used.

; Enable echo cancellation 
; Use either "yes", "no", or a power of two from 32 to 256 if you wish to
; actually set the number of taps of cancellation.
;
; Note that when setting the number of taps, the number 256 does not translate
; to 256 ms of echo cancellation.  echocancel=256 means 256 / 8 = 32 ms.
;
; Note that if any of your Zaptel cards have hardware echo cancellers,
; then this setting only turns them on and off; numeric settings will
; be treated as "yes". There are no special settings required for
; hardware echo cancellers; when present and enabled in their kernel
; modules, they take precedence over the software echo canceller compiled
; into Zaptel automatically.
;
;
echocancel=yes
;
; As of Zaptel 1.4.8, some Zaptel echo cancellers (software and hardware)
; support adjustable parameters; these parameters can be supplied as
; additional options to the 'echocancel' setting. Note that Asterisk
; does not attempt to validate the parameters or their values, so if you
; supply an invalid parameter you will not know the specific reason it
; failed without checking the kernel message log for the error(s)
; put there by Zaptel.
;
;echocancel=128,param1=32,param2=0,param3=14
;
; Generally, it is not necessary (and in fact undesirable) to echo cancel when
; the circuit path is entirely TDM.  You may, however, change this behavior
; by enabling the echo canceller during pure TDM bridging below.
;
echocancelwhenbridged=yes
;
; In some cases, the echo canceller doesn't train quickly enough and there
; is echo at the beginning of the call.  Enabling echo training will cause
; Zaptel to briefly mute the channel, send an impulse, and use the impulse
; response to pre-train the echo canceller so it can start out with a much
; closer idea of the actual echo.  Value may be "yes", "no", or a number of
; milliseconds to delay before training (default = 400)
;
; WARNING:  In some cases this option can make echo worse!  If you are
; trying to debug an echo problem, it is worth checking to see if your echo
; is better with the option set to yes or no.  Use whatever setting gives
; the best results.
;
; Note that these parameters do not apply to hardware echo cancellers.

; If you are having trouble with DTMF detection, you can relax the DTMF

;                increases the volume level on a channel, and a
;                negavive value decreases volume level.
;
;                There are several independent gain settings:
;   rxgain: gain for the rx (receive - into Asterisk) channel. Default: 0.0
;   txgain: gain for the tx (transmit - out of Asterisk Asterisk) channel. 
;           Default: 0.0

;
; If busydetect is enabled, it is also possible to specify how many busy tones

; If busydetect is enabled, it is also possible to specify the cadence of your

; repeats <busycount> times as a busy signal.  If you specify busypattern,

; will further reduce the chance of a false positive.

;busypattern=500,500
;
; NOTE: In make menuselect, you'll find further options to tweak the busy

; is of the form exten@context).  When channels are needed the "idle" calls
; are disconnected (so long as there are at least "minidle" calls still
; running, of course) to make more channels available.  The primary use of
; this is to create a dynamic service, where idle channels are bundled through
; multilink PPP, thus more efficiently utilizing combined voice/data services
; than conventional fixed mappings/muxings.
