; The context to dial the numbers from
number=>01233456,25
; The a follow-me number to call. The format is:
; number=> <number to call[&2nd #[&...]]>[,<timeout value in seconds>[,<order in follow-me>]]
; You can specify as many of these numbers as you like. They will be dialed in the
; order that you specify them in the config file OR as specified with the order field
; on the number prompt. As you can see from the example, forked dialing of multiple
; numbers in the same step is supported with this application if you'd like to dial
; multiple numbers in the same followme step.
;
; The timeout value is the amount of time allowed between the time the dialing step
; starts and the callee answers.  The callee then has until the timeout of the last
; step to make a choice on whether to take the call or not.  That being the case,
; you may want to make the timeout on the last step longer to give enough time to
; make the choice to accept or not.
