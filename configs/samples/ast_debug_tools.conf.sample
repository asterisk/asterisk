# A list of coredumps and/or coredump search patterns.
# Bash extended globs are enabled and any resulting files
# that aren't actually coredumps are silently ignored
# so you can be liberal with the globs.
#
# If your patterns contains spaces be sure to only quote
# the portion of the pattern that DOESN'T contain wildcard
# expressions.  If you quote the whole pattern, it won't
# be expanded and the glob characters will be treated as
# literals.
#
# The exclusion of files ending ".txt" is just for
# demonstration purposes as non-coredumps will be ignored
# anyway.

# Date command for the "running" coredump and tarballs.
# DATEFORMAT will be executed to get the timestamp.
# Don't put quotes around the format string or they'll be
# treated as literal characters.  Also be aware of colons
# in the output as you can't upload files with colons in
