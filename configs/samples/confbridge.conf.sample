; All sounds in the conference are customizable using the bridge profile options below.
; Simply state the option followed by the filename or full path of the filename after

; conference.

;sound_join  ; The sound played to everyone when someone enters the conference.
;sound_leave ; The sound played to everyone when someone leaves the conference.

; --- ConfBridge Menu Options ---
; The ConfBridge application also has the ability to
; apply custom DTMF menus to each channel using the
; application.  Like the User and Bridge profiles
; a menu is passed in to ConfBridge as an argument in
; the dialplan.
;
; Below is a list of menu actions that can be assigned
; to a DTMF sequence.
;
; To have the first DTMF digit in a sequence be the '#' character, you need to
; escape it.  If it is not escaped then normal config file processing will
; think it is a directive like #include.  For example:
; \#1=toggle_mute                      ; Pressing #1 will toggle the mute setting.
;
; A single DTMF sequence can have multiple actions associated with it. This is
; accomplished by stringing the actions together and using a ',' as the delimiter.
; Example:  Both listening and talking volume is reset when '5' is pressed.
; 5=reset_talking_volume, reset_listening_volume
;
; playback(<name of audio file>&<name of audio file>)
                                       ; Playback will play back an audio file to a channel
                                       ; and then immediately return to the conference.
                                       ; This file can not be interupted by DTMF.
                                       ; Mutliple files can be chained together using the
                                       ; '&' character.
; playback_and_continue(<name of playback prompt>&<name of playback prompt>)
                                       ; playback_and_continue will
                                       ; play back a prompt while continuing to
                                       ; collect the dtmf sequence.  This is useful
                                       ; when using a menu prompt that describes all
                                       ; the menu options.  Note however that any DTMF
                                       ; during this action will terminate the prompts
                                       ; playback.  Prompt files can be chained together
                                       ; using the '&' character as a delimiter.
; toggle_mute      ; Toggle turning on and off mute.  Mute will make the user silent
                   ; to everyone else, but the user will still be able to listen in.
; toggle_binaural  ; Toggle on or off binaural audio processing.

; no_op ; This action does nothing (No Operation). Its only real purpose exists for
        ; being able to reserve a sequence in the config as a menu exit sequence.
; decrease_listening_volume ; Decreases the channel's listening volume.
; increase_listening_volume ; Increases the channel's listening volume.
; reset_listening_volume    ; Reset channel's listening volume to default level.

; decrease_talking_volume ; Decreases the channel's talking volume.
; increase_talking_volume ; Icreases the channel's talking volume.
; reset_talking_volume    ; Reset channel's talking volume to default level.
;
; dialplan_exec(context,exten,priority)  ; The dialplan_exec action allows a user
                                         ; to escape from the conference and execute
                                         ; commands in the dialplan.  Once the dialplan
                                         ; exits the user will be put back into the
                                         ; conference.  The possibilities are endless!
; leave_conference ; This action allows a user to exit the conference and continue
                   ; execution in the dialplan.
;
; admin_kick_last  ; This action allows an Admin to kick the last participant from the
                   ; conference. This action will only work for admins which allows
                   ; a single menu to be used for both users and admins.
;
; admin_toggle_conference_lock ; This action allows an Admin to toggle locking and
                               ; unlocking the conference.  Non admins can not use
                               ; this action even if it is in their menu.

; set_as_single_video_src   ; This action allows any user to set themselves as the
                            ; single video source distributed to all participants.
                            ; This will make the video feed stick to them regardless
                            ; of what the video_mode is set to.

; release_as_single_video_src ; This action allows a user to release themselves as
                              ; the video source.  If video_mode is not set to "none"
                              ; this action will result in the conference returning to
                              ; whatever video mode the bridge profile is using.
                              ;
                              ; Note that this action will have no effect if the user
                              ; is not currently the video source.  Also, the user is
                              ; not guaranteed by using this action that they will not
                              ; become the video source again.  The bridge will return
                              ; to whatever operation the video_mode option is set to
                              ; upon release of the video src.

; admin_toggle_mute_participants ; This action allows an administrator to toggle the mute
                                 ; state for all non-admins within a conference.
                                 ; Subsequent non-admins joining a muted conference will
                                 ; start muted.  All admin users are unaffected by this
                                 ; option.  Note that all users, regardless of their admin
                                 ; status, are notified that the conference is muted when
                                 ; the state is toggled.

; participant_count        ; This action plays back the number of participants currently
