; --- ConfBridge Menu Options ---
; The ConfBridge application also has the ability to
; apply custom DTMF menus to each channel using the
; application.  Like the User and Bridge profiles
; a menu is passed in to ConfBridge as an argument in
; the dialplan.
;
; Below is a list of menu actions that can be assigned
; to a DTMF sequence.
;
; To have the first DTMF digit in a sequence be the '#' character, you need to
; escape it.  If it is not escaped then normal config file processing will
; think it is a directive like #include.  For example:
; \#1=toggle_mute                      ; Pressing #1 will toggle the mute setting.
;
; A single DTMF sequence can have multiple actions associated with it. This is
; accomplished by stringing the actions together and using a ',' as the delimiter.
; Example:  Both listening and talking volume is reset when '5' is pressed.
; 5=reset_talking_volume, reset_listening_volume
;
; playback(<name of audio file>&<name of audio file>)
                                       ; Playback will play back an audio file to a channel
                                       ; and then immediately return to the conference.
                                       ; This file can not be interupted by DTMF.
