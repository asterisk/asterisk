; RTP Configuration
;
[general]
;
; RTP start and RTP end configure start and end addresses
;
; Defaults are rtpstart=5000 and rtpend=31000
;
rtpstart=10000
rtpend=20000
;
; Whether to enable or disable UDP checksums on RTP traffic
;
;rtpchecksums=no
;
; The amount of time a DTMF digit with no 'end' marker should be
; allowed to continue (in 'samples', 1/8000 of a second)
;
;dtmftimeout=3000
; rtcpinterval = 5000 	; Milliseconds between rtcp reports
			;(min 500, max 60000, default 5000)
;
; Enable strict RTP protection. This will drop RTP packets that
; do not come from the source of the RTP stream. This option is
; enabled by default.
; strictrtp=yes
;
; Number of packets containing consecutive sequence values needed
; to change the RTP source socket address. This option only comes
; into play while using strictrtp=yes. Consider changing this value
; if rtp packets are dropped from one or both ends after a call is
; connected. This option is set to 4 by default.
; probation=8
;
; Whether to enable or disable ICE support. This option is disabled by default.
; icesupport=true
;
; Hostname or address for the STUN server used when determining the external
; IP address and port an RTP session can be reached at. The port number is
; optional. If omitted the default value of 3478 will be used. This option is
; disabled by default.
;
; e.g. stundaddr=mystun.server.com:3478
;
; stunaddr=
;
; Hostname or address for the TURN server to be used as a relay. The port
; number is optional. If omitted the default value of 3478 will be used.
; This option is disabled by default.
;
; e.g. turnaddr=myturn.server.com:34780
;
; turnaddr=
;
; Username used to authenticate with TURN relay server.
; turnusername=
;
; Password used to authenticate with TURN relay server.
; turnpassword=
;
[ice_host_candidates]
;
; When Asterisk is behind a static NAT and ICE is in use, ICE will expose the
; server's internal IP address as one of the host candidates. Although using
; STUN (see the 'stunaddr' configuration option) will provide a publicly
; accessible IP, the internal IP will still be sent to the remote peer. To
; help hide the topology of your internal network, you can override the host
; candidates that Asterisk will send to the remote peer.
;
; The format for these overrides is:
;
;    interface <local address> => <advertised address>
;
; The following will replace 192.168.1.10 with 1.2.3.4 during ICE
; negoitation:
;
;interface 192.168.1.10 => 1.2.3.4
;
; You can define an override for more than 1 interface if you have a multihomed
; server. Any local interface that is not matched will be passed through
; unaltered. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.
