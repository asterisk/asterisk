[general]
;
; The "general" section contains general parameters relating
; to the operation of the dundi client and server.
;
; The first part should be your complete contact information
; should someone else in your peer group need to contact you.
;
;department=Your Department
;organization=Your Company, Inc.
;locality=Your City
;stateprov=ST
;country=US
;email=your@email.com
;phone=+12565551212
;
;
; Specify bind address. IPv6 addresses are accepted. Default is 0.0.0.0
; You can specify 'bindaddr2' to bind to another address however
; 'bindaddr and 'bindaddr2' need to be different IP protocols.
; Specify port number. Default is 4520.
;
;bindaddr=0.0.0.0
;port=4520
;
; See https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/IP+Quality+of+Service for a description of the tos parameter.
;tos=ef
;
; Our entity identifier.  (It should generally be the MAC address of the
; machine it's running on.  Defaults to the first eth address, but you
; can override it here, as long as you set it to the MAC of *something*
; you own!)  The EID can be overridden by a setting in asterisk.conf
; or by setting this option.
;
;entityid=00:07:E9:3B:76:60
;
; Peers shall cache our query responses for the specified time
; in seconds. Default is 3600.
;
;cachetime=3600
;
; This defines the max depth (hops) in which to search the DUNDi system.
; Note that the maximum time that we will wait for a response is
; (2000 + 200 * ttl) ms.
;
ttl=32
;
; If we don't get ACK to our DPDISCOVER within 2000ms and autokill is set
; to yes then we cancel the whole thing (that's enough time for one
; retransmission only).  This is used to keep things from stalling for a long
; time for a host that is not available, but would be ill advised for bad
; connections.  In addition to 'yes' or 'no' you can also specify a number
; of milliseconds.  See 'qualify' for individual peers to turn on for just
; a specific peer.
;
autokill=yes
;
; pbx_dundi creates a rotating key called "secret", under the family
; 'secretpath'.  The default family is dundi (resulting in
; the key being held at dundi/secret).
;
;secretpath=dundi
;
; The 'storehistory' option (also changeable at runtime with
; 'dundi store history on' and 'dundi store history off') will
; cause the DUNDi engine to keep track of the last several
; queries and the amount of time each query took to execute
; for the purpose of tracking slow nodes.  This option is
; off by default due to performance impacts.
;
;storehistory=yes

[mappings]
;
; The "mappings" section maps DUNDi contexts
; to contexts on the local asterisk system.  Remember
; that numbers that are made available under the e164
; DUNDi context are regulated by the DUNDi General Peering
; Agreement (GPA) if you are a member of the DUNDi E.164
; Peering System.
;
; dundi_context => [local_context,weight,tech,dest{,options}]
;
; 'dundi_context' is the name of the context being requested
; within the DUNDi request
;
; 'local_context' is the name of the context on the local system
; in which numbers can be looked up for which responses shall be given.
;
; 'weight' is the weight to use for the responses provided from this
; mapping.  The number must be >= 0 and < 60000.  Since it is totally
; valid to receive multiple responses to a query, responses received
; with a lower weight are tried first.  Note that the weight has a
; special meaning in the e164 context - see the GPA for more details.
;
; 'tech' is the technology to use (IAX2, SIP, H323)
;
; 'dest' is the Dial application's channel technology resource destination
; to supply for reaching that number.  The following variables can be used
; in the destination string and will be automatically substituted:
; ${NUMBER}: The number being requested
; ${IPADDR}: The IP address to connect to
; ${SECRET}: The current IAX2 rotating secret key to be used
;
; Further options may include:
;
; nounsolicited:  No unsolicited calls of any type permitted via this
;                 route
; nocomunsolicit: No commercial unsolicited calls permitted via
;                 this route
; residential:    This number is known to be a residence
; commercial:     This number is known to be a business
; mobile:         This number is known to be a mobile phone
; nocomunsolicit: No commercial unsolicited calls permitted via
;                 this route
; nopartial:      Do not search for partial matches
;
; There *must* exist an entry in mappings for DUNDi to respond
; to any request, although it may be empty.
;
;empty_context =>
;
;e164 => dundi-e164-canonical,0,IAX2,dundi:${SECRET}@${IPADDR}/${NUMBER},nounsolicited,nocomunsolicit,nopartial
;e164 => dundi-e164-customers,100,IAX2,dundi:${SECRET}@${IPADDR}/${NUMBER},nounsolicited,nocomunsolicit,nopartial

;
;digexten => default,0,IAX2,guest@lappy/${NUMBER}

;
; Weights for mappings can be set a few different ways:
;
; 1) It can be set as a static number.
;testmap1 => context1,222,IAX2,guest@peer1/${NUMBER}
;
; 2) It can be an Asterisk global variable.
;testmap2 => context2,${DUNDITESTVAR},IAX2,guest@peer2${NUMBER}
;
; 3) It can be retrieved using a dialplan function.  This can be extremely
;    useful if you want to let an external script decide what the weight
;    in a response should be.
;testmap3 => context3,${SHELL(echo 123)},IAX2,guest@peer3/${NUMBER}
;
; The built in variables ${SECRET}, ${IPADDR} and ${NUMBER} can also be
; passed to the weight. For example, you could pass the ${NUMBER} value
; to your SHELL() script and use that to dynamically return a weight.
;
; Note when using a global variable or dialplan function to set the
; weight for a mapping that response caching should be disabled if you
; plan for these values to change frequently at all.  If the results are
; cached then any change in value will not take effect until the cache
; has expired.
;

;
; The remaining sections represent the peers that we fundamentally trust.
; The section name specifies the peer's entityid.  You can specify which
; DUNDi contexts with which you want the trust to be established.
;
; inkey - What key they will be authenticating to us with
;
; outkey - What key we use to authenticate to them
;
; host - What their host is (DNS name, IP address, or dynamic)
;
; port - The port where their host is listening (default: 4520)
;
; ustothem - Explicitly specify the entityid we use with this peer.
;
; order - What search order to use.  May be 'primary', 'secondary',
;         'tertiary' or 'quartiary'.  In large systems, it is beneficial
;         to only query one up-stream host in order to maximize caching
;         value.  Adding one with primary and one with secondary gives you
;         redundancy without sacrificing performance.
;
; include - Includes this peer when searching a particular context
;           for lookup (set "all" to perform all lookups with that
;           host.  This is also the context in which peers are permitted
;           to precache.
;
; noinclude - Excludes this peer when searching a particular context
;             for lookup (set "all" to perform no lookups with that
;             host.
;
; permit - Permits this peer to search a given DUNDi context on
;          the local system.  Set "all" to permit this host to
;          lookup all contexts.  This is also a context for which
;          we will create/forward PRECACHE commands.
;
; deny -   Denies this peer to search a given DUNDi context on
;          the local system.  Set "all" to deny this host to
;          lookup all contexts.
;
; model - inbound, outbound, or symmetric for whether we receive
;         requests only, transmit requests only, or do both.
;
; precache - Utilize/Permit precaching with this peer (to pre
;            cache means to provide an answer when no request
;            was made and is used so that machines with few
;            routes can push those routes up to a higher level).
;            outgoing means we send precache routes to this peer,
;            incoming means we permit this peer to send us
;            precache routes.  symmetric means we do both.
;
; Note: You cannot mix symmetric/outbound model with symmetric/inbound
; precache, nor can you mix symmetric/inbound model with symmetric/outbound
; precache.
;
; qualify - Enable qualifying the peer to determine reachable status.
;           Set to yes, no, or number of milliseconds for qualifying
;           the peer's reachable status.
;
; register - Enable registering with the peer.  This presupposes that the
;            peer's host option for us is dynamic.  (yes/no value)
;
; The '*' peer is special and matches an unspecified entity
;
