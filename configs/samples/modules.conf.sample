; Any modules that need to be loaded before the Asterisk core has been
; initialized (just after the logger initialization) can be loaded
; using 'preload'.  'preload' forces a module and the modules it
; is known to depend upon to be loaded earlier than they normally get
; loaded.
;
; NOTE: There is no good reason left to use 'preload' anymore.  It was
; historically required to preload realtime driver modules so you could
; map Asterisk core configuration files to Realtime storage.
; This is no longer needed.
