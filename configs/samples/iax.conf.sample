; General settings, like port number to bind to, and an option address (the
; default is to bind to all local addresses).

[general]

; Listener Addresses
;
; Use the 'bindaddr' and 'bindport' options to specify on which address and port
; the IAX2 channel driver will listen for incoming requests.

; Jitter Buffer
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;
; You can adjust several parameters relating to the jitter buffer.  The jitter
; buffer's function is to compensate for varying network delay.
;
; All of the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.  The jitter buffer
; works for INCOMING audio only - the outbound audio will be dejittered by the
; jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; jitterbuffer=yes|no: global default as to whether you want
; the jitter buffer at all.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
;
; jittertargetextra: number of milliseconds by which the new jitter buffer
; will pad its size. the default is 40, so without modification, the new
; jitter buffer will set its size to the jitter value plus 40 milliseconds.
; increasing this value may help if your network normally has low jitter,
; but occasionally has spikes.

; IAX2 Encryption
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;
; Enable IAX2 encryption.  The default is no.
;
;encryption=yes
;

;
; Force encryption insures no connection is established unless both sides
; support encryption.  By turning this option on, encryption is automatically
; turned on as well.  The default is no.
;
;forceencryption=yes
;

; This option defines the maximum payload in bytes an IAX2 trunk can support at
; a given time.  The best way to explain this is to provide an example.  If the
; maximum number of calls to be supported is 800, and each call transmits 20ms
; frames of audio using ulaw:
;
;     (8000hz / 1000ms) * 20ms * 1 byte per sample = 160 bytes per frame
;
; The maximum load in bytes is:
;
;     (160 bytes per frame) * (800 calls) = 128000 bytes
;
; Once this limit is reached, calls may be dropped or begin to lose audio.
; Depending on the codec in use and number of channels to be supported this value
; may need to be raised, but in most cases the default value is large enough.
;
; trunkmaxsize = 128000 ; defaults to 128000 bytes, which supports up to 800
                        ; calls of ulaw at 20ms a frame.

; With a large amount of traffic on IAX2 trunks, there is a risk of bad voice
; quality when allowing the Linux system to handle fragmentation of UDP packets.
; Depending on the size of each payload, allowing the OS to handle fragmentation
; may not be very efficient. This setting sets the maximum transmission unit for
; IAX2 UDP trunking. The default is 1240 bytes which means if a trunk's payload
; is over 1240 bytes for every 20ms it will be broken into multiple 1240 byte
; messages.  Zero disables this functionality and let's the OS handle
; fragmentation.
;
; trunkmtu = 1240    ; trunk data will be sent in 1240 byte messages.

; trunkfreq sets how frequently trunk messages are sent in milliseconds. This
; value is 20ms by default, which means the trunk will send all the data queued
; to it in the past 20ms.  By increasing the time between sending trunk messages,
; the trunk's payload size will increase as well.  Note, depending on the size
; set by trunkmtu, messages may be sent more often than specified.  For example
; if a trunk's message size grows to the trunkmtu size before 20ms is reached
; that message will be sent immediately.  Acceptable values are between 10ms and
; 1000ms.
;
; trunkfreq=20    ; How frequently to send trunk msgs (in ms). This is 20ms by
                  ; default.

; Should we send timestamps for the individual sub-frames within trunk frames?
; There is a small bandwidth use for these (less than 1kbps/call), but they
; ensure that frame timestamps get sent end-to-end properly.  If both ends of
; all your trunks go directly to TDM, _and_ your trunkfreq equals the frame
; length for your codecs, you can probably suppress these.  The receiver must
; also support this feature, although they do not also need to have it enabled.

; Through the use of the res_stun_monitor module, Asterisk has the ability to detect when the
; perceived external network address has changed.  When the stun_monitor is installed and
; configured, chan_iax will renew all outbound registrations when the monitor detects any sort
; of network change has occurred. By default this option is enabled, but only takes effect once

; The following two options are used to disable call token validation for the
; purposes of interoperability with IAX2 endpoints that do not yet support it.
;
; Call token validation can be set as optional for a single IP address or IP

; only a global option.
;
;calltokenoptional=209.16.236.73/255.255.255.0
;
; By setting 'requirecalltoken=no', call token validation becomes optional for
; that peer/user.  By setting 'requirecalltoken=auto', call token validation
; is optional until a call token supporting peer registers successfully using
; call token validation.  This is used as an indication that from now on, we
; can require it from this peer.  So, requirecalltoken is internally set to yes.
; requirecalltoken may only be used in peer/user/friend definitions,
; not in the global scope.
; By default, 'requirecalltoken=yes'.
;
;requirecalltoken=no
;

;
; These options are used to limit the amount of call numbers allocated to a
; single IP address.  Before changing any of these values, it is highly encouraged
; to read the user guide associated with these options first.  In most cases, the
; default values for these options are sufficient.
;
; The 'maxcallnumbers' option limits the amount of call numbers allowed for each
; individual remote IP address.  Once an IP address reaches it's call number
; limit, no more new connections are allowed until the previous ones close.  This
; option can be used in a peer definition as well, but only takes effect for
; the IP of a dynamic peer after it completes registration.
;
;maxcallnumbers=512
;
; The 'maxcallnumbers_nonvalidated' is used to set the combined number of call
; numbers that can be allocated for connections where call token  validation
; has been disabled.  Unlike the 'maxcallnumbers' option, this limit is not
; separate for each individual IP address.  Any connection resulting in a
; non-call token validated call number being allocated contributes to this
; limit.  For use cases, see the call token user guide.  This option's
; default value of 8192 should be sufficient in most cases.
;
;maxcallnumbers_nonvalidated=1024
;
; The [callnumberlimits] section allows custom call number limits to be set
; for specific IP addresses and IP address ranges.  These limits take precedence
; over the global 'maxcallnumbers' option, but may still be overridden by a
; peer defined 'maxcallnumbers' entry.  Note that these limits take effect
; for every individual address within the range, not the range as a whole.

; to the other side.  Public keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.pub
; while private keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.key.  Private

                            ; encryption.  This option will disable the
                            ; IAX_COMMAND_RTENC message.  The default is 'on.'

; Peers can remotely register as well, so that they can be mobile.  Default
; IPs can also optionally be given but are not required.  Caller*ID can be
; suggested to the other side as well if it is for example a phone instead of
; another PBX.
;connectedline=yes ; Set if connected line and redirecting information updates
;                  ; are passed between Asterisk servers for this peer.
;                  ; yes - Sending and receiving updates are enabled.
;                  ; send - Only send updates.
;                  ; receive - Only process received updates.
;                  ; no - Sending and receiving updates are disabled.
;                  ; Default is "no".
;                  ;
;                  ; Note: Because of an incompatibility between Asterisk v1.4
;                  ; and Asterisk v1.8 or later, this option must be set
;                  ; to "no" toward the Asterisk v1.4 peer.  A symptom of the
;                  ; incompatibility is the call gets disconnected unexpectedly.
