;mindtmfduration = 80		; Set minimum DTMF duration in ms (default 80 ms)

;transmit_silence = yes		; Transmit silence while a channel is in a
				; waiting state, a recording only state, or

				; silence internally is generated in raw signed

				; channel before it can be sent to the device.
				; It is for this reason that this is optional,

				; Default no
;entityid=00:11:22:33:44:55	; Entity ID.
				; This is in the form of a MAC address.
				; It should be universally unique.
				; It must be unique between servers communicating

;rtp_pt_dynamic = 96		; Normally the Dynamic RTP Payload Type numbers

				; RTP mapping available", extend the dynamic
				; range by going for 35 (or 0) instead of 96.
				; This allows 29 (or 64) more formats. 96 is the

				; rejected by a remote implementation; although
				; no such broken implementation is known, yet.
