; Static configuration files:
;
; file.conf => driver,database[,table[,priority]]
;
; maps a particular configuration file to the given
; database driver, database and table (or uses the
; name of the file as the table if not specified)
;
; Uncomment to load queues.conf via the odbc engine.
;
;queues.conf => odbc,asterisk,ast_config
;extensions.conf => sqlite,asterisk,ast_config
;
; The following files CANNOT be loaded from Realtime storage:
;	asterisk.conf
;	extconfig.conf (this file)
;	logger.conf
;
; Additionally, the following files cannot be loaded from
; Realtime storage unless the storage driver is loaded
; early using 'preload' statements in modules.conf:
;	manager.conf
;	cdr.conf
;	rtp.conf
;
; Named ACLs specified in realtime also can not be used
; from manager.conf unless the storage driver is preloaded.
; Attempting to use a realtime stored named ACL before the
; driver is loaded will result in an invalid ACL which
; rejects all addresses.
;
; Realtime configuration engine
;
; maps a particular family of realtime
; configuration to a given database driver,
; database and table (or uses the name of
; the family if the table is not specified
;
;example => odbc,asterisk,alttable,1
;example => mysql,asterisk,alttable,2
;example2 => ldap,"dc=oxymium,dc=net",example2
;
; Additionally, priorities are now supported for use as failover methods
; for retrieving realtime data.  If one connection fails to retrieve any
; information, the next sequential priority will be tried next.  This
; especially works well with ODBC connections, since res_odbc now caches
; when connection failures occur and prevents immediately retrying those
; connections until after a specified timeout.  Note:  priorities must
; start at 1 and be sequential (i.e. if you have only priorities 1, 2,
; and 4, then 4 will be ignored, because there is no 3).
;
;
; Possible driver backends:
;
; "odbc" is shown in the examples below, but is not the only valid realtime
; engine.  Here are several of the possible options:
;    odbc ... res_config_odbc
;    sqlite3 ... res_config_sqlite3
;    pgsql ... res_config_pgsql
;    curl ... res_config_curl
;    ldap ... res_config_ldap
;    mysql ... res_config_mysql (available via add-ons in menuselect)
;
; Note: The res_config_pgsql backend configures the database used in their
; respective configuration files and ignore the database name configured in
; this file.

;
; While most dynamic realtime engines are automatically used when defined in
; this file, 'extensions', distinctively, is not.  To activate dynamic realtime
; extensions, you must turn them on in each respective context within
; extensions.conf with a switch statement.  The syntax is:
;      switch => Realtime/[[db_context@]tablename]/<opts>
; The only option available currently is the 'p' option, which disallows
; extension pattern queries to the database.  If you have no patterns defined
; in a particular context, this will save quite a bit of CPU time.  However,
; note that using dynamic realtime extensions is not recommended anymore as a
; best practice; instead, you should consider writing a static dialplan with
; proper data abstraction via a tool like func_odbc.
