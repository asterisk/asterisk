The included Asterisk configuration files are intended to be an example
implementation for a fictitious company, Super Awesome Company.

It can serve as a handy reference for understanding a simple Asterisk
configuration in an approximate real-world environment.

If you intend to use this configuration as a template for your own, then
you will need to change many values in the various configuration files to
match your own devices, network, SIP ITSP accounts and more.

For further documentation on this configuration see the Asterisk documentation:
https://docs.asterisk.org/Deployment/Reference-Use-Cases-for-Asterisk/.

Please report bugs or errors in configuration on the Asterisk issue tracker:
https://docs.asterisk.org/Asterisk-Community/Asterisk-Issue-Guidelines/
