; Sample Call Features (parking, transfer, etc) configuration
;

[general]

; OPTIONS THAT CAN ONLY BE SET IN THE GENERAL CONTEXT

;featuredigittimeout = 1000     ; Max time (ms) between digits for
                                ; feature activation  (default is 1000 ms)

; Pickup Options
;
;pickupexten = *8               ; Configure the pickup extension. (default is *8)
;pickupsound = beep             ; to indicate a successful pickup (default: no sound)
;pickupfailsound = beeperr      ; to indicate that the pickup failed (default: no sound)

; Transfer Options
;
;transferdigittimeout => 3      ; Number of seconds to wait between digits when transferring a call
                                ; (default is 3 seconds)
;xfersound = beep               ; to indicate an attended transfer is complete
;xferfailsound = beeperr        ; to indicate a failed transfer
;atxfernoanswertimeout = 15     ; Timeout for answer on attended transfer default is 15 seconds.
;atxferloopdelay = 10           ; Number of seconds to sleep between retries (if atxferdropcall = no)
;atxfercallbackretries = 2      ; Number of times to attempt to send the call back to the transferer.
                                ; By default, this is 2.
;atxferdropcall = no            ; If someone does an attended transfer, then hangs up before the transferred
                                ; caller is connected, then by default, the system will try to call back the
                                ; person that did the transfer.  If this is set to "yes", the callback will
                                ; not be attempted and the transfer will just fail.
                                ; For atxferdropcall=no to work properly, you also need to
                                ; define ATXFER_NULL_TECH in main/features.c.  The reason the
                                ; code is not enabled by default is spelled out in the comment
                                ; block near the top of main/features.c describing ATXFER_NULL_TECH.

; Parking Options
;
; These options apply to all parking lots, including the default lot defined in
; the general context.
;
;courtesytone = beep            ; Sound file to play to when someone picks up a parked call
                                ; and also when the Touch Monitor is activated/deactivated.
                                ; Default is no tone.
;parkedplay = caller            ; Who to play courtesytone to when picking up a parked call.
                                ; One of: parked, caller, both  (default is caller)
;parkeddynamic = yes            ; Enables dynamically created parkinglots. (default is no)
;adsipark = yes                 ; if you want ADSI parking announcements


; OPTIONS THAT CAN BE SET PER PARKING LOT
;
; If these options are set in the general context, they will *only* apply to the default
; parking lot. If set in any other lot, they will *only* apply to that lot.

parkext => 700                  ; What extension to dial to park. This option can take any alphanumeric string.
                                ; (default is 700 for all lots)
;parkext_exclusive=yes          ; Specify that the parkext created for this parking lot
                                ; will only access this parking lot. (default is no for all lots)
parkpos => 701-750              ; What extensions to park calls on.
                                ; (default is 701-750 for the default lot and blank for custom lots)
                                ; These need to be numeric, as Asterisk starts from the start position
                                ; and increments with one for the next parked call. Hence, leading zeros
                                ; and non-numerical characters will be ignored.
context => parkedcalls          ; Which context parked calls are in (default is parkedcalls for the default lot and blank for custom lots)
;parkinghints = no              ; Add hints priorities automatically for parking slots (default is no for all lots).
;parkingtime => 45              ; Number of seconds a call can be parked before returning.
                                ; (default is 45 for all lots)
;parkedcalltransfers = caller   ; Enables or disables DTMF based transfers when picking up a parked call.
                                ; one of: callee, caller, both, no (default is no for all lots)
;parkedcallreparking = caller   ; Enables or disables DTMF based parking when picking up a parked call.
                                ; one of: callee, caller, both, no (default is no for all lots)
;parkedcallhangup = caller      ; Enables or disables DTMF based hangups when picking up a parked call.
                                ; one of: callee, caller, both, no (default is no for all lots)
;parkedcallrecording = caller   ; Enables or disables DTMF based one-touch recording when picking up a parked call.
                                ; one of: callee, caller, both, no (default is no for all lots)
;findslot => next               ; Continue to the 'next' free parking space.
                                ; (Default is 'first' for all lots)
;parkedmusicclass=default       ; This is the MOH class to use for the parked channel
                                ; as long as the class is not set on the channel directly
                                ; using Set(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the dialplan.
                                ; (Default is 'default' for the default parking lot. Non-default parkinglots
                                ; don't specify a class so the class is picked by the channel put on hold
                                ; which has the 'default' class by default.)
;comebacktoorigin = yes         ; Setting this option configures the behavior of call parking when the
                                ; parked call times out (See the parkingtime option).  The default value is 'yes'.
                                ;
                                ; 'yes' - When the parked call times out, attempt to send the call back to the peer
                                ;         that parked this call. This is done by saving off the name of the channel
                                ;         that parked the call. The call will return to the context 'park-dial' and
                                ;         an extension created based on the name of the channel that originally parked
                                ;         the call.  This extension will be created automatically to do a Dial() to the
                                ;         device that originally parked the call for comebacktodialtime seconds. If the
                                ;         call is not answered, the call will proceed to 'park-dial,t,1'.
                                ;
                                ; 'no'  - This option is useful for performing custom dialplan functionality prior to
                                ;         sending the call back to the extension that initially parked the call, or to
                                ;         an entirely different destination.
                                ;
                                ;         When the parked call times out, send it back to the dialplan.  The location
                                ;         will be defined by the comebackcontext option. The extension will be built from
                                ;         the saved channel name that parked the call. For example, if a SIP peer named
                                ;         '0004F2040001' parked this call, the extension will be 'SIP_0004F2040001'.
                                ;         (Note that an underscore is used here because the '/' character has a special
                                ;         meaning in extension names for CallerID matching.)  If this extension does not
                                ;         exist, the call will be sent to the 's' extension, instead.  Finally, if the 's'
                                ;         extension of 'parkedcallstimeout' does not exist, the call will fall back to the
                                ;         's' extension of the 'default' context.
                                ;
                                ;         Additionally, in this example an extension of 'SIP_0004F2040001' will be
                                ;         created in the 'park-dial' context.  This extension will be set up to do a
                                ;         Dial() to 'SIP/0004F2040001'.
                                ;
                                ;         During the timeout procedure, the following variables are set
                                ;         PARKINGSLOT - extension that the call was parked in prior to timing out
                                ;         PARKEDLOT - name of the lot that the call was parked in prior to timing out
                                ;         PARKER - name of the device that parked the call

;comebackdialtime = 30          ; When a parked call times out, this is the number of seconds to dial the device that
                                ; originally parked the call.  It is also available as a channel variable COMEBACKDIALTIME
                                ; after a parked call has timed out.
                                ; The default value is 30 seconds.
;comebackcontext = parkedcallstimeout
                                ; The context a timed out call will return to if comebcktoorigin=no.
                                ; The default value is 'parkedcallstimeout'.


; EXAMPLE NON-DEFAULT PARKING LOT DEFINITION
;
; You can set parkinglot with the CHANNEL dialplan function
; or by setting 'parkinglot' directly in the channel configuration file.
;
; (Note: Leading '0's and any non-numerical characters on parkpos extensions
;  will be ignored.  Parkext on the other hand can be any string.)
;
;[parkinglot_edvina]
;context => edvinapark
;parkext => 799
;parkpos => 800-850
;findslot => next
;comebacktoorigin = no
;comebackdialtime = 90
;comebackcontext = edvinapark-timeout ; Make sure you create the context!
;parkedmusicclass = edvina

; EXAMPLE DTMF FEATURE MAP
;
; Note that the DTMF features listed below only work when two channels have answered and are bridged together.
; They can not be used while the remote party is ringing or in progress. If you require this feature you can use
; chan_local in combination with Answer to accomplish it.

[featuremap]
;blindxfer => #1                ; Blind transfer  (default is #) -- Make sure to set the T and/or t option in the Dial() or Queue() app call!
;disconnect => *0               ; Disconnect  (default is *) -- Make sure to set the H and/or h option in the Dial() or Queue() app call!
                                ; Note that Agents via chan_agent use * to disconnect a call by default. If you are wanting to use * 
                                ; to abort a transfer you will either need to change the disconnect code here or set endcall to no in agents.conf 
;automon => *1                  ; One Touch Record a.k.a. Touch Monitor -- Make sure to set the W and/or w option in the Dial() or Queue() app call!
;atxfer => *2                   ; Attended transfer  -- Make sure to set the T and/or t option in the Dial() or Queue()  app call!
;parkcall => #72                ; Park call (one step parking)  -- Make sure to set the K and/or k option in the Dial() app call!
;automixmon => *3               ; One Touch Record a.k.a. Touch MixMonitor -- Make sure to set the X and/or x option in the Dial() or Queue() app call!

; EXAMPLE DYNAMIC FEATURES APPLICATION MAP
;

[applicationmap]
; Note that the DYNAMIC_FEATURES channel variable must be set to use the features
; defined here.  The value of DYNAMIC_FEATURES should be the names of the features
; to allow the channel to use separated by '#'.  For example:
;
;    Set(__DYNAMIC_FEATURES=myfeature1#myfeature2#myfeature3)
;
; (Note: The two leading underscores allow these feature settings to be set on
;  on the outbound channels, as well.  Otherwise, only the original channel
;  will have access to these features.)
;
; The syntax for declaring a dynamic feature is any of the following:
;
;<FeatureName> => <DTMF_sequence>,<ActivateOn>[/<ActivatedBy>],<Application>[,<AppArguments>[,MOH_Class]]
;<FeatureName> => <DTMF_sequence>,<ActivateOn>[/<ActivatedBy>],<Application>[,"<AppArguments>"[,MOH_Class]]
;<FeatureName> => <DTMF_sequence>,<ActivateOn>[/<ActivatedBy>],<Application>([<AppArguments>])[,MOH_Class]

;
;  FeatureName   -> This is the name of the feature used when setting the
;                   DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable to enable usage of this feature.
;  DTMF_sequence -> This is the key sequence used to activate this feature.
;  ActivateOn    -> This is the channel of the call that the application will be executed
;                   on. Valid values are "self" and "peer". "self" means run the
;                   application on the same channel that activated the feature. "peer"
;                   means run the application on the opposite channel from the one that
;                   has activated the feature.
;  ActivatedBy   -> This is which channel is allowed to activate this feature. Valid
;                   values are "caller", "callee", and "both". "both" is the default.
;                   The "caller" is the channel that executed the Dial application, while
;                   the "callee" is the channel called by the Dial application.
;  Application   -> This is the application to execute.
;  AppArguments  -> These are the arguments to be passed into the application.  If you need
;                   commas in your arguments, you should use either the second or third
;                   syntax, above.
;  MOH_Class     -> This is the music on hold class to play while the idle
;                   channel waits for the feature to complete. If left blank,
;                   no music will be played.
;

;
; IMPORTANT NOTE: The applicationmap is not intended to be used for all Asterisk
;   applications. When applications are used in extensions.conf, they are executed
;   by the PBX core. In this case, these applications are executed outside of the
;   PBX core, so it does *not* make sense to use any application which has any
;   concept of dialplan flow. Examples of this would be things like Macro, Goto,
;   Background, WaitExten, and many more.
;
; Enabling these features means that the PBX needs to stay in the media flow and
; media will not be re-directed if DTMF is sent in the media stream.
;
; Example Usage:
;
;testfeature => #9,peer,Playback,tt-monkeys  ;Allow both the caller and callee to play
;                                            ;tt-monkeys to the opposite channel
;
; Set arbitrary channel variables, based upon CALLERID number (Note that the application
; argument contains commas)
;retrieveinfo => #8,peer,Set(ARRAY(CDR(mark),CDR(name))=${ODBC_FOO(${CALLERID(num)})})
;
;pauseMonitor   => #1,self/callee,Pausemonitor     ;Allow the callee to pause monitoring
;                                                  ;on their channel
;unpauseMonitor => #3,self/callee,UnPauseMonitor   ;Allow the callee to unpause monitoring
;                                                  ;on their channel

; Dynamic Feature Groups:
;   Dynamic feature groups are groupings of features defined in [applicationmap]
;   that can have their own custom key mappings.  To give a channel access to a dynamic
;   feature group, add the group name to the value of the DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable.
;
; example:
; [myGroupName]         ; defines the group named myGroupName
; testfeature => #9     ; associates testfeature with the group and the keycode '#9'.
; pauseMonitor =>       ; associates pauseMonitor with the group and uses the keycode specified
;                       ; in the [applicationmap].
