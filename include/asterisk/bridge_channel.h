 *
 * An API that act on a channel in a bridge. Note that while the
 * \ref ast_bridge_channel is owned by a channel, it should only be used
 * by members of the bridging system. The only places where this API should
 * be used is:
 *  \arg \ref AstBridging API itself
 *  \arg Bridge mixing technologies
 *  \arg Bridge sub-classes
 *
 * In general, anywhere else it is unsafe to use this API. Care should be
 * taken when using this API to ensure that the locking order remains
 * correct. The locking order must be:
 *  \arg The \ref \c ast_bridge
 *  \arg The \ref \c ast_bridge_channel
 *  \arg The \ref \c ast_channel
