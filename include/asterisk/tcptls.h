 * \brief Generic support for tcp/tls servers in Asterisk.
 * \note In order to have TLS/SSL support, we need the openssl libraries.
 * Still we can decide whether or not to use them by commenting
 * in or out the DO_SSL macro.
 *
 * TLS/SSL support is basically implemented by reading from a config file
 * (currently manager.conf, http.conf and sip.conf) the names of the certificate
 * files and cipher to use, and then run ssl_setup() to create an appropriate 
 * data structure named ssl_ctx.
 *
 * If we support multiple domains, presumably we need to read multiple
 * certificates.
 *
 * When we are requested to open a TLS socket, we run make_file_from_fd()
 * on the socket, to do the necessary setup. At the moment the context's name
 * is hardwired in the function, but we can certainly make it into an extra
 * parameter to the function.
 *
 * We declare most of ssl support variables unconditionally,
 * because their number is small and this simplifies the code.
 *
 * \note The ssl-support variables (ssl_ctx, do_ssl, certfile, cipher)
 * and their setup should be moved to a more central place, e.g. asterisk.conf
 * and the source files that processes it. Similarly, ssl_setup() should
 * be run earlier in the startup process so modules have it available.
 * 
 * \ref AstTlsOverview
 *
 * \todo For SIP, the SubjectAltNames should be checked on verification
 *       of the certificate. (Check RFC 5922)

/*! \page AstTlsOverview TLS Implementation Overview
 *
 * The following code implements a generic mechanism for starting
 * services on a TCP or TLS socket.
 * The service is configured in the struct session_args, and
 * then started by calling server_start(desc) on the descriptor.
 * server_start() first verifies if an instance of the service is active,
 * and in case shuts it down. Then, if the service must be started, creates
 * a socket and a thread in charge of doing the accept().
 *
 * The body of the thread is desc->accept_fn(desc), which the user can define
 * freely. We supply a sample implementation, server_root(), structured as an
 * infinite loop. At the beginning of each iteration it runs periodic_fn()
 * if defined (e.g. to perform some cleanup etc.) then issues a poll()
 * or equivalent with a timeout of 'poll_timeout' milliseconds, and if the
 * following accept() is successful it creates a thread in charge of
 * running the session, whose body is desc->worker_fn(). The argument of
 * worker_fn() is a struct ast_tcptls_session_instance, which contains the address
 * of the other party, a pointer to desc, the file descriptors (fd) on which
 * we can do a select/poll (but NOT I/O), and a FILE *on which we can do I/O.
 * We have both because we want to support plain and SSL sockets, and
 * going through a FILE * lets us provide the encryption/decryption
 * on the stream without using an auxiliary thread.
