 * \brief Endpoint abstractions.
 *
 * \author David M. Lee, II <dlee@digium.com>
 * \since 12
 *
 * An endpoint is an external device/system that may offer/accept channels
 * to/from Asterisk. While this is a very useful concept for end users, it is
 * surprisingly \a not a core concept within Asterisk itself.
 *
 * This file defines \ref ast_endpoint as a seperate object, which channel
 * drivers may use to expose their concept of an endpoint. As the channel driver
 * creates channels, it can use ast_endpoint_add_channel() to associate channels
 * to the endpoint. This updates the endpoint appropriately, and forwards all of
 * the channel's events to the endpoint's topic.
 *
 * In order to avoid excessive locking on the endpoint object itself, the
 * mutable state is not accessible via getters. Instead, you can create a
 * snapshot using ast_endpoint_snapshot_create() to get a consistent snapshot of
 * the internal state.
