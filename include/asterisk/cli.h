/*! \page CLI_command_API CLI command API

   CLI commands are described by a struct ast_cli_entry that contains
   all the components for their implementation.

   In the "old-style" format, the record must contain:
   - a NULL-terminated array of words constituting the command, e.g.
	{ "set", "debug", "on", NULL },
   - a summary string (short) and a usage string (longer);
   - a handler which implements the command itself, invoked with
     a file descriptor and argc/argv as typed by the user
   - a 'generator' function which, given a partial string, can
     generate legal completions for it.
   An example is

	int old_setdebug(int fd, int argc, char *argv[]);
	char *dbg_complete(const char *line, const char *word, int pos, int n);

	{ { "set", "debug", "on", NULL }, do_setdebug, "Enable debugging",
	set_debug_usage, dbg_complete },

   In the "new-style" format, all the above functionalities are implemented
   by a single function, and the arguments tell which output is required.
   The prototype is the following:

	char *new_setdebug(const struct ast_cli_entry *e, int cmd, struct ast_cli_args *a);

	...
	// this is how we create the entry to register 
	AST_CLI_DEFINE(new_setdebug, "short description")
	...

   To help the transition, we make the pointer to the struct ast_cli_entry
   available to old-style handlers via argv[-1].

   An example of new-style handler is the following

\code
static char *test_new_cli(struct ast_cli_entry *e, int cmd, struct ast_cli_args *a)
{
	static const char * const choices[] = { "one", "two", "three", NULL };

        switch (cmd) {
        case CLI_INIT:
		e->command = "do this well";
                e->usage =
			"Usage: do this well <arg>\n"
			"	typically multiline with body indented\n";
		return NULL;

        case CLI_GENERATE:
                if (a->pos > e->args)
                        return NULL;
        	return ast_cli_complete(a->word, choices, a->n);

        default:        
                // we are guaranteed to be called with argc >= e->args;
                if (a->argc > e->args + 1) // we accept one extra argument
                        return CLI_SHOWUSAGE;
                ast_cli(a->fd, "done this well for %s\n", e->args[argc-1]);
                return CLI_SUCCESS;
        }
}

\endcode
