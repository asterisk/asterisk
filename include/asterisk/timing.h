	\brief Timing source management
	\author Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>
	\author Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	Portions of Asterisk require a timing source, a periodic trigger
	for media handling activities. The functions in this file allow
	a loadable module to provide a timing source for Asterisk and its
	modules, so that those modules can request a 'timing handle' when
	they require one. These handles are file descriptors, which can be
	used with select() or poll().

	The timing source used by Asterisk must provide the following
	features:

	1) Periodic triggers, with a configurable interval (specified as
		 number of triggers per second).

	2) Multiple outstanding triggers, each of which must be 'acked'
		 to clear it. Triggers must also be 'ackable' in quantity.

	3) Continuous trigger mode, which when enabled causes every call
		 to poll() on the timer handle to immediately return.

	4) Multiple 'event types', so that the code using the timer can
		 know whether the wakeup it received was due to a periodic trigger
		 or a continuous trigger.
