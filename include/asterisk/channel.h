/*! \page Def_Channel Asterisk Channels
	\par What is a Channel?
	A phone call through Asterisk consists of an incoming
	connection and an outbound connection. Each call comes
	in through a channel driver that supports one technology,
	like SIP, DAHDI, IAX2 etc.
	\par
	Each channel driver, technology, has it's own private
	channel or dialog structure, that is technology-dependent.
	Each private structure is "owned" by a generic Asterisk
	channel structure, defined in channel.h and handled by
	channel.c .
	\par Call scenario
	This happens when an incoming call arrives to Asterisk
	-# Call arrives on a channel driver interface
	-# Channel driver creates a PBX channel and starts a
	   pbx thread on the channel
	-# The dial plan is executed
	-# At this point at least two things can happen:
		-# The call is answered by Asterisk and
		   Asterisk plays a media stream or reads media
		-# The dial plan forces Asterisk to create an outbound
		   call somewhere with the dial (see \ref app_dial.c)
		   application
	.

	\par Bridging channels
	If Asterisk dials out this happens:
	-# Dial creates an outbound PBX channel and asks one of the
	   channel drivers to create a call
	-# When the call is answered, Asterisk bridges the media streams
	   so the caller on the first channel can speak with the callee
	   on the second, outbound channel
	-# In some cases where we have the same technology on both
	   channels and compatible codecs, a native bridge is used.
	   In a native bridge, the channel driver handles forwarding
	   of incoming audio to the outbound stream internally, without
	   sending audio frames through the PBX.
	-# In SIP, theres an "external native bridge" where Asterisk
	   redirects the endpoint, so audio flows directly between the
	   caller's phone and the callee's phone. Signalling stays in
	   Asterisk in order to be able to provide a proper CDR record
	   for the call.


	\par Masquerading channels
	In some cases, a channel can masquerade itself into another
	channel. This happens frequently in call transfers, where
	a new channel takes over a channel that is already involved
	in a call. The new channel sneaks in and takes over the bridge
	and the old channel, now a zombie, is hung up.

/*! \page Def_Bridge Asterisk Channel Bridges

	In Asterisk, there's several media bridges.

	The Core bridge handles two channels (a "phone call") and bridge
	them together.

	The conference bridge (meetme) handles several channels simultaneously
	with the support of an external timer (DAHDI timer). This is used
	not only by the Conference application (meetme) but also by the
	page application and the SLA system introduced in 1.4.
	The conference bridge does not handle video.

	When two channels of the same type connect, the channel driver
	or the media subsystem used by the channel driver (i.e. RTP)
	can create a native bridge without sending media through the
	core.

	Native bridging can be disabled by a number of reasons,
	like DTMF being needed by the core or codecs being incompatible
	so a transcoding module is needed.

/*!
 * \page AstChannel ast_channel locking and reference tracking
 *
 * \par Creating Channels
 * A channel is allocated using the ast_channel_alloc() function.  When created, it is
 * automatically inserted into the main channels hash table that keeps track of all
 * active channels in the system.  The hash key is based on the channel name.  Because
 * of this, if you want to change the name, you _must_ use ast_change_name(), not change
 * the name field directly.  When ast_channel_alloc() returns a channel pointer, you now
 * hold both a reference to that channel and a lock on the channel. Once the channel has
 * been set up the lock can be released. In most cases the reference is given to ast_pbx_run().
 *
 * \par Channel Locking
 * There is a lock associated with every ast_channel.  It is allocated internally via astobj2.
 * To lock or unlock a channel, you must use the ast_channel_lock() wrappers.
 *
 * Previously, before ast_channel was converted to astobj2, the channel lock was used in some
 * additional ways that are no longer necessary.  Before, the only way to ensure that a channel
 * did not disappear out from under you if you were working with a channel outside of the channel
 * thread that owns it, was to hold the channel lock.  Now, that is no longer necessary.
 * You simply must hold a reference to the channel to ensure it does not go away.
 *
 * The channel must be locked if you need to ensure that data that you reading from the channel
 * does not change while you access it.  Further, you must hold the channel lock if you are
 * making a non-atomic change to channel data.
 *
 * \par Channel References
 * There are multiple ways to get a reference to a channel.  The first is that you hold a reference
 * to a channel after creating it.  The other ways involve using the channel search or the channel
 * traversal APIs.  These functions are the ast_channel_get_*() functions or ast_channel_iterator_*()
 * functions.  Once a reference is retrieved by one of these methods, you know that the channel will
 * not go away.  So, the channel should only get locked as needed for data access or modification.
 * But, make sure that the reference gets released when you are done with it!
 *
 * There are different things you can do when you are done with a reference to a channel.  The first
 * is to simply release the reference using ast_channel_unref().  The other option is to call
 * ast_channel_release().  This function is generally used where ast_channel_free() was used in
 * the past.  The release function releases a reference as well as ensures that the channel is no
 * longer in the global channels container.  That way, the channel will get destroyed as soon as any
 * other pending references get released.
 *
 * \par Exceptions to the rules
 * Even though ast_channel is reference counted, there are some places where pointers to an ast_channel
 * get stored, but the reference count does not reflect it.  The reason is mostly historical.
 * The only places where this happens should be places where because of how the code works, we
 * _know_ that the pointer to the channel will get removed before the channel goes away.  The main
 * example of this is in channel drivers.  Channel drivers generally store a pointer to their owner
 * ast_channel in their technology specific pvt struct.  In this case, the channel drivers _know_
 * that this pointer to the channel will be removed in time, because the channel's hangup callback
 * gets called before the channel goes away.

 *
 * Prior to adding this function, the call completion core attempted to figure this
 * out for itself by stripping the technology off the channel's name. However, in the

 * are defined, the channel driver must have a queryoption callback defined in its

 *
 * If a channel driver does not have a queryoption callback or if the queryoption callback
 * does not handle AST_OPTION_CC_AGENT_TYPE, then the old behavior of using the technology
 * portion of the channel name is used instead. This is perfectly suitable for channel drivers
 * whose channel technologies are a one-to-one match with the agent types defined within.
