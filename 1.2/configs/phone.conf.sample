; Select a mode, either the phone jack provides dialtone, reads digits,
; then starts PBX with the given extension (dialtone mode), or 
; immediately provides the PBX without reading any digits or providing 
; any dialtone (this is the immediate mode, the default).  Also, you
; can set the mode to "fxo" if you have a linejack to make it operate
; properly.

; If you want to change default gain value (1.0 =~ 100%) for device, simple
; add txgain or rxgain line before device line. But rememeber, if you change
; volume all cards listed below will be affected by these values. You can
; use float values (1.0, 0.5, 2.0) or percentage values (100%, 150%, 50%).
