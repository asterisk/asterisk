<h3>User Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>ast_coredumper: check ast_debug_tools.conf permissions</h4>
  ast_debug_tools.conf must be owned by root and not be
  writable by other users or groups to be used by ast_coredumper or
  by ast_logescalator or ast_loggrabber when run as root.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrade Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>http.c: Change httpstatus to default disabled and sanitize output.</h4>
  To prevent possible security issues, the <code>/httpstatus</code> page
  served by the internal web server is now disabled by default.  To explicitly
  enable it, set <code>enable_status=yes</code> in http.conf.</li>

<h4>xml.c: Replace XML_PARSE_NOENT with XML_PARSE_NONET for xmlReadFile.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>The xmlReadFile XML_PARSE_NOENT flag, which allows parsing of external
  entities, could allow a potential XXE injection attack.  Replacing it with
  XML_PARSE_NONET, which prevents network access, is safer.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-85x7-54wr-vh42</p>
<h4>ast_coredumper: check ast_debug_tools.conf permissions</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>Prevent ast_coredumper from using ast_debug_tools.conf files that are
  not owned by root or are writable by other users or groups.</p>
<p>Prevent ast_logescalator and ast_loggrabber from doing the same if
  they are run as root.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-rvch-3jmx-3jf3</p>
<p>UserNote: ast_debug_tools.conf must be owned by root and not be
  writable by other users or groups to be used by ast_coredumper or
  by ast_logescalator or ast_loggrabber when run as root.</p>
<h4>http.c: Change httpstatus to default disabled and sanitize output.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>To address potential security issues, the httpstatus page is now disabled
  by default and the echoed query string and cookie output is html-escaped.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-v6hp-wh3r-cwxh</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: To prevent possible security issues, the <code>/httpstatus</code> page
  served by the internal web server is now disabled by default.  To explicitly
  enable it, set <code>enable_status=yes</code> in http.conf.</p>
<h4>ast_coredumper: create gdbinit file with restrictive permissions</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>Modify gdbinit to use the install command with explicit permissions (-m 600)
  when creating the .ast_coredumper.gdbinit file. This ensures the file is
  created with restricted permissions (readable/writable only by the owner)
  to avoid potential privilege escalation.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-xpc6-x892-v83c</p>
